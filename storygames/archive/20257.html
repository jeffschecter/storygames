Heck yes! And that's fine! </small><br/>Because getting on the same page about which techniques are kosher and which are iffy is SUPER IMPORTANT to us humans! It's the outside-in approach to finding common value ground!<br/><br/>Now what is GDNS? It stands for Gam, Dram, Narr and Sim!<br/><br/>In Dram, one or more of the participants is a super talented story writer in the attic and pre-writes a very interesting story that the group can then bring to life and experience in full color at the gaming table! This could be a GM writing "First the players are gonna do X, then they're gonna do Y, then they're gonna do Z" style notes before play, this could be a player writing ten pages of backstory for their character which is going to be recounted closely during play!<br/><br/>In Narr, one or more of the participants is a hippie! They want to encounter choices that would be meaningful diegetically, such as "Should the hard-working cop abandon her family in order to protect them?". The most important life dream of a Narr hippie is that a very unexpected story is created during play that can then be retold to your hippie friends at the next con!<br/><br/>In Gam, one or more of the participants is a power-hungry munchkin! They want to encounter choices that would be meaningful mechanically, such as "Should the hard-working cop equip a +1 one beastmaster sword or a x3 mod lightning round gun in order to best protect her family?". The most important life dream of a Gam munchkin is to test their own might! To face challenges and bravely stare them down with their lifelong journey of system mastery!<br/><br/>In Sim, one or more of the participants is a curious individual! They want to examine the clockwork of the system, how will the little ants in the sandhill move around and what will happen when they collide! The most important life dream of a curious and imaginative Sim daydreamer is to see their doll's house come to life and see the dolls do What They Would've Done Really. If they were alive. But with spaceships.<br/><br/>Wait, there's more!<br/>These four corners of the GDNS quartet may sound like mortal enemies. But that's not the case, they are the best of friends!<br/>Here is the official poster for the GDNS kumbaya of FRIENDSHIP:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/gdns_friendship.png"/><br/><br/>But not everything is a paradise in the GDNS land!<br/>Here is the official diagram of the official GDNS Hatred Parade of Eternal Enmity:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/gdns_enmity.png"/><br/><br/>Any questions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446224/#Comment_446224" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T18:27:54+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  6:27PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out this article:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134842/personality_and_play_styles_a_.php?page=3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134842/personality_and_play_styles_a_.php?page=3</a><br/><br/>"<i>This leaves undescribed the preference for raw sensation.

It can just as easily be Gamist or Simulationist. And, I think, Fiasco is more supporting of Sim than of Narr - however, I wouldn't be surprised if some gamers felt otherwise.

(In my case, I re-reappropriated them because I wanted to bring them more inline with threefold era usage.) Then no more "Well, what Ron <i>really</i> meant was that Fiasco was a Gamist game meant as a next step up from optimizing 3.5 Druids, that should be clear as day".<br/><br/>I'm of two minds of this. Part of the motivation for GDNS official, canonical theory was to finally bring some sense and order back into these terms.<br/><br/>But I want try something and see how it's received, whether it works better or worse.<br/>Thus, I present to you, a sneak preview of a beta of a maybe kinda release candidate of the 1.1 version of GDNS official, canonical theory. This is a test version, it has not been canonized and made official... yet! Here it is, the theory that might one day replace the glorious 1.0 version:<br/><br/><small>You may have heard of some older theory called "GNS" and "Creative Agenda" which talked about "why we play" and which aesthetic principles were important to the players.<br/><br/>In GDNS, the talk is instead about <em>how</em> we play and about what even constitutes play.<br/>Overlap with GNS "Technical Agenda"? Heck yes! And that's fine! </small><br/>Because getting on the same page about which techniques are kosher and which are iffy is SUPER IMPORTANT to us humans! It's the outside-in approach to finding common value ground!<br/><br/>Now what is GDNS? GDNS stands for Gnusto, Blorb, Nitfol and Frotz!<br/><br/>In Gnusto, one or more of the participants is a super talented story writer in the attic and pre-writes a very interesting story that the group can then bring to life and experience in full color at the gaming table! This could be a GM writing "First the players are gonna do X, then they're gonna do Y, then they're gonna do Z" style notes before play, this could be a player writing ten pages of backstory for their character which is going to be recounted closely during play!<br/><br/>In Nitfol, one or more of the participants is a hippie! They want to encounter choices that would be meaningful diegetically, such as "Should the hard-working cop abandon her family in order to protect them?". The most important life dream of a Nitfol hippie is that a very unexpected story is created during play that can then be retold to your hippie friends at the next con!<br/><br/>In Frotz, one or more of the participants is a power-hungry munchkin! They want to encounter choices that would be meaningful mechanically, such as "Should the hard-working cop equip a +1 one beastmaster sword or a x3 mod lightning round gun in order to best protect her family?". The most important life dream of a Frotz munchkin is to test their own might! To face challenges and bravely stare them down with their lifelong journey of system mastery!<br/><br/>In Blorb, one or more of the participants is a curious individual! They want to examine the clockwork of the system, how will the little ants in the sandhill move around and what will happen when they collide! The most important life dream of a curious and imaginative Blorb daydreamer is to see their doll's house come to life and see the dolls do What They Would've Done Really. If they were alive. But with spaceships.<br/><br/>Wait, there's more!<br/>These four corners of the GDNS quartet may sound like mortal enemies. But that's not the case, they are the best of friends!<br/>Here is the official poster for the GDNS kumbaya of FRIENDSHIP:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/gdns_friendship_2.png"/><br/><br/>But not everything is a paradise in the GDNS land!<br/>Here is the official diagram of the official GDNS Hatred Parade of Eternal Enmity:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/gdns_enmity_2.png"/><br/><br/>Any questions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453487/#Comment_453487" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-22T17:05:45+00:00" title="May 22, 2016  5:05PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2016 5:06PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it!

Is that right?<br/><br/>When I write programs I have a rule for myself, one that I decided early on and have followed. If I have the slightest bit of doubt what the right name for a function is, I put in frobnicate, and for variables I put in foo, bar, quux, xyzzy etc. The idea being called "frobnicate", the function can be created without being attached to some iffy or half-formed concept, it will be a pure and great function and when it's done, tested, I immediately rename it (I'm motivated to rename quickly because I can only have one frobnicate per namespace, right?). This avoids all bad and half-baked function names like "LDAPConnectionManagingKeeper" and it also frees up my thinking on the function in order to make the function's code as neat, efficient and clear as can be. I can see if the finished function resembles any known programming patterns (and I have a whole bunch of my own) and reference those in the name, for example.<br/><br/>Similarly, I'll gladly consider good and descriptive names once the definitions of these four corners have been completely conveyed and not risked mixing up with concepts from my main competitor, the self-proclaimed "big" model.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453492/#Comment_453492" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-22T17:29:30+00:00" title="May 22, 2016  5:29PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2016 5:29PM by 2097.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frotz is a light spell.

Both agendas seek visceral thrills and raw emotion. The exception would be Social Tammys, which are closer to Robin Laws's Casual Gamer: someone who plays to interact with their friends. These Social Tammys also have some overlap with Stewart's Idealist/Socializer, which he equates to GNS Narrativism.\n<blockquote>So why does Johnny play Magic? Because Johnny wants to express something. To Johnny, Magic is an opportunity to show the world something about himself, be it how creative he is or how clever he is or how offbeat he is.</blockquote>\nJenny seems most like Gnusto/Dram to me. Both focus on preparing content (a deck, a story, an environment, etc.) and then showing that content off to other people (your gaming group, your local game store, the Internet, etc.) Jennies, I think, are also the people that like to make levels, maps, or mods for digital games. I'd guess a lot of game designers are also Jennies; Rosewater himself identifies as one.<br/><br/>Rosewater has also discussed <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/vorthos-and-mel-2015-08-31" rel="nofollow">Vorthos and Mel</a>, two "aesthetic profiles" that are distinct from the psychographics. I think there are some similarities between Mel and Blorb/Sim, and perhaps Vorthos and Nitfol/Narr, but I'm not sure whether we should apply them to the model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453519/#Comment_453519" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-23T23:19:52+00:00" title="May 23, 2016 11:19PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I... kinda talked about Vorthos and Mel upthread?<br/>And that Tammy overlaps all four corners.

Sorry about that.<br/><br/>Can you elaborate on the difference between the "why" of GNS versus the "how" of GDNS? My impression of Forge theory is that the goal is to have all players agree on a Creative Agenda <i>for this game, with these people</i>, and that the agreed-upon Creative Agenda is simply what action wins out in cases of Agenda Clash. If this is the case, how the group plays seems to be a function of why each player plays.<br/><br/>I agree that min-maxers are a kind of "mechanical" Jenny. I was thinking about Jennies and Gnusto after my previous post, and I think this might be another axis, rather than a separate agenda. Each agenda might have players who enjoy having content created before sitting down at the table, and those who enjoy creating content at the table.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453523/#Comment_453523" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-24T07:02:48+00:00" title="May 24, 2016  7:02AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The official poster for the GDNS kumbaya of FRIENDSHIP is one way to try to resolve agenda clash, to find common ground. I think the core idea is when there's a feeling of "You can't do that, that's\u2026 that's cheating, that's going against what RPGs even are", there might be a GDNS official, canonical theory issue.<br/><br/>Yeah, just like Mel and Vorthos are on two separate axes from the plane of T/J/S, so is GDNS official, canonical theory on a separate plane. I can easily imagine a Jenny-Frotz.<br/><br/>I think a difference between GDNS official, canonical theory and GNS (note that I'm not an expert on my competitor's model) is that I think Ron is a strict "narrativist" in the GNS whereas I'm into all three of the "play to find out" corners of the GDNS official, canonical theory.<br/>I also bring a strong emotional engagement (Tammy) and a desire for self-expression (Jenny), and an appreciation for well-designed mechanics (Mel) (not saying I'm any good at those things, just that that's what I like).<br/><br/>In the GNS, I have no idea where I supposedly belong, nor where my opposite, the frustrated novelist, belongs. Which is fine, I'm no longer interested in the competing model.<br/><br/>As for names, OK, so far Petra for Blorb seems like the best.

I know it can be an end in itself even with pretty low emphasis on resonant experience, similar to "I'm down for whatever, as long as it's immersive."  But I suppose that could be lumped in with other technical agendas like "I want to play something with lots of dice rolling."  I dunno.  From among the technical agendas which are also reasons to play, transportation stands out to me, but that might be highly subjective.  <br/><br/>I feel like "immersion as goal or top priority" beyond just virtual experience ought to be represented somehow.

For example, railroading is very appropriate here but some types of railroading might or might not be undesired by participants for reasons unrelated to the genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453800/#Comment_453800" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-11T06:48:06+00:00" title="June 11, 2016  6:48AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2016 6:49AM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the first category I would select techniques from Petra/Blorb and from Nitfol. For the second two, I would select techniques primarily from Blorb, with careful additions from Frotz and Nitfol.<br/><br/>For the fourth, I'd take everything in Gnusto's and Nitfol's toolboxes and put them in a big box and say: participants and designers, select delightful and enjoyable techniques from here, and leave the unwanted ones.<br/><br/>Maybe this is a good way to think of GDNS official, canonical theory: as toolboxes for people with very clashing ideals. That look at each other's toolbox and say: "Mmm, that's a tasty-looking spanner you have there but what's that gross hammer doing in there? You can't roleplay for real with such a thing around!" And some of these toolboxes map to one corner, and others of these toolboxes map to an overlap in the official poster for the GDNS kumbaya of FRIENDSHIP.<br/><br/>Like "Stories are interesting" is one toolbox that contain everything that Gnuste and Nitfol has, while Gnusto alone looks at Nitfol and says "Those tools are inappropriate, you'd ruin my wonderful plot" and Nitfol looks at Gnusto and says "No, <em>those</em> tools are inappropriate, you'd take away my delicious choices". Whereas "Stories are interesting" looks at them both and says "Girls, girls\u2026 you both have great tools for my purpose"<br/><br/>(That's not to say that the overlap is "better" than pure Nitfol.

I read your last post with ZERO idea of what's what - I think I'd have to read your posts with the diagram printed out in front of me to follow at all.)<br/><br/>Dave,<br/><br/>I'm sorry! I still don't understand. I suspect it's because, in my mind, the term "virtual experience" is basically synonymous with "feeling like I'm there" (which is how you define "transportation", I think).<br/><br/>How can one experience "awe and wonder, exploration, discovery" without feeling "transportation"? Can you think of an example? <br/><br/>Is that the feeling of exploring and discovering an imaginary place *without* feeling like you're there? I'm not sure what that looks like. All I can think of is, say, reading a sourcebook and being excited about what's inside; but that's not really compatible with "anxiety, fear, thrill ride".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>GDNS official, canonical theory!! - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20257/gdns-official-canonical-theory/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="GDNS official, canonical theory!! - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20257/gdns-official-canonical-theory/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Paul, no prob.

That look at each other's toolbox and say: "Mmm, that's a tasty-looking spanner you have there but what's that gross hammer doing in there? You can't roleplay for real with such a thing around!" And some of these toolboxes map to one corner, and others of these toolboxes map to an overlap in the official poster for the GDNS kumbaya of FRIENDSHIP.</blockquote>If the contents of those toolboxes were defined, I think that would be a pretty awesome way to look at things.  "Roleplaying to Roleplay could use some techniques from Running a Simulation" doesn't get me anywhere currently, but if I got to then go look in a "Simulation Techniques" box, then it would become super handy.<br/><br/>Your point about toolboxes also existing in overlaps strikes me as complicated and inconvenient on the technique-listing front, but also true.<br/><br/>I wonder if the clashes and overlaps you're seeing could help generate a starter list of techniques just for reference?  If you put that in place, maybe the rest of us could help expand the lists.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to parse the four points as defined by clash, as I see plenty of room for clash pretty near any given point.  Like, yeah, I agree that <i>some</i> "Run a Sim" techniques are perfect for Transportation, but <i>others</i> will completely ruin it (e.g. in the case of a simulation based on slow-handling quantification).

I like the name "Petra" for Blorb but that's the only one out of the four.<br/><br/>The reason for these opaque names are actually because of your post that started comparing GDNS official, canonical theory to the big model which uses some similar names for some things, which kinda was my fault with the original names. I wanted to "Pull a Ron" like Ron did with threefold and just define things the way I had interpreted them. But I think for the long term benefit of GDNS official, canonical theory, these four corners need other names and the entire GDNS official, canonical theory needs a new name too (because what's G, D, N and S stand for now?)\n<blockquote>Your point about toolboxes also existing in overlaps strikes me as complicated and inconvenient on the technique-listing front, but also true.</blockquote>\nYeah, I think it'll help with clarity especially if I can sort of put the techniques in a diagram.\n<blockquote>I wonder if the clashes and overlaps you're seeing could help generate a starter list of techniques just for reference?

BTW, slow-handling quantification is a great tool for VE, right? That boardgame feeling of seeing exactly how many torches it takes to reach the core of the dungeon.<br/><br/>As far as transportation goes. I've spoken earlier at length about the different "emotional engagement" vs "sensory engagement". Blorb techniques help with either of those two, and both of those two are needed for good Transportation.<br/>Not all techniques are designed equal though. A technique can be bad, or not be the best thing for what it's meant to do, if there's a simpler alternative that does the same thing with about as good, or better, results, even though both techniques ostensibly would be in the same corner.

Impartial refeering I want for both blorb and frotz but there is no blorb+frotz overlap in the official poster for the GDNS kumbaya of FRIENDSHIP so I added it to Nitfol too. A sign of a problem with the model, perhaps?<br/>Character backstory was already there under a different name, renamed.<br/>I also added the Everway Fortune, Drama, Karma.\n<blockquote>Character backstory and change can add to even a prepped GM plot</blockquote>\nOh, I want to address this too. Some things, like "write down what you know about your character in some way" or "people sit around a table" can apply to <i>all</i> categories; I don't want to add them and maybe some are already in there and will need to be removed.<br/><br/>For that specific example, though, one of two other things are going on.<br/>First of all, I'd argue that symbolic bones thrown at the other player types is a <i>fundamental</i> part of Gnusto. Put in a couple of kobolds to fight and a weird statue to talk to keep the players engaged as they follow along the plot.<br/><br/>Second of all, you might be playing an overlap. Overlaps can use techniques from the toolboxes within it. Maybe you're playing "Stories are interesting" instead of Gnusto or Nitfol alone.<br/><br/>Third. In the original post I put character backstory solidly in Gnusto. Nitfol to me is more about how the character is <i>in play</i>, even backgrounds created in play through flashback mechanics. But... isn't writing down "what has gone before", even if thoroughly, acceptable in all four modes? Both world building and character building.

For example, if you're using "Players interact with the DM's prep", are there no appropriate resolution methods? One or more of F, D or K is applicable to every game I've ever seen.<br/><br/>So I think this is what's going on:<br/>"Players interact with the DM's prep" have access to all of Frotz, Gnusto and Blorb.<br/>Frotz (for example) have access to Everway "Karma" through "Play to find out".<br/>Therefore "Players interact with the DM's prep" have access to "Karma" and the other three methods too.<br/><br/>Hold on, this looks circular, I'm in a bit of hurry now but the strict definition in my head isn't circular.<br/>The overlaps when engaged directly have access to all of their corner's techniques.<br/>The overlaps when referenced indirectly have access only to their specific, shared techniques.<br/>Done, loop closed. This is going to be made clearer in the diagram (somehow...)<br/><br/>OK, good. But there was something else that struck me as weird. That there's no Blorb/Frotz w/o Nitfol. I guess I'm just a big ole' "Play to find out" lover and can't imagine giving up some Nitfol techniques, even though Blorb is nominally my favorite corner I guess it's more "Play to find out" I'm after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453839/#Comment_453839" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-13T18:26:11+00:00" title="June 13, 2016  6:26PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My inclination would be to fill the techniques list with stuff that's highly associated with a given category -- either really important and at least fairly common or really common and at least fairly important -- and not worry about what other categories such techniques might also happen to fit into in a less foundational way.<br/><br/>So, like, if character backstory is vital to Gnutso, and some degree of maybe awesome maybe not in other play styles, then we put it on the Gnutso list, and readers can always mine from multiple lists if they want.<br/><br/>As for where to put a technique that is equally foundational to Gnutso and Nitfol and Stories Are Interesting, I don't know.

Obviously, very detailed mechanics are grist for the mill for good frotz design but it can come at a high cost. Frotz is related to the old "system mastery" idea,  which has traditionally stuck to a particular iiee scheme, but I think good, clear, clean frotz games can be designed with other mechanics. The Burning games comes to mind, as does Fate.

Dark Dungeons? ACKS? Swords &amp; Wizardry, Searchers of the Unknown (this especially since the characters are so simple and unfrotzy/unnitfoly), The Black Hack (also similar to SotU)<br/><b>Frotz</b> -- D&amp;D 4e, Torchbearer.... Rune?<br/><b>Nitfol</b> -- Psychodrame, Hillfolk<br/><br/>In general:<br/><br/><b>Gnusto</b> -- games written to with ease allow play to follow along one story<br/><b>Frotz</b> -- games where system mastery is difficult and interesting<br/><b>Nitfol</b> -- low-prep games with interesting and loaded characters<br/><b>Blorb</b> -- higher-prep world-building sandbox games where "what happens happens" is more important than genre emulation<br/><br/>What are some games that, deliberately or undeliberately, straddle the corners?<br/><b>GURPS</b> -- based on a super blorby, almost unwieldy "physics" core with a quantumy and gnustic illusionist adventure design model<br/><b>Everway</b> -- strong nitfoly characters with their own quests landed in a realm with One Big Thing To Fix a la gnusto<br/><b>Pathfinder</b> -- frotzy "build" oriented challenge game play arranged in linear shared gnustic experiences, and the builds are based on a hypercodified, anti-MTP physics engine with blorby aspirations (one of the worst games ever? or best, depending on what you want)<br/><b>Burning Wheel</b> -- all about frotzy system mastery but play is driven by nitfoly powerful characters in a lower-prep setting, a successful marriage between frotz &amp; nitfol.<br/><b>AW</b> -- all nitfol all the time but in a way that makes it look and feel as if it were a blorb game. Exploration and interaction and the outcomes "emulate" it being blorb, look like it being blorb but under the hood? No blorb!<br/><b>CoC</b> and <b>ToC</b> -- gnustic "funnel" play towards Big Reveals that is punctuated by mechanical interactions that can add some blorby surprises<br/><b>Durance</b> -- At a glance looks like textbook nitfol, but the planet generation system adds a strong blorby touch.<br/><b>Dungeon World</b> -- As AW, but sometimes you use an old module and adherence to it adds significant blorbiness<br/><b>Fate</b> -- Can be run all-nitfol but can also be used with significantly blorby prep.<br/><br/><br/>Some more one-corner game guesses but where I'm less sure:<br/><b>Nitfol</b> -- Fiasco, Archipelago, Svart av Kval<br/><b>????</b> -- WoD. WoD has fluctuated over the years, often staying firmly in one corner but later shifting <i>completely</i> over to another corner. Blorby "by night" books made way for gnustic chronicles and SAS-books and then switched back to "Damnation City" style blorb play.<br/><br/><br/>I'm not sure about any of these and can be convinced to move some of them over.<br/>But.<br/>If the explanation for why something really belongs in another corner is too clever, then it's probably not a straight forward case. Like "Toon is really sim because it simulates a cartoon, get it <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>" and the same for Feng Shui. Naw. Those two games try to tell a nitfoly or gnustic story, not be a blorby petri dish, and I guess both add significant frotzy elements, especially FS. They are not blorb, the definition of blorb specifically excludes this "genre emulation" aspect. This is part of the canonical and official definition of what blorb is.<br/><br/><br/>Also. Remember that a core tenet of gnusto is to throw the other playstyles some symbolic bones. It's like one of the gnusto participants Core Commandments. That's why we often see gnusto play using Fantasy AGE and GURPS and stuff like that. Players believe there are some meaningful mechanics, and those mechanics are some or even most of the time used to create some interesting outcomes and things happening within the gnustic "canyon", but the canyon is nevertheless leading forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454734/#Comment_454734" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-07T09:30:48+00:00" title="July  7, 2016  9:30AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weirdly enough, the way that I ran my games for many many years don't fit into any of the corners. That's how dysfunctional I consider it now <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/>It had many of the hallmarks of gnusto play [no illusionary mechanics though, that was one tenet I refused]; the characters were often pregens, everything was made to fit in with my visions and my ideas and everything went like <i>I</i> thought it should go. It was awful.<br/><br/>But I refused to see myself as gnusto because <i>nothing was written down</i>, it wasn't a railroad because there was no road, I just made up everything as we went a long! But... that made it in practice way <i>less</i> agential.<br/><br/>I was (for a period before my head injuries) pretty good at just spouting out made up stories on the fly, long shaggy dog stories that just went on and on and "this happens, then this happens" etc. And... my RPG was similar to this. They were stories and the characters were in them but they weren't, the players weren't really affecting what was going on. They were there to portray my pregens according to my idea on how to portray the pregens. I dunno. <i>It sucked.</i> A lot of the things I independently invented "like ok you steal this and this from that and that person, why and what happens?", they have later been embraced as part of "loaded questions" type play. But for me they were really a tone police thing, I was forbidding the players from doing interesting things and I was forcing them to do other interesting things. So horrible.<br/><br/>In my defense, remember, I grew up in the isolated country side, far from any RPG community, with only 90's games at my disposal and I discarded them as too rules heavy [I (correctly) identified them as gnusto games and thought... "then why are all these complicated rules here? The rules aren't being used"] and started down the path of my "dictorial freeforming", Everway, Fudge and SLUG taken to their extreme, without the bars that prevented them from becoming completely singularly-visioned.<br/><br/>That's an explanation, not a compensation. It was awful! And I had a hard time getting players.<br/><br/>Now, as I mentioned the other day, some completely orthogonal parts of our play was amazing; we were completely immersed with <i>everything</i> being said IC and we were always maintaining the mood, sustained for hours and hours. [I wasn't the only local GM that did this. We were goth kids and we took our playing Very Seriously.]<br/>AND my monsters and stories and ideas and pregens <i>were</i> pretty good. We were very happy with how some of the games turned out and I did have a few appreciative players.<br/><br/><br/>But. I'm so glad I got that "magic mirror" experience.

[...]</blockquote>\nFor people who are proponents of the idea of "creative agenda" (I am one), this is precisely where the idea comes from:<br/><br/>You're describing a game where the participants have no idea how to make their contributions meaningful. <br/><br/>There is no compass here, not for the players, nor - really - for the GM. Everyone is floating with a great sense of uncertainty, and they can't judge which contributions will be beneficial and which will not. <br/><br/>This makes it very difficult (though not impossible!) to have a functional, fun game. And, if the game IS fun, we have no idea how to recreate that fun. <br/><br/>A game with some kind of creative focus, however, allows everyone some sense of "what the valid game moves are". Other games have this same issue, but on a smaller scale: for instance, I'm going to play soccer quite differently if I know we're playing competitively (when the ball goes out of bounds, I can go after it slowly, to conserve my strength) vs. playing just to get some exercise (might as well keep running!) vs. playing so you can teach me the basic skills (we might work together intentionally to recreate situations where I'm losing, to see if I can figure out how to get out of them).<br/><br/>You'll note I used the lower case in the term "creative agenda", because people often disagree about where to draw classifications. But I believe that <i>the idea itself</i> is undeniable - there are games which share a creative drive and games which do not.<br/><br/>On the Forge, games which had a creative agenda which was recognized by all the players (not necessarily overtly! It could be a tacit understanding) were called "coherent". Games that weren't were called "incoherent". This wasn't intended as a term of value or judgement (the terms come from "coherent light" vs. "incoherent light" - neither is "better" than the other, they just describe different properties), but many people took it that way (and the Model itself could be said to imply as much).<br/><br/>People tend to disagree on this point. Some people play in an "incoherent" style and have fun, functional games. Heck, probably the majority of happy gamers do this! The Model certainly didn't exclude this possibility. Other people intentionally play in an "incoherent" style and even assert that <i>it is a better way to play</i> (for various reasons - more inclusivity, more flexibility, to better please all the participants, etc).<br/><br/>I don't see a particular need to settle on particular classifications (although I do personally find the Forgite Creative Agendas useful much of the time), because I think that the creative agenda of a <i>specific</i> game/group will always override any general "category" it might fall into.<br/><br/>For example, I've seen some people play D&amp;D4E as a string of combat encounters. Within each encounter, the players try to win as hard as possible, and the DM does the same. Between encounters, however, the players are not trying to "win" anything, but rather willingly participate in the DM's plot, so they can get to the next planned encounter.<br/><br/>Whether this is "coherent" or not is kind of an academic question, I think. The important part is that if you join the game and you try to "play along" during a fight ("I'm going to let myself get captured by the Orcs, because that sounds like what the DM wants!") or try to outsmart the DM during the interludes between encounters, you're going to risk ruining the game for everyone.<br/><br/>My own pre-Forge games were somewhat like yours, Sandra. I had minimal mechanics going on, in a loose style which aimed at light simulation (generally of the "physics simulation" sort) and I would "craft" a story out of the players' input. However, I would also use "gloracle" techniques to resolve situations as much as possible, and then use <i>that</i> as creative input to inspire the next step of the story.<br/><br/>It was functional, and the players enjoyed it a great deal. However, it was tremendously draining for me as the GM. Although it looked like I was simply acting as "referee", the absence of things like stated intent on the player side meant that, at some level, I was making up everything which happened in play. Very satisfying at times, as it gave me such a high level of creative control over the game. <br/><br/>However, ultimately I felt overworked and unsupported. After all, since the players couldn't really know what the game's creative agenda WAS, they sometimes worked towards it and sometimes against it. I had to compensate for that every step of the way. More importantly, I yearned to share the creative input, to have people participate actively to make the game better. The players were intelligent, creative, and proactive, but the nature of the resolution system meant everything ultimately landed back on my shoulders. There were simply no "surprises" for me anymore, once I knew the players well and could predict what they would do in response to cues I gave them.<br/><br/>This has interesting side effects, like the players "not caring" about various details. You know that thing where the GM delivers important information about the game's setting or current events, and the players sit through quietly, and then forget all the NPCs' names almost instantly? Well, why don't they care about the Duke's lineage? It's because those details are simply not relevant to the way they're playing the game - they cannot see how they tie to the game's creative agenda, and therefore there is no interest in paying attention to them or remembering them. <br/><br/>For contrast, tell your players in the middle of a fight that there is a cauldron of burning oil in the middle of the room, and no one is going to skip over or forget THAT! It's immediately relevant. In the same way, no player who just created a character named Luke Skywalker is EVER going to forget who Darth Vader is. Your players might not remember the tavern keeper's name (because <i>you</i> are the only one who knows he's actually plot-relevant!) but they all definitely remember what a Tarrasque is (again, because it ties directly into the perceived creative agenda).<br/><br/>[Note: This is a rhetorical "you", not intended to be aimed at anyone in particular.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454752/#Comment_454752" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-07T20:07:42+00:00" title="July  7, 2016  8:07PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify that yes, even though I want to distance myself from the big model (I think two of the four corners of the GDNS official, canonical theory are pretty similar to two of the big model's three corners, but the other two are very different from anything the big model has), I think it's the same basic thing here.

It's only once all the "toys" are on the table that the MC can act more like a referee, if that's what you're looking for. <br/><br/>In a way, it's like you're creating the module together, during the first session or two, and with the MC filling in the gaps in prep. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462182/#Comment_462182" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T08:56:52+00:00" title="April 20, 2017  8:56AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2017 9:03AM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>Version 1.2 canonically and officially released! Changes include new names for the four corners, + removing the misconceptions about big model "how" vs "why" (thanks Simon -- now GDNS official, canonical theory can stand on its own legs!)</small><br/><br/>Because getting on the same page about which techniques are kosher and which are iffy is SUPER IMPORTANT to us humans! It's the outside-in approach to finding common value ground!<br/><br/>Now what is GDNS? It stands for Spike, Rails, Impro and Sandbox!<br/><br/>In Rails, one or more of the participants is a super talented story writer in the attic and pre-writes a very interesting story that the group can then bring to life and experience in full color at the gaming table! This could be a GM writing "First the players are gonna do X, then they're gonna do Y, then they're gonna do Z" style notes before play, this could be a player writing ten pages of backstory for their character which is going to be recounted closely during play!<br/><br/>In Impro, one or more of the participants is a hippie! They want to encounter choices that would be meaningful diegetically, such as "Should the hard-working cop abandon her family in order to protect them?". The most important life dream of a Impro hippie is that a very unexpected story is created during play that can then be retold to your hippie friends at the next con!<br/><br/>In Spike, one or more of the participants is a power-hungry munchkin! They want to encounter choices that would be meaningful mechanically, such as "Should the hard-working cop equip a +1 one beastmaster sword or a x3 mod lightning round gun in order to best protect her family?". The most important life dream of a Spike munchkin is to test their own might! To face challenges and bravely stare them down with their lifelong journey of system mastery!<br/><br/>In Sandbox, one or more of the participants is a curious individual! They want to examine the clockwork of the system, how will the little ants in the sandhill move around and what will happen when they collide! The most important life dream of a curious and imaginative Sandbox daydreamer is to see their doll's house come to life and see the dolls do What They Would've Done Really. If they were alive. But with spaceships.<br/><br/>Wait, there's more!<br/>These four corners of the GDNS quartet may sound like mortal enemies. But that's not the case, they are the best of friends!<br/>Here is the official poster for the GDNS kumbaya of FRIENDSHIP:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/gdns_friendship_3.png"/><br/><br/>But not everything is a paradise in the GDNS land!<br/>Here is the official diagram of the official GDNS Hatred Parade of Eternal Enmity:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/gdns_enmity_3.png"/><br/><br/>Any questions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462185/#Comment_462185" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T09:12:28+00:00" title="April 20, 2017  9:12AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2017 9:14AM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it should be canoncially renamed officially to RISS official, canonical theory now that the four corners have more useful names to you non-enchanter-veterans out there.
