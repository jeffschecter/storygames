This first book is a complete setting guide to the Red Cow clan, their neighbours, and their tribe, as well as nearby enemies the Telmori and the ghouls of The Woods of the Dead.<br/><br/>In this book we present enough material for you to use this as a sandbox setting. The heart of the material is over 65 NPCs (all illustrated) and their relationships. There is struggle here against not only against external threats, but internally for the future of the clan.<br/><br/>This is in essence a sandbox setting.<br/><br/>The second volume contains a year-by-year campaign from 1618-1625. Think of the Great Pendragon Campaign for format (each year is presented with events, the reactions of NPCs to those events, and a couple of episodes based around those events). If you are strictly sandbox the material here may be useful as a 'ticking clock' to prevent your sandbox turning into quicksand, but there is also a playable campaign for those who prefer that approach.<br/><br/>Feel free to ask me any questions about the product. I'll try to check in regularly.<br/><br/>Ian<br/> <br/>Table of Contents<br/><img alt="table of contents" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6819776/TCS-Contents.png"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455140/#Comment_455140" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-17T18:03:30+00:00" title="July 17, 2016  6:03PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very good, I think I'll get this book once it makes its way to my neighborhood.<br/><br/>I'll ask a question that might be stupid, but as I don't follow the day to day struggles of the related companies, and there apparently was some rearrangement last year, so it pays to be clear: the Chaosium that is publishing your book is essentially Moon Design, right? They're just using the Chaosium label from now on?<br/><br/>A second question occurs, in fact: how would you rate the canonicity of your material here? For example, what does Jeff think of it? (Or if you have other perspectives on canon, feel free to expound - I don't really know how one should truly view this, except that I know that I'm more interested in material compatible with Guide to Glorantha than not.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455145/#Comment_455145" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-17T21:25:49+00:00" title="July 17, 2016  9:25PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Moon Design Publications stepped in to save Chaosium after problems caused by the CoC 7e Kickstarter. In essence the 80s IP of Chaosium is back in one place, by a circuitous route. So yes, they are using the Chaosium label for this work.<br/><br/>Jeff was a co-author and contributed to the material. So it is canon. In fact canon was subtly adjusted when the Guide to Glorantha was written to ensure that ideas we had for this book were part of the established canon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
