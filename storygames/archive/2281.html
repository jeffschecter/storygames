                    I'm trying to wrap my head around poker-style betting and I've read up on it -- Wikipedia articles --, but I'm still not getting the actual sequence of the whole initial bet, see, raise thing, and I have a few questions. I'm trying to understand this as part of something I'm floating around in my head right now about a board/card/rpg.<br/>
<br/>
So, if there are three players is this right for one round:<br/>
<br/>
All put in 1 for the buy in.<br/>
P1: Bet 5.<br/>
P2: See. (Puts in 5.)<br/>
P3: Raise 5. (Puts in 10.)<br/>
P1: See. (Puts in 5.)<br/>
P2: See. (Puts in 5.)<br/>
Show hands.<br/>
<br/>
How many times do people normally go around per hand?<br/>
What if P1 bets so high that P2 and P3 can't see that amount?                </div>

                            It depends on the game.  Let's take a look at hold'em, which is immensely popular these days (also featured in Casino Royale):<br/><br/>Everyone "ante"s, basically putting in one low denomination (a buck) to show that "they're in this hand".<br/><br/>Two cards are dealt to each player.<br/><br/>Round of bets.<br/><br/>Three cards turned up in the center<br/><br/>Round of bets.<br/><br/>One more card turned up in the center.<br/><br/>Round of bets<br/><br/>Last card turned up in the center.<br/><br/>Round of bets, show hands.<br/><br/>Also we commonly use the word "Call" instead of "See", unless you're raising. "I'll see your 5 and raise you 5".<br/><br/>To see a lot of this, watch the awesome Matt Damon- Ed Norton flick "<b>Rounders</b>".<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Edit: For standard 5 card draw, it's <br/>Ante<br/>5 cards.<br/>Bet<br/>Everyone exchanges/tosses up to 3 cards (4 if you have an Ace, but it's generally bad form).<br/>Bet<br/>Show Cards.                        </div>

                            Bryan, your synopsis is accurate.<br/><br/>If P1 raises beyond the other players can see, either they're out of that hand cause they can't follow, or they can go all in, betting the rest of what they've got.  It depends on the game.                        </div>

                            Joshua got to it before me.<br/><br/>Incedentally, trying to force that decision is called Buying the Pot, and is in some cases a valid strategy.  It is not to be confused with Buying Pot, which is illegal.                        </div>

                            What Andy and Josh said. <br/><br/>Plus, there is a lot of poker on TV these days. I find it much easier to understand this stuff, and especially to see how much (and little) skill is involved by watching rather than reading the rules. Find one of the Poker shows (World Series of Poker, Celebrity Home Game, whatever) and watch an episode or two. Its as exciting as football and it'll teach you a lot more than reading the wiki.<br/><br/>Or, there are a few good free online poker games you can get in on. Be smart about it and all, but if you want to really get the guts of the game, ain't nothing like playing.                        </div>

                            Let's not forget re-raising, which has become a staple of televised poker when one player thinks he can drag the other guy in for higher stakes.<br/><br/>To steal...er...<i>borrow</i> the script from Bryan's original post and modify it accordingly:<br/><br/>All put in 1 for the buy in.<br/>P1: Bet 5.<br/>P2: See. (Puts in 5.)<br/>P3: Raise 5. (Puts in 10.)<br/>P1: I'm out.  (Folds.)<br/>P2: See your 5, raise another 10. (Puts in 5 to call, 10 to raise.)<br/>P3: I call.  (Puts in 10.)<br/>Show hands.<br/><br/>There's some easy drama there, because the question becomes whether player 2 has an awesome hand and was trying to lure player 3 into committing to a larger bet, or if player 3's bluffing, or...you get the point.  I've seen a game on TV where two players re-raised each other at least twice in a single round.                        </div>

                            There's no ante in Hold-em, there are blinds.<br/><br/>Blinds are blind bids that are paid before any cards are dealt. The person to the immediate left of the dealer pays a "small" blind, which is equal to half the the minimum allowable bet at the table. The person to the immediate left of that player pays the "big" blind which is equal to the minimum allowable bet. On many tables, according to the house rules, the minimum allowable bet, and therefore both small and big blinds increase incrementally after consecutive sets of several hands. <br/><br/>So say the  minimum bet at the table is two bucks, and the minimum bet doubles every ten rounds of play:<br/><br/>In rounds 1-10, play goes like this: <br/><br/>1.) The person sitting to the left of the dealer paying out $1. <br/>2.) The person to that players left then pays out $2. <br/>3.) Two cards are dealt face down to all players.<br/>4.) The person to the left of the person on the big blind must either a.) fold out b.) call the big blind's bet (and put in $2) or c.) raise the bet to whatever he wants up to the table's maximum if there is one.<br/>5.) Each other player must then in turn fold out, call or raise the highest bid made in the round. Once all players have called the highest made bet without raising, betting is closed for the round.
<blockquote>Eg. P1 is dealer, P2 is small blind, P3 is big blind, P4 is first to act after the first cards are dealt, P5 is second:
<blockquote>P2 bets small blind $1<br/>P3 bets big blind $2<br/>P1 deals cards.<br/>P4 folds<br/>P5 calls the bet, puts out $2.<br/>P1 raises the bet $1 for a total of  $3 and puts out $3.<br/>P2 calls the bet, puts out $2 (to join the $1 he put in for the small blind)<br/>P3 raises again, $1 and puts $2 in (to match the $2 already wagered with the big blind)<br/>P4 does nothing because he has folded<br/>P5 calls and puts out $2 (to match the previous $2 wagered).<br/>P1 calls and puts out $1 (to match the $3 already wagered)<br/>P2 calls and puts out $1 (to match the $3 already wagered)<br/>Bidding closes and the flop (three cards face up) is dealt.</blockquote></blockquote>
6.) The flop is dealt: three cards face up.<br/>7.) The player to the left of the dealer can do three things: a.) "check" to stay in the game without making a bet, b.) fold out, c.) open with a bet.<br/>8.) The bidding proceeds the same way it did last time, one by one, the players can check/call, fold, or raise, and bidding ends once all players have called the highest made bet without raising. This can mean no bet is placed.
<blockquote>E.g.<br/>P1 deals the flop<br/>P2 checks<br/>P3 checks<br/>P4 does nothing because he folded before the flop.<br/>P5 checks<br/>Bidding is closed. A fourth card (known as "the turn") is dealt face up.</blockquote>
9.) The turn is dealt, face up.<br/>10.) A new round of bidding ensues exactly the same as last time. one by one, the players can check/call, fold, or raise, and bidding ends once all players have called the highest made bet without raising. <br/>11.) The fifth card, also known as "the river" is dealt, face up.<br/>12.) One final round of bidding occurs exactly the same as they went before.<br/>13.) Players show thier two cards and the person that can make the best five card hand between their personal cards and the five face up cards on the table, wins.<br/><br/>If there are two players, and P1 makes a bet of a $1000, and P2 only has $500, P2 can go all in. He puts everything he is into the pot. If he loses, P1 gets his money and he's out of the game. If he wins, he wins $500 of P1's $1000 plus anything that was previously put into the pot.<br/><br/>If there are three players and P1 bets $1000, P2 calls with his own $1000 and P3 only has $500 and goes all in, then $500 of P1's hand, $500 from P2's hand and the $500 of P3's hand all go into the main pot, and the remaining $500 from P1 and the remaining $500 from P2 go into a side pot which only they can earn from. So if P1 wins, he takes both pots, if P2 wins, he takes both pots, but if P3 wins, he can only take the main pot. P1 or P2 will win the side pot, as determined by the better hand between the two of them.<br/><br/>But, this is just Texas Hold'Em. The number of rounds of betting really depends on the kind of poker you're playing. Generally, rounds of betting will occur after any deal of new cards, or draw (exchanging cards in your hand out with the dealer). So that means some games will have a single round of betting and some will have much more. I've seen as many as six rounds of betting in a single hand.                        </div>

                            If you're not a poker player, it's easy to get lost in "who bets what, and when."<br/><br/>But for the purposes of adapting poker-style betting to other systems, I'd say that the important thing to understand is that the <i>point</i> of each round of betting is to (a) figure how how much the player who wants to bet the most is willing to bet that he will eventually win the hand, and then (b) figure out which of the other players are also willing to be that amount, on the chance that whey will win instead.<br/><br/>The rest, basically, is procedure.                        </div>

                            While Texas Hold-em is the game du jour, I am of the opinion that it's a crappy way to learn how to play Poker. I think that Poker should be taught as Three Card Draw, ala Hoyle, also know as "Straight Poker." Once people have that down, I think that learning variations like Texas Hold-em and such become much easier... rather all variations become easier. Learning how to play most games if you start with Texas Hold-em is much harder.<br/>
<br/>
Could just be because that's how I was taught...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some things displayed above, but not elucidated include:<br/>
In the last round of betting (and only the last), if all players have chosen to see the bet or fold, and the player to your left is the one that last raised (or the only one to bet), you have three options at that point:<br/>
- Fold<br/>
- Raise<br/>
- Call<br/>
<br/>
A fold is functionally equivalent to a call here, except you lose and do not show cards (raising, of course, continues the process). Calling* here is important, becuse it ends betting, and has an effect on who gets to see what cards. Basically the player called can fold, but in practice his hand can be looked at by any player. Interestingly, if it turns out that the folded hand is looked at by the winner, and it's the best hand in this case, it wins. So it's a question of whether or not you want to risk the loss for the information gained by looking at the cards if you're the winner.<br/>
<br/>
A non-winning player can look, and this does not change the outcome of the hand. That said, independent dealers can revoke this privilege if they feel it's being abused. In friendly games, usually the called player shows his cards perfunctorily, to avoid just this seeming abuse. But it's not usually by rule.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody else has to show their cards. Going around to the left, each player has the option to do so, but generally only does so if they have a better hand than all that have been displayed before them. They must show the better hand in order to win. Other players may instead fold. They may even, theoretically, choose to do this if they have a currently winning hand. Perhaps because they feel certain that a hand to their right must be better than what they have. Or just to throw a pot for some strategic or personal reason.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if you get caught bluffing, and you have a very poor hand, even if it's ten high to beat a 8 high for the player to your right, you may want to fold under the assumption that some player to your left has a better hand. Just so that nobody sees that you were bluffing such a crazy bad hand.<br/>
<br/>
Generally the reason not to show your hand is because it tells players just how often you bluff, and with what sorts of cards. Even if you have a good hand, but not a winning hand, showing it tells the other players that you did not bluff, which gives them valuable information for future hands.<br/>
<br/>
So, if possible, you want to be the player to call, as you'll have the last hand to show, get to see the called hand, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Some house rules allow players to buy the right to see a folded hand from the player in question. Sometimes for flat rate, other times for negotiated price.<br/>
<br/>
[*The term Call technically simply means to see. But in most colloquial uses it means seeing to end the round.]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cards shown to another player can be demanded to be seen by all other players. It's not fair for the one player to have the advantage of knowing what cards are out there. People often ignore this rule. Cards shown to a player who is not in the pot don't have to be shown to all during play, but must be shown to all players after the pot has been won. Again, even this little bit of info is valuable, and sharing with one and not others is cheating.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another concept not mentioned is check-betting (or just checking), which is generally allowed with the exception of certain specific games that require bets. A check-bet means betting nothing, essentially. If the entire table checks, then the first player to check is called (if it's the last round, otherwise it just ends the round of betting).<br/>

                            Just a couple things:<br><br>1) Particularly in game design, folks will talk about "poker auction" (for example, <a href="http://boredgamegeeks.blogspot.com/2006/02/anatomy-of-game-blue-moon.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://boredgamegeeks.blogspot.com/2006/02/anatomy-of-game-blue-moon.html</a>) which isn't quite the same as this.  The basic idea is that it's a standard auction system, but <i>all</i> bids are paid, not just the winning one.  It's an interesting mechanic.  I think Amber character creation uses it.<br><br>2) Very occasionally, texas hold'em will employ antes in addition to blinds.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Roger                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Mo covered it thoroughly.<br><br>I think Hold 'Em is a great way to learn *good* poker, but it does require a lot of folding and more strict starting hand requirements.

Something like Omaha or "straight" poker has more action and might be a better starter, as Mike says.<br><br>One thing about betting at the table in a casino: "String" raises are a big no-no. As in, "I see your 5... and raise you 10." We learned that from the old westerns but its not cool in a real game. The proper ettiquette is to simply say, "Raise," and then follow that with the amount you're raising ("fifty") or the total bet ("to one-fifty total").<br><br>- John<br>(whose state decided that online poker for money was illegal and is now in poker withdrawal)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Mike, that thing about showing your cards in friendly games after you fold may just be regional.

Not as far as I know.  Once everyone has bid the same amount, the game moves on the the next step.                        </div>

                            Heh, funny, Mo and John have completely opposite opinions what the games in question do. I personally wasn't speaking to the excitement of the game, nor how technical it is, but merely that all Poker is some variant of five-card draw, so learning it as the base makes learning other variants less difficult. You can then describe any Poker game by how it varies from straight poker, instead of describing the entire game from scratch. Stud Poker being sorta the exception, and Seven Card Stud being the second form I'd teach.<br/>
<br/>
From there you go on to things like Five Card stud with three common cards - AKA Texas Hold 'Em. I'd hate to have to try to explain straight poker from a basis of Texas Hold 'Em. "See, instead of three common cards, you all get five cards, and make the best hand from that, putting down up to three cards between two rounds of betting, and getting replacements." See how much easier it is to work from the ground up?<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah, if you're never going to do another game, then fine, teach the one you like. But the fun of Poker Night is, to me, the dealer getting to call the game being played. How else are you ever going to get Twi-Night Doubleheaders? Black Mariah? Indian? Between the Sheets (which will end up with check books being pulled out)?<br/>
<br/>
I'd hate to miss all of those. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the rule I'm quoting on showing cards, I think I'm being misread. Only the person "called" (meaning that the betting has stopped with the player to his right on the last round) has to show his cards, and that's only on request. That person rarely, rarely, rarely has any incentive to fold at that point (he'd have to have been grossly bluffing, and really sure of the other players), so normally you see those cards anyhow. And it's even rarer for somebody to ask to see those cards if they do. So it's a little known rule.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody else ever has to show their cards, and, yes, it's usually not a good idea. But I've seen the top players even do it sometimes, just to intimidate lesser players (pointing out that they bought a pot). Is it assholish? A little everywhere, but I think that's pretty regional. In any case, that's a social thing, and not a firm rule.<br/>
<br/>
Of course local rules always apply. Any attempt to create a "universal" rule on Poker is doomed. I'm just quoting from the rule-books used in most of the big tournaments and such. It's interesting that Poker is so complex a game that, in making it about gambling, that even things as simple as "movements toward the pot" have rules about them for tournaments and such.<br/>
<br/>
Lesson? Try to be sure about house rules, and read the rules published for a tournament. They may be slightly different than what you're used to. Actually with house rules, there are some huge potential variations. For instance, it's always shocking to find out that "round the corner" straights are allowed (K-A-2-3-4, for example). Or, lesser, that Aces can be use as high or low, or (rarely) that Aces are low. This sort of variation should always be announced to newcomers, but occasionally this gets forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
For using Poker in a game design, simply be sure that you specify this sort of thing. Players will probably house rule it (what would be more natural than house ruling a RPG with Poker rules!), but at least there's a standard from which to work.<br/>

                            My own game 'Mob Justice' uses a poker based system. I totally agree with Mike's last post in that you need to be specific about how you are using poker in your game. Are aces high are low for instance? In most poker variants aces are high, but I went for low in Mob Justice as it made the mechanics work better.

                            The idea I had was just to use the betting system with a twist in the cards. The game would have a total of four different decks. The two main ones would be an event deck and an action deck. Each card in the action deck would have five actions, which may or may not have anything to do with the current event. Each of those five actions would be ranked 1 to 5. If a player holds an action card with an action linked to the current event as a 1, they would win, etc... Tokens are bet using poker betting rules. But it's just floating around in my head. I suppose now, I've disqualified myself from using this system in Game Chef 2007. Maybe not.                        </div>

                            To admit my hypocrisy, I created a 24 hour game design called "Stakes" in which you really just play Poker. The chips represent parts of the character, and you narrate what the character is betting from himself when you bet. But the play is then simply poker.<br/>
<br/>
And when it came to describing how to play poker I skipped it, and just assumed people know how. Because, well, I only had 24 hours in which to make the game. :-)<br/>

                            Oh one other thing occured to me. you have to take probabilities into account. Mob Justice uses one deck per player and so the probability of drawing a particular hand remains constant from conflict to conflict. However if you were to only use one deck for all players to draw from then things like who draws first would become important. As the cards are depleted ceratin hands would become impossible to get. Just something else to think about.<br><br>Bryan, are these four decks traditional decks? Could you go into how tokens tie into the cards and why you have decided that poker should be your game model?<br><br>All the best<br>Iain                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            No, I don't think the four decks would be traditional. I'm just floating the idea right now, so they sure could be. Tokens won allow a player to move his character around a board, towards winning. It's all just a really rough idea that I don't want to work too much on until I see what Game Chef is going to offer and see if this idea will work, but I figured that I should figure out poker betting before I went further with the idea. <br><br>Right now, I'm sort of thinking Uno, Bullshit, and Poker all rolled up in one with a boardgame like Life on the side and rpg characters wrapping the whole thing.<br><br>I really need not to think about making other games until my current one is finished.                        </br></br></br></br></div>
