After reading through the pre-order pdf, though, I've got several questions for anyone who's played or might simply understand the text better. Bear with me, these might get a bit wordy, but I'm looking for some discussion.<br/><br/>What happens when the Operation Plan goes off the rails? It seems to me that the idea is that the players come up with a pretty structured plan, and assign bonus dice gathered during Analysis, but what happens if some essential part of the plan falls through due to failed rolls? Does the plan get restructured and dice rearranged? What about smaller hiccups, when a back up plan on the side can help get the original plan back on track? Can dice be reassigned so that those actions have a bonus?<br/><br/>Similarly, in the stress charts, the ability to add stress to a professional relationship by borrowing or taking dice from someone's pool is mentioned, but I'm not clear on what that means. Does that mean that you can rearrange the dice assigned to different steps of the plan, at the cost of stress?<br/><br/>I also think that I'm a little confused about how Push Pyramid opportunities are incorporated into the Analysis/Operation/Blowback structure, but here's how I think it works: You can use any unlocked space on the Push Pyramid as an Opportunity (i.e. the result of a failed roll) once per job for each time a relationship was increased or decreased during the Blowback phase of the last job. I was initially confused because the text says "It's a series of Opportunities that The Agency takes between jobs," which seemed to mean that these things happened outside of jobs, but that didn't make much sense. Once I realized that "Opportunity" was capitalized, my current interpretation occurred to me. Does it sound about right?<br/><br/>One last thing (for now!): Civilians seem like they won't come up much. It seems like their main use is getting a little boost here and there, achieving parts of analysis or the operation plan without having to use your own limited number of rolls. Is there something else? I like the idea of non-super-spies being incorporated into the story, and especially the relationship structure... but I'm not really sure how to bring them into play, either as a player or The Agency.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279960/#Comment_279960" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T05:12:36+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  5:12AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My question is - will it be available on IPR?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279964/#Comment_279964" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T06:12:14+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  6:12AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2010 6:20AM by Elizabeth.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chris!<br/><br/>Things are supposed to go off the rails in Operation, to some degree. As the text says, Operation rarely, if ever, goes as planned. Here are some tactics the game gives you:<br/><br/>- The Opportunities on page 47. When a roll is failed, The Agency has a list of Opportunities they can take, sort of like Moves in Apocalypse World. Failure at the given task is only one of many Opportunities to choose from.<br/>- On page 25, it explains how a team member can sacrifice one of their prep dice to abort their part of the Operation, or warn a team member that their plan has changed. <br/>- On page 28, it talks about how already-existing prep\u2014 even The Agency's prep\u2014 can be leveraged as bonuses for the team. <br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD! The stuff about moving dice is from an older version of the rules. My bad. You don't move prep dice around, because prep dice are for preparation, pure and simple. If you didn't prepare, you have to improvise. You still get to roll your skill. Prep dice, especially in the beginning of the game, will let you STEAMROLL over The Agency sometimes. The team is still pretty competitive without them.<br/><br/><br/>Push pyramid: You were right both times. You can take one of the Push Opportunities whenever you want; you pick them out between Jobs. I've opened Analysis with a Push Opportunity, thrown one at the team in the middle of Operation, and ended a session on one as a cliffhanger. Pick out your Push, hang onto it, and use it when the opening makes sense.<br/><br/><br/>Civilians: Civilians are the heart and soul of the game. During one-shots, there's always someone who decides to play their Civilian exclusively. The Civilians' importance emerges naturally from the fiction: they are really the only people with ties into the community. Their big strengths are in their roots in the area and in their distance from the spy life: when the Professionals don't have a way in, or don't know the area, that's what Civilians are for. When people the team are protecting need a place to stay? Civilians. When the <i>team</i> needs a safehouse they know isn't bugged? Civilians. I don't know what else to say, except once you play a game it'll make sense.<br/><br/>As far as bringing them into play as The Agency, there are some tips in the book. When I'm The Agency, I tend to introduce new Clients through Civilians, and remind Civilians of their normal life's obligations whenever it makes sense to do so. In reality, though, some Civilians will just get used more often than others\u2014 and that's fine and to be expected. The biggest tip I can give you as The Agency is to set up jobs with your Civilians in your sights: have the client be a work friend, or make it clear that the Operation is going down at a charity a Civilian fundraises for, or the like. In reality, though, I bet your players incorporate their Civilians more than you're expecting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279965/#Comment_279965" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T06:16:21+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  6:16AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, the PDF will definitely be available on IPR once I figure out whether I'm going to sell it as-is or make a printer-friendly version.

Okay, I see that preparation dice represent preparation for particular events and plans, so once they are set, you are <i>not</i> prepared for other things. What happens in a case where The Agency chooses failure for a key part of a mission? If, for example, the operation plan relies on the team being able to steal something before it gets moved, and then there is a massive failure; now the thing is gone and the rest of the mission relying on them having that thing goes up in smoke. Do they just have to finish the rest of the mission without prep dice? It seems that this could also be a problem with spending dice to abort a part of the operation; it doesn't indicate that the step was failed exactly, but if the team can't go back and finish that step, what happens to the other prep <i>based</i> on that step?<br/><br/>I guess I'm just unclear on what happens if the plan has to change. It seems like a part of the source material, the plan goes wrong so the team has to form a new plan. I'm just not sure what happens in Blowback. If you need to go back to Analysis or create a new Operation, I suppose you could go through Blowback and just start from the beginning, but that seems kind of extreme. Maybe. I dunno, I've not played yet.<br/><br/>Sorry if this seems sort of rambling.

No problem, you're not rambling. Let me see if I can explain things a bit more clearly.<br/><br/>Mechanically speaking: if that's what The Agency does, and there's no way you can do any of the stuff you prepped for, then you don't get to use any prep dice. If you abort a part of the Operation, you don't get Momentum from that prep, but you still get your prep dice for the following parts of the plan. Do you want to talk your way through Operation with me as an example? You set up your prep, I'll be The Agency, and I can show you how it works and explain what I'm doing.<br/><br/>If the plan goes wrong and you're in the field, then you do need to come up with a new plan. But, like with the source material, you have a plan but you're going by the seat of your pants. You lay all the groundwork you possibly can, and then you throw it all out the window if you have to. If you need to get the hell out, go to Blowback, and then do Analysis again\u2014 that's a rarity, but it's an option.<br/><br/>The main problem in the scenario you posit isn't the rules though, it's The Agency. On page 46, this advice is basically the crux of The Agency's job: "Most of the time, if not all of the time, the characters will basically achieve what they\u2019re trying to achieve\u2014 like with gathering information during Analysis, it\u2019s your job to create complications, or make them achieve their goal at a cost." Your job as The Agency isn't just to screw them over in such a way that the game breaks down or people stop having fun. The whole reason that "failure" is one of many choices on the menu is precisely to prevent the scenario you're talking about. I didn't spell out "Always choose the option which will be the most fun," but I think that's generally good GM advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279989/#Comment_279989" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T13:24:04+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  1:24PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I'm getting a better idea of the flexibility of the operation plan and how the bonus dice are assigned.

They do what they set out to do\u2014 otherwise the movie or TV show is frustrating or boring\u2014 but the tension comes from the ways in which they <i>almost</i> fail, or what success costs them. \n<blockquote><br/>I think I've been mentally comparing things to Wilderness of Mirrors and Mouse Guard, both of which put the GM in a more adversarial role, but that's not really the point of The Agency from what I can tell.<br/></blockquote>\nI've never read either Wilderness of Mirrors or Mouse Guard, but basically. I was playing a ton of Apocalypse World with the WMass crew while I was working on Blowback, and there are some obvious influences there. A big difference, though, is that not every NPC is a threat. When Operation goes down, mechanically speaking, it becomes this adversarial one-on-one sort of contest between The Agency and the team\u2014 but that doesn't mean The Agency is out to screw the team as hard as he can. It's about testing the waters: how far can I push this? If I make her choose between the Client and her boyfriend, what will she choose? When will his mom tell him to stop bringing home people on the run from organized crime? What is she willing to do to impress her brother?\n<blockquote><br/>Thanks again for the discussion.

Later in the Blowback section it says that your nerves are shot if your number of rolls is GREATER THAN your skill. Is that supposed to be "equal to" or have I missed a trick to let you keep rolling?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283939/#Comment_283939" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T17:21:45+00:00" title="August  1, 2010  5:21PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a typo!

(This makes sense, ultimately. This also means that Momentum tends towards zeroing out.)<br/><br/>* During Operation, "aborting" a prepared action (at the cost of losing a die) means that you can use the remainder of those prep dice for a related improvised action, if it makes sense.<br/><br/>* Stress vs Relationships: When you due things on the stress chart, you accrue points of stress. When the stress on a relationship is greater than or equal to the Relationship level, it's broken until you relieve stress. (A broken relationship means when someone asks you for something you're likely be like "GO AWAY".)<br/><br/>Things I misunderstood:<br/><br/>* It's always more helpful to add more dice! You succeed if you get *any* successes (not by comparing successes to failures).<br/><br/>* In a long-term game, each player plays both a Professional and a Civilian. (In a one-shot, where a player might focus on only playing a Civilian, I found that the GM needed to nudge/engage that Civilian to keep them integral to the plot, but YMMV.)<br/><br/>* The "Agency" section is a real section! It's a whole separate chunk of neat rules, and not a "GM Advice" section! Read it. Duh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
