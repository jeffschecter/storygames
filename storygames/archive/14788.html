That seems forced.<br/><br/>Do the characters participate in the same conversation?

I don't think there was any conscious design to it, but we generally split up the spotlight by-player, not by-character -- in one case, the first character was already a bit of a hermit, which was part of what motivated the advance in the first place, and made it very easy to switch focus to stuff involving the new character. In the second case, the player's second character was specifically connected to a somewhat isolated social community that the other PCs (and particularly his first PC) were at odds with, so it was very easy again to keep the characters relatively separate. There were probably a few sessions where the player essentially only played one of their PCs, but this was never a conscious 'switch on, switch off' setup.<br/><br/>I don't think we ever had a scene or situation where both characters were in the same scene/talking to each other/etc. Because of the fictional situations of the PCs this didn't require any particular effort on my part, but I doubt I would ever have purposefully framed both the players' PCs into the same scene unless the fiction (or the players) demanded it -- whereas of course we were all happy to invent reasons for other PCs to run into each other, etc.<br/><br/>But of course the answer there is, as it always is: <i>funny voices.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336304/#Comment_336304" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T17:14:43+00:00" title="July 28, 2011  5:14PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When Alex put together a second character in our AW game, I took his share of spotlight time out of Matthew's allotment.

Another player has retired his character and started a new one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure how it is from their perspective, but I'm usually trying to think about which player has been sitting around or a while and get them in the next scene with one character or another.  I'm not always the best at this.  It's also good to have as many PC's as you can in the same scene.  And I do try to follow the fiction as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an unacknowledged strategy for the two players who have two characters of never having both characters in the same room.  I mean I don't think they think about it too much (maybe they do), but it seems to work out that way most of the time.  So I can't say I've seen the problem of "which of your guys is talking."<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the 2 character players made her new character with a sort of a personal mission to kill her old one.  So far that confrontation has been avoided, and if it does happen I'm not sure how it will play out.  Of course I thought she was going to retire the old character but she just switched  the original character's playbook.  Really cool, but not what I think we were expecting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the weird things that's happened to me personally is that the player who retired his character and got a new one?  His old character is retired to safety but is still around as the angel for the hold.  Which means I've had to play him from time to time.  There's something really weird about playing somebody else's guy (even though he's mine now, except I'm not allowed to fuck him up or make him evil or anything.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336345/#Comment_336345" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-29T02:43:27+00:00" title="July 29, 2011  2:43AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2011 2:44AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Retiring your Angel PC to safety and having them stay in the hold to provide medical services?

Living in different places, associating with different NPCs, all that. But it worked so that we never had that old "2 PCs in one scene, 1 PC in another" split.<br/><br/>My 1st character and Andrew's 1st character were total buddies and hung out lots.<br/><br/>Adam's 1st character started to shun them and went his own way. Then he met Andrew's 2nd character and they had a frenemy thing going on.<br/><br/>When Adam's 2nd character showed up, he had some hijinks with my 1st and Andrew's 1st characters (the buddies). Then he teamed up with my 2nd character and they worked together on a mission of sorts.<br/><br/>And voila! No more scenes with only 1 player and the MC, and no scenes with both of one player's characters (I mean, the whole point of a new character for us was to play someone completely different and interact with NPCs who wouldn't give our 1st PCs the time of day). And that's where it was when we stopped playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336422/#Comment_336422" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-29T16:18:46+00:00" title="July 29, 2011  4:18PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jackson: Just because all the current PCs are in a convoy doesn't mean all the new PCs have to be in the same convoy.
