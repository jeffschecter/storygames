I think games with serious subject matter like this can be a hard sell, but they are really, really worthwhile.<br/><br/><b>Hero's Banner</b>. This is a good game, and again, it's had some indie scene buzz, but that isn't reflected in its sales. The structure, with its tightly constrained story arc and short character lifetime, might put some folks off, but this is another game that hits its theme with a sledgehammer.</blockquote>\nNow, rather than clutter up that thread, i decided to start another one, because i want to know more about these games. Both of them are games i passed on, but now i'm wondering if i was mistaken. Specifically, war movies do nothing for me. But anti-war movies can be great. In general, war as a setting doesn't really interest me, but i can "put up with" it, if it's in service of a message other than glorification of war, or the goodness of necessary war. Heck, Full Metal Jacket is one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>[No, i'm not claiming my positions are inherently right, or perfectly consistent; just that either of those comes up, and it hits a hot button. I believe that war is sometimes necessary; i just don't think that necessity makes of something a virtue--it can be both necessary, and wrong/evil/sinful/pick-your-term. IMHO. I really don't want to debate this position in this thread--this isn't the place for it, for starters. I'm just letting you know where i'm coming from.]<br/><br/>So, it probably won't surprise you that i never even looked at Carry. I see "game about war", and my eyes glaze over. Why do i want this game, anyway, if i generally find war boring as a topic/setting? And, to answer the obvious, i *do* like the idea of addressing serious topics in RPGs, as well as discussions. <br/><br/>On to Hero's Banner. This one, again, i don't know much about. It looked interesting to me at a quick flip-through, so i asked the author to 'splain it a bit. However, he managed to explain it in such a way that, the more he said, the less interested i became--i don't think he could've done a more effective job of un-selling me on the game. Unfortunately, i don't remember what he said, now. So pretty much the extent of my knowledge is the above-quoted post, and what Fred Hicks said on the Game Master Show podcast. And, based on both of those (people whose opinions i've found often are close to mine), i'm beginning to suspect i dismissed it too quickly.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87526/#Comment_87526" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T11:21:07+00:00" title="August 11, 2007 11:21AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts on this:<br/><br/>I think you could play a game of carry that glorified and reveled in war if you tried really, really hard.

As a game about war, it's really more about (as many Vietnam stories tend to be) a game about what war does to the people who fight them. But really, my absolute favorite part about carry is it's ability to organically and powerfully build a scene that begins with a bit of tension and eventually explodes with all sorts of unforeseen consequences. More games should take this tension building lesson away from carry because it's powerful in a way that doesn't seem at all contrived.  For an example I suggest browsing our actual play thread over at the Forge: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23387.0" rel="nofollow">Round One</a> and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23434.0" rel="nofollow">Round Two</a>.</p>\n<p>On Hero's Banner, I won't even attempt a sales pitch.

How violent it is, is also up to the players and GM, entirely. Generally, there should be some conflict with rival nations and their nobles, but it could be entirely intrigue and political squabbles.<br/><br/>The game is about making choices.  Your character stats are entirely defined by three life paths they can make, centered on a heroic ideal, family duty, and love.  Any of those, the first two in particular, can involve violence, but don't have to.  Furthermore, resolving conflict is pretty open ended - what actions are taken are left to either the player or GM to decide.  It just has to fit into a narrative.  Your stats don't dictate whether you are good with a sword or not, simply how much emotion and energy you have invested in each of the three paths at a given time.<br/><br/>Even if a war is underway, how many soldiers kill how many other soldiers isn't important to the story.  It's about what the characters do and the decisions they make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88097/#Comment_88097" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T18:43:23+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  6:43PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just an FYI you can expect actual play reviews for both of these game just after GenCon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93859/#Comment_93859" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T15:57:37+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  3:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, based on this info, i took a look at <i>carry</i> at Gen Con, and picked up a copy.

Over the course of the past year I've simply realized the extent to which my demo sells Hero's Banner better than anything else I've ever done, including, ironically, the book itself.  Nevertheless, that makes me feel good because I know the game itself works -- or at least the core of it does.  Now I'm just exploring whether or not the text of the game, for instance, is hindering non-demo sales.  I'm thinking that there are lots of people that haven't played the demo, and/or have apprehensions about actually running the game, and that by supplementing the text I can better get those people jazzed about the game.<br/><br/>Now, before I'm accused of hijacking any threads, go play carry!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95032/#Comment_95032" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T09:00:03+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  9:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 9:01AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just had to add that when I described my experience with Carry to somebody, I called it "The Full Metal Jacket RPG." :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that Nathan cites that movie, but feels that Platoon is even more appropriately the main source.
