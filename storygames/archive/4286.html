Most of them are people you've played with yourself; one or two groups are people you've never met. By now, the rules are working; they're smooth and fun. There's a bit of buzz around, people you know are talking about the game, and you're starting to feel the excitement: This is a good one. You've started thinking about layout and cover image, and are polishing the text one more time before it's time to fire up Scribus, or InDesign, or OpenOffice or Word or whatever you're using for DTP. Time to send your baby out into the world.<br/><br/>Stop right there. You're about to make a mistake. If your baby's going out there to face the wolves, it needs someone to train it first. And you're not that person. <br/><br/>What you need is someone you <i>don't know</i>, who <i>doesn't</i> know your game yet, and who's read and written game text before. Your game, right now, is understandable to you, your friends, and a few people you know. They know how you play, they know what the game's supposed to run like. They hardly even need the text. You're about to get strangers to pay money for that text. If you don't let someone else run through the text first, asking tough questions and making you rewrite the entire thing once or twice - the strangers who paid for your game will not be very happy.<br/><br/>If you <i>do</i>, however, get an editor - you will be raising the bar for indie games. Your game will be able to reach a much wider audience. You will learn a lot about writing, and do things very differently the next time. And the strangers who buy your game will know what to do with it. They'll understand your baby.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96468/#Comment_96468" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T02:41:44+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  2:41AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2007 2:43AM by Matthijs.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bleh.

How much should an editor expect to get paid? How much is reasonable?

If this is where you're at, it's not quite time to find an editor or worry about layout. The game, as described above, is simply "alpha" tested. That is, it's been internally tested.<br/><br/>But this is the point where you need "beta" testing. You need external testing, either in the form of an ashcan or some downloadable "playtest draft". The alpha phase gives a false sense of security, because it works for you, and maybe for a couple of people you don't know. It becomes really, really tempting to head straight for production. But you need feedback from ALOT of people you don't know. Different people think differently, and you need to know how to address their varying questions.<br/><br/>This was the lesson I learned from tMW. The game "worked" pretty much from the start. But some people didn't "get" what I was trying to do. It was that process of answering their questions through the beta phase that built the text. I think many people think that good mechanics is all you need. I actually believe a good text is as important, if not more important, than the mechanics.<br/><br/>I didn't mean to threadjack, but we all saw the results of inadequate playtesting in some of the more recent games. After you go through the beta phase, that's when the time for an editor and all that becomes important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97460/#Comment_97460" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T05:33:41+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  5:33AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: #FF0000;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ALOT</span></span><br/><br/>a lot                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97461/#Comment_97461" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T05:40:48+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  5:40AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2007 6:07AM by Matthijs.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (EDIT: This was in response to Graham's question).<br/><br/>I'm not sure. Given the strange economy of the market, I'm not sure exactly what is worth paying for, in the sense that quality != earnings. You might end up with the clearest and most understandable text in existence, and get <i>less</i> buzz for it: A lot of online questions and debates over games are based on unclear rules.<br/><br/>So you're not necessarily paying for something that makes money. Having someone edit your text will, however, make your product better in terms of quality. My English is okay; my Norwegian is excellent; when I write books, they're edited by professional editors, and after editing and rewrites, the texts are very different - and much better. <br/><br/>Using your friends is okay, but not optimal, in the sense that - as I mentioned earlier - many of them share your background (gaming and otherwise), and are likely to miss the same spots you're missing. In addition, friends will often not be able to see your text as separate from you. I've seen several published indie games that have been read by friends of the publisher, but are still a mess. <br/><br/>Personally, I haven't charged anything yet. I'm not a professional, and this isn't primarily something I do for money. However, I would need to charge something for my services to make sure that the publisher is dedicated to actually following up, and will consider my feedback seriously. I've played, designed and helped design games for long enough that I'm wary of doing things for free for people without a few finished projects in their past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97464/#Comment_97464" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T06:09:58+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  6:09AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>Wait, Wait, WAIT!...

Even if you don't get a professional editor, get someone who is pretty decent with the English language to look it over and mark misspellings and grammatical errors.  I picked up quite a few books at Gen Con this year, and while I'm not going to name names (unless people really want me to) there were a few games with texts FILLED with typos.<br/>Now, as people have pointed out, to a certain extent this might not matter.  Having clear, clean text may not make you  more money.  The game that is in my mind most prominently as I write this I still consider to be a very cool game and I'm really looking forward to playing it... but good gods the typos annoyed the hell out of me as I read it.  I seriously wanted to get out a red pen and start correcting things.  Strangely, some of the typos appeared to possibly be the result of whacking the spell check button and letting the word processor change whatever it wanted with no human oversight.  That's a bad plan people.<br/><br/>I'd offer my own services as and editor or proofreader... but frankly I'm good enough at procrastinating my personal projects and homework already, so I'd either not be giving someone's game text the time and effort it deserves, or I'd not be giving my own work the attention it needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LG" title="LG"><img alt="LG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LG">LG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97637/#Comment_97637" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T16:37:48+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  4:37PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is possible to edit your own games (I edited Beast Hunters) but it's not easy. It's especially tough if you're rushing your game into print to have it ready for something like GenCon. The only way to spot the typos and errors your eye's been skipping over for the past five revisions is to put the text away and let it rest for a while. That's a good idea anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nTypos and grammatical errors are distracting. Poor organization keeps players from understanding a game as well as they could. Those issues will probably be reflected by game reviews.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham, costs are definitely an issue. Editing self-published projects is not going to pay me as well as other types of editing. I can't charge as much, because I know how much it costs to publish a game and how hard it is to do it independently. If you pay an editor or proofreader, it will take you longer to recoup your investment, but from a financial standpoint, if we want indie games to be professional-looking and marketable, the copy needs to be as clean as possible. If you don't want to pay for thorough copy editing, you might consider making your text as clean as possible and then paying for proofreading before you send it to the printer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97638/#Comment_97638" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T16:44:18+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  4:44PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: LG</cite>It is possible to edit your own games (I edited Beast Hunters) but it's not easy.</blockquote>\nLisa, how much easier do you think it was for Beast Hunters, given that it was a joint project?
