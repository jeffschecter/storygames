It's a play session with my regular gaming group (The Damned Dirty Apes), three dudes in their twenties and thirties who are still newbies even though I've been gaming with two of them for about six years now. The session we're playing is called National Insecurity, and it's one of the two scenarios from the core rulebook, so there are spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The material has been edited from a four-hour game session into a pair of twenty-minute segments.<br/><br/>It's my first podcast, and I have no clue what I'm doing, so any and all feedback would be deeply appreciated! Thanks!<br/><br/>-- Rafael<br/><br/><a href="http://www.pupuplatters.com/pupuplayer/free/pupuplayer.php?podcast=http://www.bigcontact.com/dreadcast/rss" rel="nofollow" target="blank"> <img alt="image" src="http://www.pupuplatters.com/pupuplayer/buttons/button1.gif" style="border: 0px;"/></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
