Games like Dogs in the Vineyard, Sorcerer and My Life with Master all fall flat without a strong central GM pushing situation through strong NPC agendas.  But there's a part of me that actually disagrees with this because sometimes those of us who play these games forget just how much story organization GMs often do.<br/><br/>The most obvious is social conflict.  Any game without social conflict resolution will come down to someone's fiat.  If two PCs are arguing it will simply come down to which Player fatigues first (the real human).  And often this is lauded as "good hard successful roleplaying" because clearly the player who caved was simply out argued in character.  This goes doubly so for a GM who wants a particular argument between PC and NPC to go a certain way.  And Hell, sometimes PC to PC social conflict is resolved by GM fiat and often through subterfuge like having a particularly significant NPC step in on the side of the PC he wants to see win the conflict.<br/><br/>Less obvious so is the GMs ability in most games to simply state what is and is not possible.  For example, say the PCs walk into a house just in time to see a man pocket something and run out the door.  The PCs say they want to give chase!  With Golden Rule style games it's perfectly legal and even expected for the GM to say, "No, he's just too fast for you."<br/><br/>This can't happen in Dogs in the Vineyard.  If the PCs want to give chase and call for a conflict and state their goal as "We catch the guy" and they win, then they catch the guy.  The GM just has to deal.  Which I can see as frustrating for GMs who like to use such scenes as "set up" for another scene which gets utterly destroyed if the guy doesn't get away.<br/><br/>So on the one hand, yeah a lot of "Story Games" require strong GMs that feel like "GMing as always" but at the same time these games do eliminate "Magician Force" tactics that many GMs use without even being conscious of it.  And so yes, in that they remove such techniques from the GM they DO remove power from the GM.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100227/#Comment_100227" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T11:51:41+00:00" title="October  1, 2007 11:51AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ru Baraba Dom</cite>Perhaps the motivation isn't (always) to take power from a gm, but for the gm to give away power and become player.</blockquote>\nThat's sort of my take in reverse.

I just want to say that pretty much my only positive Trad gaming experiences have been with GMs who don't pull any Rule Zero bullshit, but just follow the rules of the game as stated in the text, with any houserules laid out clearly before they come up.  Do they still get to "say what happens" somewhat more often than in most Indie games?  Sure, when the rules don't have anything to say one way or the other.  But in actual practice, what hurts my fun when playing Trad games is as much GM Fiat / Rule Zero as the rules themselves.  I'm perfectly happy hopping on the dungeon-crawl railroad from time to time, so long as it's consensual\xe2\u20ac\u201dthat is, clear from the get-go that there is a Plot We Must Follow (TM).<br/><br/>So, Indie games take away a meta-rule which gives GMs powers, and a meta-rule which I happen to think is really harmful.

Often as not, it's about spreading the workload. I quite understand why someone would find the role of GM unfun, and designing GM-less games is a reasonable response. OTOH, there are player preferences that can't currently be met without someone in that role. Of course, there's no reason why Ben and Shreyas should address the needs of that player group. It's always sensible to design for people who share your preferences, I think. But I'm still interested in how those players can be catered for, while avoiding problems such as burnout, which can happen even with GMs like me who rather enjoy the whole thing, workload and all.<br/><br/>I also think that if people are interested in persuading more traditional gamers to give SG-type games a try, this approach will be more persuasive to most of them than talking about issues of power, or broken player roles. But that's not of interest to everyone, I know. It's not a great concern of mine, for starters!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100390/#Comment_100390" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T05:36:40+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  5:36AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But I'm still interested in how those players can be catered for, while avoiding problems such as burnout, which can happen even with GMs like me who rather enjoy the whole thing, workload and all.</blockquote>\n<br/>Caterers get paid.

However, I think it's utter nonsense and diverts conversation from fruitful results. (Hi, Malcolm!)<br/><br/>When I wrote that "Interactive Toolkit" for White Wolf Magazine back in '94, I brought up the same ideas we're talking about now, and I can guarantee you concerns about "power struggles" (as some folks on RPG.net and theangryRPGsite like to babble on about on occasion) were not on my mind at all.  Nor was it a matter of "re-distributing" power in some sort of Marxist, revolutionary fable.<br/><br/>It was about having everyone participate more in the making stuff up part of the game -- which always seemed to me to be where a lot of the fun of RPGs lies.  It was also about letting everyone get stuff on the table that mattered to them.  That might be defined as a power issue, but I can guarantee everyone it's not how I saw it, it wasn't the principle framing of the matter for me.<br/><br/>The principle framing was <i>adding more stuff to the game that you thought was cool or interesting to share it with your fellow players</i>.<br/><br/>Some people around the Internet have taken a few conversations in theory-talk that about re-distribution of narrative authority and ran with it, like a flag that says Power Struggle -- as if all this work people have been doing for years has always been a fight about taking power away from the GM.  It's isn't.  It wasn't.  It has always, in my view at least, been about letting everyone at the table PLAY more.<br/><br/>Now, I understand some people don't want to Play More.  Some people want the GM to carry these burdens so they don't have to add anything to the game in public view. Got it.  And although this whole thing might sound snarky, all I can say is, "Good!"  I want them to play what they want to play, and I don't want them suffering through games they're not liking and writing lonely missives to Malcolm by candlelight when the other players have gone away where they reveal their frustrations with having to play in ways they don't like.<br/><br/>All I can say is, I want to play with the Players who want to add more.  It's not just a matter of the game mechanics, it's a matter of the temperament of the Players.  And in ever fun game I've had over the last few years, I've NEVER once sensed that a "Power Struggle" between the Players and GM  was in any way -- at all -- an issue for the Players or the GM.<br/><br/>What I often do see is <i>conversations</i> by everyone at the table as we openly and like creative, cooperative human beings, sort out imaginative elements at the table.  (This is a spike in the heart of another common bugaboo I see crawling around the Internet: "Those Story Gamers don't know how to cooperate!  It's always about a Power Struggle with them that the have to have the rules adjudicate!"  Um... No.  We talk just fine.  And cooperate all the time.  Thanks.)<br/><br/>Again, there are Issues of "power" involved, of course.  If someone suggests something at the table that strikes the wrong note for the group at my table (and the GM might be the one to do this) there will be a discussion that resolves the issue, the key for me has never been an issue of Power.  It's always been more creative input from everyone and everyone feeling as if they could bring up ideas and fictional elements that turned them on so they could share them with their friends and make more soup out of the things they cared about.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100414/#Comment_100414" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T07:58:19+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  7:58AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Honestly, I don't think the responsibility is at all illusory, at least in a traditional set up.</blockquote> Well, I don't mean to imply that the GM has *no* responsibility for the group's fun. That would be silly.<br/><br/>But as a GM, you can't force anyone to have fun. And having responsibility for something without the power to control it is a classic recipe for stress. I think over-emphasis on the GM's responsibility can be pretty toxic. <br/><br/>And I agree that never-ending campaigns can make things worse. I just tend to think that that's turning up the dial, rather than the source of the problem, if you see what I mean.<br/><br/>Andy: yeah, that sounds familiar.

I GM all the time, because the other people won't but also because I like it. I enjoy the world building and the plot writing, and the rules design, and I enjoy entertaining other people. Some of my players, in contrast, want to be entertained. They don't like taking the limelight so much, they don't enjoy the world building, they *like* being given stories and settings to play in.<br/><br/>And of course I let them help whenever I can. They take responsibility for certain bits of the game, they suggest ideas and we incorporate them, but they don't appear to want to take over that role or even share it equally.

The difference between short run and long run is a bit analogous to the difference between a novel and a short story.  A bad novel is more horrible to endure than a bad short story, but you can do different things with two forms.  Things that might be acceptable in a short run might be unacceptable in a longer run, and vice-versa.  Anyway.  Mud in the water.<br/><br/>Back to the role of the gm: I think any game role can be done poorly, and I don't think that it's the fault of the system.  If you have a bad gm, you have a bad gm.  It is true that trad systems are vulnerable to this abuse.  I guess you can deal with this in one of three ways: endure it, vote with your feet, or change the system.  I don't think I'm entirely on board with story-games yet, but I've only seen them in one-shots, and one-shots don't do it for me (trad or story-game, doesn't matter), so I'm not yet sure if I feel like option three is a viable option for me.  (And sentences probably shouldn't have 4 independent clauses).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100515/#Comment_100515" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T12:59:59+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 12:59PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2007 1:02PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, nobody said being the entertainer is bad, if that's what you want. Everybody here has said that they don't want to be the entertainer, so games requiring them to be so aren't to their taste. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we created Universalis, we had, as a goal of the design, giving players the power to create the setting. Over time we found less and less reason to have a GM, and the position faded from the design.  The last version of the GM was called "First Player." And we only had that, because we were assuming that you had to have some such role in a RPG. Eventually even that went away, as we found tools to give to the players to do everything we'd assigned to that position. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn't eliminate it intentionally, or as some design goal. We just couldn't think of any reason to keep the role, for the rules we had written. It has nothing to do with "power," and everything to do with what made sense for the game that we'd created. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. so called "Story-games," heck I'd go so far as to even say Narrativism as a movement, have come about, in my opinion, largely due to the existence of GM's who never really wanted to be in sole control of the game, and wanted to play themselves. That is, we didn't want to give up the tools we had as GMs, but we also didn't want to have to "perform," but, rather, get to participate the way the players participate. So it's no surprise that we ended up with games that facilitate this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100572/#Comment_100572" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T16:41:41+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  4:41PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>P.S. so called "Story-games," heck I'd go so far as to even say Narrativism as a movement, have come about, in my opinion, largely due to the existence of GM's who never really wanted to be in sole control of the game, and wanted to play themselves.

From peoples' statements here, it sounds like a lot of the drives also stems from having groups where only one person is willing to GM.  <br/><br/>I've almost never had that.  In my experience, typically around half the group are willing to GM.  I also love the creativity involved in being a traditional player -- breathing life into a character and coming up with unexpected directions.  That's one of the attractions of larps to me -- that they vastly reduce the amount of typical GM stuff.  There are generally no NPCs, and few impersonal events and narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100574/#Comment_100574" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T16:47:20+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  4:47PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>From peoples' statements here, it sounds like a lot of the drives also stems from having groups where only one person is willing to GM.<br/><br/>I've almost never had that. </blockquote>\nI've had that.

I've run successful traditional games for a long time now - mostly at conventions. I like being the entertainer, writing my own stuff for others to enjoy, and the other traditional GM roles. I've recently switched to indie games as much as I can. Rather than take away anything that I enjoyed doing as a GM, the indie games give me more to work with. It can be tough coming up with new ideas for the world, NPCs, etc - especially when you've been doing that for many years. With players making a lot of it, I can grab on to stuff and run with it and tailor it to what they really want. I think this makes the GM role better. And the players naturally respect the GM's role more and are less likely to try to "break" the scenario.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100591/#Comment_100591" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T17:31:52+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  5:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite>Rather than take away anything that I enjoyed doing as a GM, the indie games give me more to work with.</blockquote>\nThere ya' go.<br/><br/>That's what I thought 13 years ago.

When we first picked up Universalis and gave it a spin it was a palpable relief for me to not be responsible for the game and to finally play.  That's obviously in line with what you're saying here.  But the flip side of the coin is that my players suddenly felt empowered to GM -- so it wasn't just me that was craving a change in roles, but everyone at the table was refreshed by the distribution of authority (avoiding "power" here -- I *have* experienced power struggles in RPGs but they mostly derive from people who are regular GMs adopting a player's role in a trad game with an inexperienced GM used to a player's role) and by the implication that the expected distribution of authority was actually mutable.<br/><br/>After we put aside Universalis for a while we found that even our more or less traditional gaming was infected -- players wanted to GM and GMs wanted player input.  Regardless of system.  Rules like "say yes or roll" and "let it ride" became de facto house rules in everything we play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100624/#Comment_100624" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T23:11:04+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 11:11PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might add a point of view, and hopefully I'm not the only one who feels this way:<br/>\n<br/>\nGMing in a traditional RPG setup can be a lot of fun. In many ways, it can be more fun than being a player. If I had the choice, I would take GMing over playing most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there is a dark side. For me, it was the combination of Hard Work and No Recognition. Specifically, it sucks if you put a lot of work into something, and the players are clearly not into it. Indie games were tantalizing to me because they offered the promise of making sure that the players would be into whatever was happening, whether because they "flagged" it or because they created it in the first place. That's what brought me here, despite the fact that I love GMing traditional RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The problems and frustrations of being a _player_ in a traditional RPG, on the other hand, are, I think, familiar to everyone.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul T.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100626/#Comment_100626" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T23:46:01+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 11:46PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Are you saying NO games are fun when you're the GM?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>No, I'm saying that <em>I have no fun when I am GMing</em> with the exception of one game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100647/#Comment_100647" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T05:31:29+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  5:31AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally agree with you Paul, I almost always prefer the GM role to the player one, and that isn't about power its about enjoying all the things that go with GM'ing.<br/><br/>Mike, apologies,I didn't mean to mis-represent what other people were saying.

Certainly there are people who are claiming to like it. I do, in fact, just far, far less than I like more distributed authority. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a far more pervasive problem than GMing being onerous is that where the person who is the GM never gets to play. Often in a group there's one person who's willing to do it, and one alone, and that person gets stuck being GM whether or not they want to. And even if they want to, they might also want to be a player sometimes (like John and Ben, and I do). So we're not pooh-pooing GMing, so much as creating games where the forever-GM problem can't rear it's head. Er, like Ben said. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat wasn't intentional with Universalis (as I explain above), but it is a welcome side-effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you play with groups where the GMing rotates, or where there are multiple games going at once with multiple GMs, etc, then you might not be sensitive to our plight.

It can be a lot of work -- though in my experience, GMs often seem to make more work for themselves, such as by creating their own original setting, NPCs, adventures, and even rules systems.  By comparison, it seems like a lot of work to me to design one's own rule system from scratch, especially to the point of making it publishable.  Yet there are clearly people who don't like the work of GMing who <i>do</i> like the work of game design.  <br/><br/>I also enjoy many GMless games, though, so I don't think that this depends on disliking or find a problem with GMing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100769/#Comment_100769" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T10:49:13+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 10:49AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way to phrase my experience is this: Traditional GMing typically gives me more scene time/influence/responsibility than I want; traditional playing gives me less scene time/influence/responsibility than I want.

It's good to break up your assumptions.  GMless games are great for this.  So is doing a game without dice, for example, and a game without NPCs, and a game without combat.

While traditional RPGs conspicuously lack rules saying "you should be incorporating the player's ideas in the game" they tend also to lack rules saying "The player's ideas must be ignored because the GM is GOD!".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>If you play with groups where the GMing rotates, or where there are multiple games going at once with multiple GMs, etc, then you might not be sensitive to our plight. But that's OK, it's not like there aren't plenty of games with GMs.</blockquote>\nMany groups are like this, of course, but I think a lot of us are in the classic "one GM and some players" mode and still work out fine. Some of us just like being GM's. I like being a player too, but I am usually happy enough to be the GM anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

though surely?</blockquote>\nSure. I fled from the horrors of bad GMing into "running" story games, remember. The preponderence of my gaming activity is GMing, though I find I don't like having quite so much responsibility and want more authority distribution. \n<blockquote>While traditional RPGs conspicuously lack rules saying "you should be incorporating the player's ideas in the game" they tend also to lack rules saying "The player's ideas must be ignored because the GM is GOD!".</blockquote>\nYet it is my experience that traditional games are all too easily abused for structural reasons. 7th Sea, for instance, as a default has Drama Dice awarded at the sole whim of the GM. The bulk of these dice at our old 7th Sea game went to the GM's favorite player. I pointed out these and other problems repeatedly until I got fed up and quit. <br/><br/>Of course it's about bad GMs, and not GMing or trad games being inherently bad. However, I find I get much more mileage out of rules that better suit the playstyle I want. It's a matter of suitability, not superiority. A hammer is great for certain uses, a saw for others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101406/#Comment_101406" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T05:38:31+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  5:38AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>While traditional RPGs conspicuously lack rules saying "you should be incorporating the player's ideas in the game" they tend also to lack rules saying "The player's ideas must be ignored because the GM is GOD!".</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I think you'll find that this is actually a competence issue rather than a rules issue.

I focussed on how they facilitated a certain style of play, without thinking about how they encouraged them for people who might like that style but just not be able to bring themselves to do it without a mechanical shove.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101574/#Comment_101574" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T19:24:34+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  7:24PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "Conservative Games" sounds terrible. And I don't see how it's in anyway descriptive. And it could be seen as placing a value on a category/style of games and I don't think you want to do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know why "Traditional Games" was considered a "clever" term in the past. I only learned and started using the term recently because it's descriptive and gets to the point quickly, not to be clever or make a joke of some kind. So I don't really understand the comment. Generally, everyone knows what is meant by the term when it's used so I've found that it's very effective. Why would you want to leave all that behind because the term isn't "clever" anymore? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's the "Indie" and "Story" games terms that are ill-defined and misunderstood. That's not a critisicm, everything new takes time to understand.
