Surrounded by weird Sumerian artifacts and guzzling their leader's amanita muscaria-laced urine, the cult is growing increasingly paranoid and powerful in the open city of Krakow.  When they begin demanding livestock for oracular sacrifice and the daughter of a prominent Polish war profiteer joins their ranks, local warlords decide enough is enough.  An all-out assault is days away.  But a shadowy American is willing to pay for the recovery of priceless Sumerian treasures, including the fabled Mask of Humbaba, and Janusek Corliss will give anything for the safe return of his daughter...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130439/#Comment_130439" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T05:54:59+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  5:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.. you know what's even more funny?

Ten ventured to slay the Corruptor God, as he had stolen the essence of the land. Only three returned. Now that the god is dead, they pass the Seven Sacred Essences onto you: You must take it, and journey to the great seven natural locations in the world, and disperse a portion of the essence in each corrupted part of the land to restore it to health. Since the land is corrupt, you must deal with bizarre creatures and humans with twisted and corrupted personalities.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Basically, a fantasy version of Dead Inside, where the heroes have to travel the world, giving things to it and healing it. For added drama, make one of the questors one of the Three Left from the battle with the Corruptor God.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130662/#Comment_130662" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T16:48:49+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  4:48PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            okay, so I'm less inspired by the actual story of the god and more by his title, Guardian of the Fortress of Intestines.<br/><br/><b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5</b><br/>The Wizard's Guild needs something, and the something it needs is (as always) hidden away in a dungeon.  So as always, a representative of the Guild is sent down to the local watering hole to round up a group of people crazy and stupid enough to do the Guild's dirty work.  This time it's going to be exceptionally dirty work, because this time the item is hidden in the Fortress of Intestines, which is unfortunately <i>exactly what it sounds like</i>.<br/><br/>The player's are sent through a gate to one of the nastier, more brutal outer planes (I'm thinking The Abyss), where they discover the entrance to the Fortress of Intestines.  which is a giant oozing sphincter.  Pushing their way in, they find themselves in a soft, gooey tunnel of organic matter.  Various parasites cling to the walls, sometimes forming swarms, and leap at the PCs attempting to attach themselves.  As the players push deeper, they find themselves face with more and larger forms of parasites (including giant tape worms and the like), more sphincter doors, and occasional stomach like chambers with swampy, acidic floors.  Eventually they reach the center, where the must face Humbaba and his deadly acidic spray attacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130665/#Comment_130665" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T16:58:24+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  4:58PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where's the Unknown Armies love?  <br/><br/>So when we open the box, inside there's an old, beaten leather bag, like the size of a basketball.  And it stinks.  God it stinks.  I have no idea how whoever sent this thing got UPS to accept it, but there it was anything.  Inside the bag, once Twitches got the thong untied, it was like fish guts from the biggest fish ever.  I mean, if you caught the fish, you'd throw it back just to keep it from beating you down prison-style.  Oh, and it mumbled, and sang to itself.  That was the thing Rose couldn't stand.  Not the stench.  The whole time we had it, Rose just couldn't deal with the weird little grumbly singing.  Of course, that was just the beginning of out problems.  One day after we get this thing, three, count 'em: three, different avatars are all up in our hood, looking for this thing.  One of them was on the path of the Adversary, and Hans thinks another was follow the Forester or something.  I don't even like to think about the psycho who walked up to me in broad daylight smeared head to toe in shit.  In the end we just set them all up: got them all to the same meet.  We figured they'd kill each other, and the survivor would make off with the guts.  Which worked out, pretty much.  If we could just get of the aura of stink all over the safehouse, now, everything would be copasetic.<br/><br/>Until next time, obviously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130670/#Comment_130670" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T17:18:32+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  5:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Mountain Witch</b><br/><br/>The king has lain in his sickbed for three weeks.  His belly is taut like a drum.  He has not passed any food or water in five days.  The Doctor and the Priest both believe his end is near.  The demon Humbaba has the king in his grip.  There is only one hope.  An ancient spell, found on clay tablets, is the last chance of saving the king.  The finest warriors are gathered - sellswords from the edges of the desert, but the finest fighters known in the world.  They are entrusted with the mission.  And then the priest begins the spell.  Blood from ten bulls is spilled.  Twenty geese are burned on a pyre.  The priest takes out his own eye with the ritual knife.  The warriors stand on the dais, where is lain the king.  And then the warriors begin to shrink.  The priest, his eye socket still pulsing blood, lifts them into the sacred vessel, and places them at the gateway to the fortress of intestines.
