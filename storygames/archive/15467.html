I like the way John thinks, a lot. I really do think that there is a great story game merge between these two brilliant creative works. A shared narrative game built around tragedy, on sedorners and bogles, lazhars, skolds, scourges, and any other kinds of terotologists and their nicker antagonists. Of noble intrigue, politicking and revenge....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else thought about this? Anyways, I'm going to jot some notes into my journal and once I get home and cross reference my MBT books I'll post a few concepts on running a HotB game set in the world of the Half Continent.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350750/#Comment_350750" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T02:05:57+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  2:05AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, why on Earth is it called "The Foundling's Tale" in the U.S. and Canada, but still Monster Blood Tattoo elsewhere?
