Here was my reply:<br/><br/>"Would you believe I've been reading about symposia, hetaerae, Aspasia, and Pericles for another project? From what I can tell, a symposium wasn't much like what Jerry has put together. But I actually rather like the game function of his version. How often do adventurers end a mission loaded down with loot and without anything interesting to spend it on? Jerry's symposia would seem to serve the dual purpose of 1) divesting players of their loot by selling them the chance to star in their own The Hangover, and 2) of springboarding the game into new situations and complications for subsequent sessions. Imagine mission based gaming with none of the stop/start between missions."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerry%20D.%20Grayson" title="Jerry D.

The first draft tried to stick close but it was kind of boring and didn\u2019t fit the HELLAS paradigm at all. <br/><br/>The Symposium mini game is there to give the heroes something else to do that isn\u2019t fighting and also give the social characters a chance to be in their element. A lot of adventures can happen at a dinner party and now the players have a structure that they themselves can set up to do it in.<br/><br/>The rules also bookend the drinking rules in the Swords and Sandals supplement                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
