As a group, we're generally pretty much about sharing all the narration and comedy action stuff. We're also all fans of <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>, which heads the inspiration list in the introduction. <br/><br/>As we discussed the starting situation and place, we ended up with the village of Lesser Dorking in rural England. Any actual residents of such a village have our apologies. This setting also meant that our game ended up taking as much from <i>Hot Fuzz</i> as from Shaun. No bad thing as far as we are concerned. We decided to go for a fairly plain Romero-style zombie situation.<br/><br/>Our characters were:\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Wolking (spelling never pinned down), a drifter. Goal: (Power) To take over the village and rule it as his personal fiefdom. Or something.</li>\n<li>The Reverend Ian Mosely, vicar. Goal: (Faith) To convert unbelievers (i.e. non-Anglicans).</li>\n<li>Bill Smith, an American tourist. Goal: (Justice) To hunt down the one-armed man. We never found out what for, exactly</li>\n<li>Sergeant Charles Cruikshank, police officer. Goal: (Truth) To discover the truth about the Pettigrew 'suicide'.</li>\n</ul>\nNow, these goals were not all revealed straight out, but you can see everyone's thoughts were all turning pretty gonzo already.<br/><br/>Our first scene was in the pub, and served to introduce the characters and situation (phones out, storm coming) and we generated a couple of NPCs too. A couple of characters made some initial attempts towards their goal (Bug got the local cops drunk, and Bill found out where the one-armed man was hiding out). I started setting up some hints that bad things were coming, and generally played up the friendly NPCs to get people liking them.<br/><br/>We then went around for a few more scenes, each hinting about things going on that were a little out of the ordinary. The police, drunk, went off to check out the old Pettigrew murder site (he had been found dead with a steel spike through his head in an abandoned graveyard). In order to stress test, Stef (playing Bug) decided to go for his goal in his first scene, taking the village mayor and council hostage. He failed, in the process getting the pretty young woman NPC fully monstered. So our first zombie began eating the hostages and pretty much everyone fled. We continued for two or three more scenes in which people began seeing zombies here and there and realising that things were goin bad. That finished reel one, and I refreshed my dice for reel  two. <br/><br/>We began a series of running from and fighting zombie scenes as everyone gradually homed in on the house where the one-armed man appeared to be doing some kind of dark magic ritual. The Reverend, clearly going nuts, decided to join in biting people with the zombies, despite only being slightly infected at this point. The fight scenes also began taking a toll on our NPCs, many of whom rapidly became infected or zombies. A big zombie fight around the house rounded off reel two and took care of a couple more NPCs (including the heroic bartender Lester and his brother Constable Reggie). The house was also, in the process, set on fire.<br/><br/>Reel three began with the vicar luring a bunch of uninfected towards some zombies - he was by now 2/3 gone. Bug was after revenge on the one-armed man, who had double-crossed him in his 'take over the village' plan. His scene involved getting into the house, past the zombies on the ground floor.<br/><br/>Charles and Bill investigated the abandoned water tower near the Pettigrew death site, and found the abandoned hideout of a zombie hunter from the time of the death. They resolved to finish the job and went back for the one-armed man in the burning house full of (mainly flaming) zombies. Charles messed up his rolls and got fully infected in this conflict. He then turned on Bill who also got zombified. At about this time the vicar finally went all the way over too, although I forget exactly how it happened. <br/><br/>We closed off the game at this point, with just one survivor who was unable to win (as Bug had blown his goal attempt earlier). Our final scenes had Bill shot through the head, the vicar eating people on his altar, and Charles shambling his way through the military cordon. We saw the military cleaning up the area and the CO remarking over the radio that the area was secure and nothing got past the infection. Lastly, Bug got out his map book and selected another village to target for his plans of domination.<br/><br/>Quick impressions: It was a blast, we had a great time and are keen to play again. A few things still seemed rough around the edges, and those are going to follow in more detail. We had a few players trying odd stuff, mainly because it was a playtest, and not all of that worked. However, it was all in the spirit of science (or, at least, trying to break stuff).<br/><br/>Here's what I noted that might need work. I'll ask the rest of the players to add their comments too, if they have anything more to add. Some of this are just queries for Eric, some might be holes, some are just stuff that didn't quite work for us. \n<ul>\n<li>It seemed pretty hard for the PCs to get through all of their 6 tokens to achieve their goals. Is that intended? It's possible we just got too carried away with smacking around zombies, rather than going for goals, but nobody got rid of more than three in that game. At the very least, advice to players should probably emphasize that they need to go for tokens every opportunity they can.</li>\n<li>We had the PCs get infected very rapidly in big fight scenes when multiple PCs were involved. Maybe when you get a 12, you should only infect <b>one</b> player who is eligible, instead of all of them?</li>\n<li>The NPCs seemed to get infected very fast, too - in a couple of cases before there was really a chance to get to know them. This feels intentional, but was a problem. Maybe make sure all NPCs get defined in the first reel when there is much less chance of this occuring?</li>\n<li>The rules don't tell you what to do when more than one person wants the same NPC helping them in a conflict. This came up once - trivially - in our game, but I can see it being a bigger problem when goals are on the line.</li>\n<li>Is the GM allowed to add Infected dice to their pool <b>during</b> a conflict (i.e. when a player chooses to reroll with desperation or craziness)? I'm guessing not, but we had this happen (by popular demand, no less) during one conflict. In hindsight, I should have resisted that call, I think.</li>\n<li>Probably the game should advise players to not <b>try</b> to become infected. As noted above, we had one character doing this. It was fine in the gonzo spirit of this game, but I think it played a little flat. It might be good to optionally support it for players who want to do this, as well - maybe by letting 'gain an infected die' be something you can win in a conflict ("I go up and let them bite me").</li>\n<li>The early goal attempt was a big letdown when it failed, and probably would have been on success too. I think going for your goal should only be allowed in the third reel.</li>\n<li>Why do you start with 6 NPC blanks? This wasn't really an issue in play, but I wonder what the reasoning is. Should it vary for larger groups? We pretty much ran out of non-zombie NPCs in the third reel, which reduced the helping options for the PCs a lot.</li>\n<li>There should be a rules cheat sheet for players. For a no-prep one-off game, having all the crucial rules right in front of you would be a real bonus.</li>\n</ul>\nI hope that's some useful comments for Eric, and that everyone else can see that this is a damn fun game. Hopefully we can try it again with less comedy, more horror, and see if that works just as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72153/#Comment_72153" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T08:01:43+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  8:01AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><ol><li>It seemed pretty hard for the PCs to get through all of their 6 tokens to achieve their goals.

Eric may have changed his mind on certain things. These are my impressions from our last conversations.<br/><br/>1. If it isn't in the text already, I'm sure Eric meant to have it there. You should definitely be hitting on you character goals throughout. Breathers should be rare.<br/>2. I know that Eric is still trying to tweak the Infection rules. They used to be a lot worse (completely predictable results at the end of each reel).<br/>3. But then you won't necessarily be creating NPCs that mean anything to the story, will you? Was there any problem in realizing what would happen with the NPCs when you brought them into conflicts? They don't have to be used in the conflict unless you want them to, even if they're there by narration.<br/>4. I thought there was a rule that if the players couldn't decide, the GM decided (or took the NPC away and put them at odds to both?)<br/>5. I'm not sure I'm familiar with the current rules as to when the GM can bring in Infected dice. It used to be based on how much infection was in the area, last I remember. So, if the argument is spreading the infection, then I'd say yes, bring in new dice if it seems appropriate. Eric?<br/>6. I definitely know that previous playtests where players tried to be become infected either due to their Motivation Cards or simply because they wanted to be badass (what a weird game that was) fell apart.<br/>7. Maybe as advice, but not as a ruling. Someone might want their character to fail so they can focus on that for the rest of the game. Besides, if everyone has to do it at the same time, some of the suspense gets washed away.<br/>8. Also, just to add an idea to Eric - what if NPC cards came out in waves in each reel? Sort of to <i>show</i> a counter balance to your dice? I've also been thinking about NPCs with weight but no cards. Still, that's a later discussion.<br/>9. True dat.<br/><br/>I've emailed Eric. We'll hear from him soon, hopefully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72154/#Comment_72154" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T08:03:20+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  8:03AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Sands</cite>I hope that's some useful comments for Eric, and that everyone else can see that this is a damn fun game.

That feels like it would work. This would probably help with the quick infection too.<br/><br/>Re: Multiple claims on an NPC.<br/><br/>I couldn't find a rule about what to do here. In the case that came up in the game, I (as GM) had the infected NPC turn against both, as that seemed easiest.<br/><br/>Re: GM Infected dice<br/><br/>The ashcan's guidelines here are basically 'use more dice as the film would get scarier, limited by the current reel's maximum'. That only really applies to the choice at the start of a conflict. Having the GM add more infected dice when a player calls for a desperation or craziness roll seems a bit mean - after all the rerolls have some built in bad consequences. Making it harder to win as well just seems a bit much. Anyhow, the GM can always have monsters attack immediately after the conflict if absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>Re: Goals achieved/failed early<br/><br/>Hmm... yes, I suppose that there might be call for early goal resolution. It could be a positive "I want to deal with this thing now, and focus on the monsters after" choice.<br/><br/>One other comment that we had, which I forgot last night, was that it would help if there was a way to help each other more directly. Something as simple as being allowed to pass one of your dice to someone on the same side of a conflict would probably do. We had a few conflicts in which some players wanted to help each other, but had few dice to roll compared to the main players in the conflict. This pretty much relegated them to the sidelines, as the chances of outrolling someone with a handful of 8 to 12 dice is minimal. This is especially the case when, as happened in our game, we had three PCs versus several zombie NPCs. I was rolling a huge handful of dice and they only had a few each.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72215/#Comment_72215" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T14:59:51+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  2:59PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Sands</cite>One other comment that we had, which I forgot last night, was that it would help if there was a way to help each other more directly.

That's the way we were playing at Nerdly ... If three players are against the GM, then the three players look at their two highest dice (meaning, usually, a 12 ...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72216/#Comment_72216" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T15:09:22+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  3:09PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2007 3:15PM by Mike_Sands.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read it as saying you just take the two highest from your own roll, but I may have missed something.

That's lots of good feedback right there.  The most awesome part being that the issues you had were almost identical to the issues we had at the Nerdly games.  Consistantly broken or wobbly rules are so much easier to work on than ones that only fail occationally.<br/><br/>I'd never thought of having a cheat-sheet for the game before now.  But I suppose it sure as heck couldn't hurt.  I'll keep that in mind.<br/><br/>Fresh NPC cards coming out every reel?  Wow.  I'd never even thought of that.  But it might go well with another idea I was toying with: Having different stats on different NPC cards.  I'm imagining something like having different stats for the different NPCs cards that would be available from one reel to the next.  Probably would be worth testing out.<br/><br/>I'm rather unhappy with how PCs get &amp; spread the infection between each other right now.  The 'rolling 12' thing just isn't giving me what I want.  Mark's right, the old system for it was completely lame.  But that doesn't make me any happier with the current system.  It's my biggest thorn right now.  I don't even have anything interesting to suggest trying in it's place.  I'll have to spend some time puzzling it out in the near future.<br/><br/>When more than one player has a claim on an NPC, I expect the GM to settle the matter in the most unfair and arbitrary way he can possibly think of.  Same as with the desperate/crazed thing.  So I totally support your decision to take the NPC from them and use it against both of them.  Good show.  This isn't clear in the rules right now, but it will be in the future.<br/><br/>It's my hope, but not yet my expectation, that some players will go through their chips quickly, while others will never quite get through them.  But yeah, it needs to be crystal clear in the rules that players are expected to drive hard towards their characters' goals.  <br/><br/>After the Nerdly games, it occurred to me that the -1/chip system for Goals was a little over the top.  I mean, there's NO WAY you can win a conflict with a -4 or -5 modifier.  It's just too much of a modifier.  I have an idea for a solution to that.  Four, five, or six tokens yeilds you a -3 modifier, two or three tokens yeilds a -2 modifier, and one token yeilds a -1 modifier.<br/><br/>Back in just a few with some more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72225/#Comment_72225" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T15:59:07+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  3:59PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For infecting PCs - how about that it has to be a conflict goal? And that the person doing the infecting needs to use an infected die? <br/><br/>That means that the GM can go crazy trying to infect people if they want, and players can infect each other if the mood takes them? It also means that people can try and resist a successful infection attack by using desperation/craziness. Probably keeping it limited to as many dice as the current reel (so PCs can still only turn in the final reel) would be best, too. <br/><br/>I think the fresh NPC cards with possibly different numbers would be cool. The reel 2/reel 3 NPCs might also have less lines of numbers, so their usefulness to players goes down quicker.<br/><br/>My copy had your post-nerdly patch with the new penalties for getting your goal, but this wasn't really a concern for us. We only had one full-on goal attempt, as I described.

The way Mark says it is the way I intended the rules to read, but the way you actually played it is an option I want the players to have.  In other words, if you really want your buddy to win the conflict exactly the way he describes it, then pool your dice with his.  But if you kinda want it to turn out your way, which happens to maybe be similar to his way, then roll your dice on your own, as if you're in conflict with him.  That option will become important if you're both trying to resolve your goals at the same time.  (I'll make sure to be a lot more clear about this in future versions of the rules)<br/><br/>I've been thinking of tweaking the rules (on account of the occationally large dice pools) to allow one to roll over 12.  Like, add up the two higest dice.  Then, if you have more than two 6s, add 1 for each additional 6.  Making three sixes equal 13, four sixes equal 14, five sixes equal 15, etc.  I'm not sure if that would be more complexity than awesomeness though.<br/><br/>I'm so glad that you had someone try to ally with the infection.  That happened with an earlier playtest, as Mark said, and it just didn't work out.  The issue, I feel, can probably be found in how the infection is spread and how likely it is that you'll get that third infected die.  I don't really want to tell players that they shouldn't want to become infected.  I want players to be sorely tempted to become intentionally infected, and then eventually regret that decision.  Unfortunately the rules don't support that desire right now.  But, I'm pretty sure that if I can find a satisfactory solution to that, then we'll have the solution to games that fall flat because PCs are gonzo.  (Did that make sense?)<br/><br/>Whew!  So that's my big brain-dump for the evening.  <br/><br/>I'm so glad that you enjoyed the game Mike.  In the next week or so I'll work out some form of addendum to the ashcan document for you and everyone else who has a copy.  I'll see if I can't address everything that was bumpy during your session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72227/#Comment_72227" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T16:15:26+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  4:15PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>My copy had your post-nerdly patch with the new penalties for getting your goal, but this wasn't really a concern for us.

Maybe 4 or 5. Basically, we had three players get turned in the first big fight scene of the third reel. We could have played some more with the one still-human character, but he'd already missed his goal and his only remaining character requirement was for the final scene (picking the next village to take over). If we had more time left, I would have played out his escape from the village, but we were running towards the end of the evening so it seemed good to stop at this point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72240/#Comment_72240" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T17:37:33+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  5:37PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Additional - here are comments emailed from one of my players (Bill the tourist, in this case). Most of these points I have kind of covered already, and I think the biggest thing is our misreading of cooperation. Still, I figure the original may be useful for further revision:\n<blockquote>If you want to win a roll, you have to risk the NPCs.  If you don't use at least 1, you aren't going to win anything.  In a contested roll, you need at least 4 dice to have any hope at all.  While that is easy to do with 1 NPC early on, you end up using all of them later.  That means that they are likely to become infected, and then monsterized.<br/><br/>The game, in a purely cooperative way, would (after a couple of play attempts) end up looking like this:<br/><br/>Everyone runs around as a group.  Each scene has a single PC using all of the NPCs.  That gives the PC the maximum number of dice, allowing them to avoid infection, probably into reel 3.  The other PCs are observers during conflicts that aren't in their scene.<br/><br/>However, if you have multiple PCs in a contest (on one side), they very very quickly accrue infection and harm.<br/><br/>I also quickly noticed that a roll of &lt; 10 would pretty much always lose. This makes it sound like you want to choose the number of dice based on how many dice the opposing team is using...  <br/><br/>The probability of rolling &gt;= 10 on 5 dice is .65, on 6, it seems to jump to .75.<br/><br/>Personally, I think it's a solicits a form of play that doesn't quite fit with how I like to see the team work.  I don't mind a bit of competition between players, but I don't really want to be penalized for helping out.<br/><br/>Perhaps we shouldn't have gotten desperate so often?</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72241/#Comment_72241" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T18:02:54+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  6:02PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the answer to becoming Infected is to take it out of the realm of 'always when' or 'if this happens' and make it something like this (this is raw, beat it about with a stick):<br/><br/>Infection<br/>A character can become Infected only when they're Brave or Just Plain Stupid. Brave and Just Plain Stupid are conditions just like Crazed and Desperate are, except they take the NPCs out of the picture. Don't have any NPCs or just don't want to risk them in the conflict? Do something Brave - but be successful. Otherwise you're Infected! However, if you've been Brave but aren't successful, you can risk it all with something Just Plain Stupid. If you're unsuccessful, one of the other PCs is Infected! If you are successful, congratulations! You got what you wanted - unfortunately, you got Infected while doing it. Be sure to keep that hidden from the other characters!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72242/#Comment_72242" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T18:04:15+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  6:04PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alrighty.
