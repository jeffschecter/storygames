As observed in one of the other recent OSR threads, in [i]Traveller[/i] all the blather abouth the Third Imperium and its troubles is really irrelevent to the characters and the scenario-scaled challenges they face. Its a pretty read, but ultimately a waste of resources.<br/><br/>Challenge environments should be modular and manageable, discreet uits tht can be presented to the players as needed without demanding ongoing investment (and in the case of rotating GM's, without impinging on other folks challenge environments).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424438/#Comment_424438" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T08:40:12+00:00" title="November 19, 2013  8:40AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you find any value in having any sort of backstory  injecting the environments or growing as the adventures continue?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424440/#Comment_424440" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T09:05:37+00:00" title="November 19, 2013  9:05AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find value in setting, but it's mostly not the sort of thing trad games understand by it. Rather, an excellent setting is a set of campaign principles: a bold high concept that informs everything that is done. Settings I consider superior include <i>Carcosa</i>, <i>Vornheim</i> (both published by LotFP, and I believe not coincidentally - Jim seems to have a gratifying drive for excellence) and <i>Anomalous Subsurface Environment</i>, to pick the ones that first come to mind. Unlike say Earthdawn (which I've been re-reading recently) these do not concern themselves with word count or being nice reads (Earthdawn is all about nice reads, my fresh conclusion is that it's not particularly intended for playing in), they're all about either high concept or minute situational tools. I especially urge anybody wondering about OSR setting work to check out the first volume of ASE - it's a tour de force in productizing the exact sort of bold setting development that I want and desire from my own D&amp;D campaigning. In something like 20 pages it gives you more functional setting than an entire TSR campaign box manages, and arguably more tools than an entire TSR setting product line.<br/><br/>Listing good modules is difficult because there are so very many good ones in different flavours. Therefore naming names shouldn't be taken to imply that there aren't any number of other works that might as well be named. If you're into well-defined and functional sandboxes, as I am, then <i>Better Than Any Man</i> and <i>Qelong</i> (again from LotFP - it's not that others aren't doing good shit, but Jim's crew has been taking scalps in the OSR scene, if you ask me) are excellent choices. If you're looking for dungeons, then for minimalistic I recommend <i>Dyson's Delve</i> (it's free, note) and <i>Tomb of the Iron God</i>, and for AD&amp;D style I recommend the Expeditious Retreat Press series of OSRIC modules. For megadungeons I'd say that <i>Darkness Beneath</i> is most gratifying for the gonzo grunge, while <i>Castle of the Mad Archmage</i> is the thing for minutely traditional Gygaxian dungeon crawl.<br/><br/>Regarding my own play, we've been doing historical fantasy for the last few years; it's a genre where we get inspired by history, and then see what happens when a zombie apocalypse prevents the Fourth Crusade and the only thing keeping the Mongol hordes at bay is the mythical kingdom of Prester John. This is the sort of genre/setting that works very well with build-as-you-go methodology: we started with basically nothing more than the notion that "goblins" and other such demihumans should merely be primitive ethnic minorities, and a bunch of adventure modules, and then went on from there.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424444/#Comment_424444" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T09:48:36+00:00" title="November 19, 2013  9:48AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2013 10:48AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the OSR Bundle of Holding I picked up continues to provide lovely treasures.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>As one of the guys who wrote <i>Earthdawn</i> I first will take your compliment about it being a nice read. I'll then say I think we <i>did</i> consider it for playing in, but -- like a lot of published settings of the era -- most of the material wasn't well thought for play. Most of these settings -- starting much earlier with <i>Traveller's</i> Third Imperium but growing into the <i>BattleTech</i> universe or <i>Shadowrun</i>, and <i>Earthdawn</i> (FASA excelled at this) -- were sort of big bowls of spaghetti thrown at the GM... "Does this inspire you for an adventure idea? How about this?" (I'm the one who pointed this out about the Third Imperium in the other OSR thread that E.T. Smith mentions upthread.)<br/><br/>I also think I was trying to do things with the Passions and Questors that might or might have had anything to do with the straight up adventure fiction <i>Earthdawn</i> promised. (There's a reason I took to <i>Sorcerer</i> like a duck to water the moment I read it.) In hindsight, I (and, well, all of us) were caught up in a business model that wasn't always about productive <i>play</i>. I was trying to shove ideas that would be one kind of game into another kind of game -- and it got kind of gummy, I think. There might have been ways to make <i>Earthdawn</i> work more in the model of dramatic narrative and dramatic choices we've seen in design since 2000. But that would have meant a new kind of game. And that wasn't even a gleam in our eyes back in 1990. <br/><br/>(Would <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> work well for playing in <i>Earthdawn</i>? Maybe! The Passions are essentially the Angel rules from <i>Sorcerer's Soul</i>. The Horrors would be Immanent Demons from <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>, and so on. The Troll Raiders using rituals of violence and aggression to strengthen themselves all would fit into Lore. My own guess is that most of the stuff I shove into <i>Earthdawn</i> would map really well to S&amp;Sword.)<br/><br/>I'd say the OSR thread I started on this site -- as well as my digging into RPGs of the last decade -- have been about dropping habits I picked up while walking the corridors of FASA, TSR, West End Games, Mayfair, etc. What the publishers needed to make a sale was not always what the players needed -- and it's been some work cracking those habits!<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Eero, I have yet to get <i>Carcosa</i>, and just took a peek at <i>Vornheim</i> last night. Can you break down the "bold high concept" for each?<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>[Edit to add: I hope it's not looking like I'm trying to knock all the work I and others did at that time. Making lovely books that are nice reads is hard work! And I had a blast. (I just had dinner with Jordan Weisman last week.) I learned how to type fast, hit deadlines, and hopefully provided pleasure and grist for the creative mill for Players and GMs. But, ultimately, I think there are better kinds of products to handle the needs of <i>play</i>. I would echo Eero that <i>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</i> is setting a bar in OSR. And so many of the games that have been  produced since 2000 have also done so. <i>Sorcerer</i>, for example (clarity of rules and philosophy aside), gave me in its slim volume a game that could rock the house without another word bought on my part. I look at the really well designed, compact OSR games of late to be in the same successful camp.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424445/#Comment_424445" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T10:04:31+00:00" title="November 19, 2013 10:04AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2013 10:20AM by d.anderson.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The setting for the 0e hack I use is the intersection between the spell and gear lists, encounter and treasure tables, and random dungeons.  All history is bent to the high concept of playability - a ruined magical empire, fractious feudal lords desiring expansion, a unified church that keeps them pointed outward.  Daily civilized life is tedious and boring, and most people are very poor.  Anything that might be found in the dungeon that countermands these elements is either an idiosyncrasy or is re-skinned to fit.<br/><br/>I think a more defined setting is an unnecessary strategic complication, though possibly a lot of fun and easy to do with things like Fronts, Oracles, player buy-in through prior play of Microscope/ Kingdom/ How to Host a Dungeon/ etc.  The real downside is the tendency for the setting to become a focus of play, which I suspect was a factor in the emergence of heavy railroading and illusionism, where balancing the integrity and prominence of the setting against the motivations of the players (primarily, risk management and loot extraction) was otherwise difficult.  Other games are way better for setting-focused play.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424446/#Comment_424446" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T10:26:44+00:00" title="November 19, 2013 10:26AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing that works the best, IME, is a megadungeon or a wilderness area that the players can explore and map, and having stitched the various maps together, use to strategically plan their explorations. It's the DM's prep that is the most continuous, ever-present facet of the game. Individual intrigues and plots and character motivations come and go, and while they're interesting, they're usually not as profitable, and tend to fall by the wayside if the DM doesn't continually prep for them in-between sessions or if PCs die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424448/#Comment_424448" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T10:43:11+00:00" title="November 19, 2013 10:43AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I have yet to get <i>Carcosa</i>, and just took a peek at <i>Vornheim</i> last night.

They torture the humans in order to fuel magic that controls the Lovecraftian alien monster gods. But their civilization fell apart, and the humans are wandering around on the is horribly science fantasy deathtrap planet. Fortunately for them, there are space aliens who crash their ships here and there, and humans can use their ultratech blasters to destroy the Lovecraftian alien monster gods and this free themselves from being terrorized by them.<br/><br/>The book is mostly short descriptions of the hexes on the map. Monster stats and settlements of people and some odd locations. They are all meant as jumping-off points for the DM's imagination, and there is little in the way of plot-stuff or characterization in each one. The "role-playing parts" I guess you could call them, are left up to the DM.<br/><br/>The spells that so many people hate are variations on the "sacrifice a virgin for Satan" trope.<br/><br/><b>Vornheim</b> is a bunch of stuff for running games set in a city.

Let me say that the reason why I return to it is that it is, indeed, a compelling fantasy world, especially if I limit myself to Barsaive. This time around I was reading it idly in consideration of maybe doing something OSR-ish with it, but I have to say that much of the best material (like the nuances of Throalite republicanism and whatnot) would find a counter-intuitive home in a hex-crawl; not impossible, but a bit weird. It's really a setting that I wouldn't mind seeing in a novel, but I find it difficult to relate to it for play. <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> - maybe, that might be the best idea yet! Removing the entrenched assumptions about adventuring parties and replacing with the character/scenario set-up of Sorcerer would do much to open the material to use.<br/><br/>Regarding high concepts, here's <i>Carcosa</i>:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/uploads/images/CarcosaSite.jpg"/><i>The world is a broken, post-apocalyptic place of dinosaurs, primitive tribes, isolated citadels and monasteries of strange beliefs. Carcosa is true home to the monsters of the Mythos, up there in the far Pleiades. In the long-ago past it was a world ruled by the Snakemen, who bred humanity as sacrificial victims for their blood-magics. Now the snakemen are gone, but far too often human sorcerers take their place, or humans prove that they do not need the excuse of magic for their brutality. What's more, humanity is not alone: space aliens have descended upon doomed Carcosa like flies buzzing upon a carcass, competing with whoever dare face them in untangling the legacy of past magi-tech. Brutal sword &amp; planet fantasy with racism, psionics, ray guns, radioactive dust in your throat just because why not.</i><br/><br/>The salient point to note here is that the above is just about as much as Carcosa dedicates to setting as an abstract idea or writing exercise (and what's more dramatic, that's probably more clear than anything found in the book itself, insofar as an overview goes); everything else in the actual source-book is tools, immediately necessary for sandbox campaigning with the above suggested setting. You'll need to specifically note that my description is not exemplary, but rather exhaustive: it's not like <i>Dark Sun</i> where you need to add an unspoken "and of course everything else from the core books as well" at the end of every sentence. The success of Carcosa is that it chooses limited ingredients (Cthulhu mythos, primitive pulp fantasy, space aliens are the three high concept ingredients) and uses them to the utmost; no goblins or animated skeletons or wizards or clerics or kitchen sink in this setting. Admittedly the depiction of the setting is minimalistic to the extreme: it seems that readers who don't grok heavy metal pulp fantasy are often left with a dry and mechanical taste from the relentless assault of monster lists, random encounters and such spreadsheet activity that a sandbox setting consists of in practice.<br/><br/><i>Vornheim</i> is similarly simple in its sales pitch:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/uploads/images/SiteVornheim.jpg"/><i>The city of Vornheim inherits the legendary mien of places like Lankhmar or Sanctuary - it's a big fantasy city with adventure around every corner. However, Vornheim is different, for it is not our Earth upon which it sits, but rather a weird, psychedelic phantasmagoria remindful of Alice's Wonderland, goblin lore and west-coast underground pulp fantasy. The fantasy is light-mooded yet sinister, and down-to-earth concerns are mixed freely with extreme phantasy. The world is a cube riddled with dungeon-holes, every dungeon connects to every other when you go deep enough, the goblin city of Gaxen Kane is inhabited by a species of goblin that walks on the ceilings instead of the floors - that sort of shit, a cornucopia of small ideas of extreme colorfulness. Vornheim itself is a regal central spoke of the setting, a suggested headquarters or simply the milieu of infinite adventure: it is a stark place where city state religious custom has wolves released to roam the streets annually, buildings are connected to each other with bridges (there is droll humour in this, I'm sure), the nobility competes in utter alieness, and a rich cast of picaresque NPCs with their own memorable quirks is right at home.</i><br/><br/>As you can see, Vornheim finds clarity in a different manner from Carcosa: where Carcosa is devoid of color, operating on simple recipes of limited ingredients and relying on the reader to grok the amazingly colorful setting lurking in the subtext, Vornheim is all about catching that whimsical fairy tale tone and mixing it with brutal old school D&amp;D. It is appropriate that where Carcosa-the-book is mostly an endless list of semi-random encounters, Vornheim lives in a bunch of random tables that support the GM in providing the random snippets of local detail around which meandering city adventures may develop. My experience is that Vornheim is makes an impression much more easily than Carcosa upon a reader, but it also relies on the GM to grok the tone all the same; all is in vain if you can't produce that particular flavour of unbridled fantasy at the drop of the hat - the book with its random tables and lists of ideas helps a lot, of course.<br/><br/>What unites both of these examples of good OSR settings is to my mind that they're functionally oriented: neither of these is "just a setting", they both impose very clear operational guidelines upon how to set up your campaign if you're going to play with these ideas. In this regard both have very little setting, mostly consisting of what Forgite theory would term Situation and System. Very like <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, in fact - that features this same reduction in idle fluff and sharp focus on the practical. I am uncertain whether any more Setting than this is even preferable in a rpg; Glorantha, Earthdawn, Planescape and such classics of the art-form make a compelling argument to the opposite direction, certainly...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424464/#Comment_424464" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T18:48:02+00:00" title="November 19, 2013  6:48PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2013 6:48PM by Judd.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, what are you making?

I put stuff in that suits my style of running something, and assume it will be tweaked if one of the other folks I know run, much like I steal and tweak others' material as part of making my own tables.  I am kind of giving myself the starting suggestion for improv; as far as I can tell, OSR DMing is mostly improv riffing on spare but inspiring starting material (once goals and risks are established).<br/><br/>The process is essentially brainstorming and picking through obvious sources - the part of my encounter table that deals with wandering monsters is cherry-picked stuff from various D&amp;D editions and the like.  It feels like what the players expect when they sit down to 'play D&amp;D'.  There are less obvious sources, like something I saw in a movie or a dream I had, but most of that is saved for the dungeon.<br/><br/>There is a slightly different method for the more resource-y lists, but I don't feel confident I can express my principle.

But maybe I'm coming off wrong.  The idea is to avoid needing a realised world with lots of setting coherence so that tossing in wildly different dungeon aesthetics doesn't undermine the practical concern of goal- or challenge-based play.  Rather, I don't emphasize setting, specifically to accomplish that.  As I mentioned above, it looks like an unnecessary complication, a distraction, or at its worst a slippery slope.<br/><br/>Let me use an example.  In the yard outside one of the most recent dungeons, there is a bare, blasted tree with huge white blossoms.  When the characters got closer, the tree was clearly dead and the blossoms were translucent, skull-shaped things.  This had no particular purpose.  It still served several purposes - it reinforced the dungeon's prominent undead themes, the lasting folly of a long-dead sorcerer, the opportunity to mess with a magic tree, a potential time-waster or a potential source of harvested magical materials.  Is there another tree like this we've heard about?  Can we make use of it?  What happened to make it this way?  I just put it there, because it was cool and evocative enough, and not because it was especially appropriate, or tied to the rest of the setting in any way, or because I had some great idea of what to do with it or expect to later - that is the job of the other players, through these kind of questions they ask and actions they take.<br/><br/>To me, that's an important part of my approach to setting and adventure design in this mode.  A principle, for me: Come up with evocative stuff that doesn't completely undermine established elements that your players depend on for their planning, and then let them mess with it.  Long-winded.  I am saying, for me in this mode, don't make a big picture, don't focus on a big picture, don't strive toward a big picture, for the setting, or for the orientation of adventures/ dungeons.  Anything along those lines is the most bare bones, to facilitate adventuring and maybe de-emphasize other styles of play.  For the game I'm running, it's "There was once a great empire, it's fallen into ruin, from the ashes rose these squabbling lords and the church united.  You have signed a charter that lets you keep the bulk of your treasure when you return to civilization with loot."  Most everything else is in the lists and tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424539/#Comment_424539" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T23:49:53+00:00" title="November 20, 2013 11:49PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I think d.anderson, you were replying to me, when I used the words "drill down."<br/><br/>I think (I <i>think</i>) you meant that to mean, "Write out lots of detailed things." If that's what you meant, here's my reply:<br/><br/>Drilling down to me only meant what Eero said: <i><b>"Rather, an excellent setting is a set of campaign principles: a bold high concept that informs everything that is done."</b></i> Drilling down means swirling the creative/color ideas in my head and seeing if I cane distill a "bold high concept." That doesn't mean building out lots of details. It means knowing what I'll be building the details from as I build out during play and prep between play.<br/><br/>Or, as James Raggi wrote on the first page of the Referee Book for <i>Lamentations of the Flaming Princess</i>: <i><b>"The only important thing is to have an ethic behind your decisions, an overarching idea, and not just randomly squirm around in your running of a game."</b></i><br/><br/>I am fairly certain, as is the case so often on the Internet, that last five people who have posted are in agreement even though it seems to some we are not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424544/#Comment_424544" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T00:55:31+00:00" title="November 21, 2013 12:55AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks for the recommends!

You can also can some of the content to fit your style without much of an issue.<br/><br/>I remember the old James Bond RPG from Victory Games. There were many modules based on the films, but yet they had subtle changes. Players looking to run through the numbers often got an unexpected surprise.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424545/#Comment_424545" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T00:55:33+00:00" title="November 21, 2013 12:55AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds awesome!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424551/#Comment_424551" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T07:19:36+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  7:19AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2013 7:20AM by d.anderson.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Christopher">@Christopher</a>: You are no doubt correct.
