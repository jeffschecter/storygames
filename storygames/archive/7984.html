Brennen said as much, I just missed it. Thank you both!<br/><br/>And, since you're both musicians, I should add these tactics really work for music, too. Here are two exercises that work really well--maybe someone can find a game analogy for one or both:<br/><br/>1. Consciously TRY to write something that is bad. You'll get something accomplished, and chances are it'll actually turn into something good once you're done--at the very least, you'll be surprised by how hard it is for you to write something terrible. Realizing how hard <i>that</i> is will probably encourage you to write more in general<br/><br/>2. Make yourself write on a regular basis, without worrying about quality. A friend of mine used to write one song/tune <i>per day</i>. Most of them sucked, but the ratio of good ones was surprisingly high: a fellow who had considered himself a terrible composer, incapable of writing at all, found himself cranking out four to six great compositions a month, to his own great disbelief.<br/><br/><i>edited for grammar</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176520/#Comment_176520" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T04:01:20+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  4:01AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I too have a copy, and used it to success in National Novel Writing Month.

It's also about how to get past that inner critic, and is aimed at all types of artists, even those who need to tap creativity in stereotypically non-creative areas (like corporate office work).  I haven't read the NaNo book, but it sounds like it's focused on NaNo and not creativity in general - although I'm sure the principles are broadly applicable. The Artist's Way is explicity written to be broadly applicable.  The Artist's Way is definitely applicable to gaming if you have a hard time feeling creative, or doing prep work if necessary, or feel blocked.  It could help get past barriers to create characters, setting and plot for your next massive campaign or feel more comfortable improving in Jeepform, and all points in between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176590/#Comment_176590" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T12:38:26+00:00" title="October 28, 2008 12:38PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is also largely the thrust of <i>Writing Down the Bones</i>, by the by.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176595/#Comment_176595" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T12:52:20+00:00" title="October 28, 2008 12:52PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like "Writing Down the Bones."
