Time to balance out all this yang energy with a little yin. To whit:<br/><br/>What brought the awesome, but was, to your knowledge, overlooked?<br/><br/>Don't point out that indie games are a very small market, and thus all count as sleepers. This is not clever; you will be viewed with disdain.<br/><br/>Did anybody see a game over at Simply Fun called <b>Handy</b>? It's sort of like Twister for your fingers. Two players turn over cards each indicating a finger. Then they have to support styrofoam balls between their hands, each using the indicated finger. Then flip more cards and repeat. Simple, but highly novel. I thought it would make a cool mechanic for a game about trust and betrayal.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89505/#Comment_89505" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T11:03:54+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 11:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think all of the following are awesome and need more attention:<br/>\n<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22giger+counter%22+jonathan" rel="nofollow">Giger Counter</a><br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22matt+wilson%22+galactic" rel="nofollow">Galactic</a><br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Shooting+the+Moon%22+emily+care+boss" rel="nofollow">Shooting the Moon</a><br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Sign+in+Stranger%22+emily+care+boss" rel="nofollow">Sign in Stranger</a><br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Heart+of+the+Rose%22+emily+care+boss" rel="nofollow">Heart of the Rose</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89506/#Comment_89506" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T11:04:02+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 11:04AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I not only saw Handy, I saw James Brown, Dave, and a number of folks involved in a game of it in the Embassy Suites lobby.

It means something that was really good, but that wasn't commercially successful. In film, these are sometimes called critical success. It also sometimes gets used to mean something that was really good, but had such a tiny print run that almost nobody has seen it.

It was a hit at the Ashcan Front, and Jeff was my "MVP" for the booth with his courteous, helpful salesmanship of not only his game but others as well.</blockquote>\nAw thanks for mentioning <a href="http://www.sonsofkryos.com/giantsrpg.html" rel="nofollow">Giants</a> Matt.  I had a great time and it was so easy for me to pimp everyones game because their games were so cool.<br/><br/>I wanted to mention Kingdom of Nothing by Jeff Himmelman.  It's a cool dark game that reminds me so much of <i>the Fisher King</i>, if you gave Robin Williams character a cool power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
