The video took me a day to film and prepare. Before we go on, I'd like to float the disclaimer: If you want professional advice, talk to someone else. I'm working off an obsolete university education and I'm certain things have gotten tighter and easier since I was working in media production.<br/><br/>It's mostly planning and a couple of inside tricks.<br/><br/>The first thing you need is a <b>time limit</b>. Demos get dull after a minute. A time limit will tighten up the delivery in every way, from setup to editing.<br/><br/>In planning, use any means necessary to <b>avoid actors</b>. Bad acting and/or direction cheapens your work. The best way to avoid it is to occlude actors from the piece. Once you've planned the video, draw a <b>storyboard </b>of the shots required. If you're doing a short demo piece, I think you should keep the number of <b>camera angles</b> down. That is, shoot the whole thing from just a couple of angles. It will be easier to edit and it might read better.<br/><br/>Assuming you have your plan, you know which shots to shoot and in which order to shoot them, now it's time to set up the rig. You can use any kind of <b>digital camera</b>. Since you're going to upload this bad boy to YouTube, it doesn't matter about the quality (as long as it shoots in 640 x 480). You <b>must use a tripod</b>. You'll also want at least <b>three mobile light sources</b>. I used three lamps. Don't point these directly into the shot. That is, avoid pointing them into shot in such a way as to create shadow. Instead, bounce the light off white surfaces (like a wall or a sheet of paper). This creates <b>diffuse lighting</b>. Yum.<br/><br/>Don't forget to check your <b>white balance</b>. And close the blinds. You don't want a change in exterior lighting to affect the lighting in your shot.<br/><br/>Film each shot in turn, making sure to <b>buffer </b>the beginning of the shot with around 5 seconds of inactivity. This will help you in the editing stage. I always put my hand over the lens, start shooting, take my hand away and count to five. Then I can get to the action. When I've finished the action, I count to five and put my hand over the lens again. Buffer.<br/><br/>Now, get your media onto a PC and edit the bastard. I use an old copy of Adobe <b>Premiere </b>6.0 from my student days. When you're editing and you don't know when to cut to the next shot, <b>err on the side of brevity</b>. That is, start late and finish early. I export this fella as an AVI and use it to help me plan the audio.<br/><br/>In the HfL video, I wrote up the voice over assuming around <b>three words per second</b>. I recorded it all and edited it in <b>Audacity </b>Beta, imported that back into Premiere, and chopped and synch'd it until I was happy. During this stage I was able to trim away some of the fatty shots, to keep it tight. A note on the voice over thing: don't fuck with your own voice too much in post production. Make sure you're in a quiet location and that you speak as quickly and as clearly as you can. Imagine you were reading a news broadcast. Be careful, you might end up sounding like a potato.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274984/#Comment_274984" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T09:47:31+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  9:47AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2010 9:56AM by Sebastian.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More Post Production:<br/><br/>For the HfL demo, I imported the AVI into an old, old version of Adobe <b>After Effects</b>. Again, this was something I had lying around from my days in university. I think that there are probably some new age open source alternatives, but I'm not sure how to use them.<br/><br/>Immediately, I <b>fixed the levels</b> by applying an adjustment layer. This brightened up the video considerably.<br/><br/>To create that fade-in/fade-out effect, I created a <b>spline shape as a Mask layer</b>. Err, how do I explain that? I drew an ellipse to match the shape of the circle in the shot, and told After Effects to darken everything outside of that area. I then animated that darkening effect to coincide with the audio.<br/><br/>At last, I exported the whole thing as an AVI, used<b> CamStudio</b> to convert it to an SWF at half resolution and then uploaded it to YouTube.<br/><br/>Easy peasy. Does that help, at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274990/#Comment_274990" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T10:23:27+00:00" title="June  8, 2010 10:23AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy shit.

I also have a small tripod. The whole thing gets shot and then I upload the bits into the very bad software that ships with every Windows box and I edit it down.<br/><br/>The take-away, I guess, is that anybody can shoot and edit video with whatever nonsense they have lying around. If you want to do it, I don't think even amateur work will hurt your credibility and it might be helpful to someone. It is certainly an interesting value-add at this point.<br/><br/>"Avoid actors" - maybe this means "Avoid people pretending to care". But you, talking about a thing you love enthusiastically, or actually explaining a cool thing, that is infectious and wonderful, even if (like Graham) you are socially inept and unsettling to look at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274996/#Comment_274996" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T12:16:39+00:00" title="June  8, 2010 12:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But you, talking about a thing you love enthusiastically, or actually explaining a cool thing, that is infectious and wonderful</blockquote>\nI'm going to be contraversial and say, "no it's not."<br/><br/>I mean, yes, it totally is, when you're face-to-face. In fact, any time it's candid, it works.<br/><br/>Therein lies the problem. If you're talking about your own game (and recording it in your studio with the rig that is very consciously staring at you with a big black lens), unless someone else is directing it and it's cleverly edited, I think it's very likely to come off awkward, contrived or dishonest. I think that video presentation is best left to the professionals. There's a whole bunch of stuff that people do naturally that looks shit on camera. Like moving too quickly, shifting weight, fidgeting, etc. Let alone all the problems of capturing the audio right, lighting the subject and getting the script to sound genuine (unless you want to improvise, which is probably the easiest way to pull it off). THere's a lot that can go wrong, even if you get everythign else right. I would seriously push for newbies (including myself) to drop the cast for the first couple of films. If you cannot deliver a tight, one minute demo without an actor, you probably won't be able to do the same with one.<br/><br/>That being said, some people are naturally charismatic on screen. Chances are, if you're that kind of person, you know it, and you're already writing your next demo screenplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275013/#Comment_275013" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T14:57:04+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  2:57PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently put a video together for one of my classes, and if you're on a Mac, iMovie is stupidly easy to use, especially to do things like animate transitions and add captions.

Like a presenter for a TV show. I now see that this sentence is very ambiguous. (I didn't mean that only professionals should create videos, but that if you want to create a video with a presenter talking to the camera, you should be careful.) I'm saying that you have a better chance of producing something slick if you trim away all the bits that are difficult to control. One of the most difficult things to control for new directors are the cast. That's my opinion.<br/><br/>Joe Mcdaldno illustrated my point much better than I have done.<br/><br/>I think every game designer could have created a video that would have helped me to understand the system better. I wish they had.\n<blockquote>I think you can make an interesting video by pointing a camera at yourself and talking about something interesting for a minute.</blockquote>Yes, this is an exception to my opinion. Diary cams somehow work. It is something to do with digestion. We've seen a billion hours of cutting edge, high production documentary presentation on the news, etc. Anything that mimics that format is asking for easy criticism. But with diary cams, the low-res, intimate format over-exposed by reality TV and YouTube, we've got a greater tolerance for straight-to-camera footage.<br/><br/>I guess a happy medium would be a diary-cam with cuts to some nice graphics. You could even use that funky web presentation software, <a href="http://prezi.com/" rel="nofollow">Prezi</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275098/#Comment_275098" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T04:19:49+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  4:19AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, OK, I misunderstood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275100/#Comment_275100" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T05:06:10+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  5:06AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been trying to get Pelgrane to make GUMSHOE videos with Ken Hite and Robin Laws.

I've seen at least one vid produced by a small publisher in which they use pan and zoom on art from their product accompanied by an attempt at a portentous-sounding voiceover. It actually came across as rather naff; largely because the person didn't have the right voice for portensity - and the swooping artwork went on too long. I think something that addresses the viewer on a more personal level would be a much safer bet - ie even if it turns out a bit amateurish it's unlikely to go horribly wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
