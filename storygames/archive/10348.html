Each turn, you get a new hand of cards from your deck, and they give you things that you can do to draw new cards from draw piles into your deck.  Most of the 'things you can do' are things like: draw more cards from your deck into your hand, add new cards from draw piles into your deck, play more cards.  Very simple building blocks, very complex results.  It is a fantastic, lean, brilliant engine for play.<br/><br/>How do we rip off this fantastic engine for story gaming?<br/><br/>One thought:<br/><br/>Instead of buying victory point cards and totaling them up at the end, you can buy damage cards and apply them to badguys (or call them resolution cards and apply them to conflicts).  You can also buy, say, weapon cards that allow you to buy larger damage cards (and think TSoY here, with a universal 'harm' that's not just seeping wounds).<br/><br/>But I can tell this isn't the best implementation.  I've only had the chance to play Dominion a handful of times; maybe I just need to play it again (and again and again) to get better perspective...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230053/#Comment_230053" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T09:16:42+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  9:16AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, I actually have the beginnings of a write up of an RPG that is largely a reskin of Dominion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe premise is a fantasy wild west boom town ala Deadwood where instead of miners looking for gold in the black hills their Delvers looking for ancient treasure in a newly discovered ancient ruin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is played in two parts with one part being the goings on in the town with vaguely Otherkindish mechanics and where you select the cards that will be part of dungeon play.  The dungeon play is a game of Dominion to see who can grab the most loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy most recent write up has strayed away from pure Dominion mechanics but originally it was almost just relabelling the cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won't have a chance to work on it in detail until I get Blood Red Sands and Robots out the door, but if you want to collaborate to develop it further, I'd be open.  We share similar sensibilities in letting board gameyness intrude in our RPG designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230058/#Comment_230058" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T09:52:35+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  9:52AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ideas.<br><br>What's in your deck tells you true things about your character. Discard pile's face down.
