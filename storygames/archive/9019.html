The pre-titles scene had Debbie rushing around to Albert's house with a pram in time to meet the Doctor &amp; Rose returning to Earth for a visit; upon arrival, Debbie revealed the shrunken form of her boyfriend was in the pram!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis session turned into a two-part episode; the cliff hanger at the end of part one followed on from the cast investigating the nightclub visited by Debbie and her boyfriend the previous night which had been converted into a creche by Artrons! Due to a misunderstanding about human biology, the Artrons were shrinking humans instead of regressing them to babies who would be used to revivify their own species. The Doctor's attempt to reverse this process ended with him &amp; Rose plunging down a bottomless shaft, while Debbie &amp; Albert ran through the corridors of an alien spacecraft...<br/>\n<br/>\nPart two dealt with the divided factions of the Artron race and how the cast used this to make their getaway and also return the shrunken humans to normal size. A cloaked alien ship crashed into Kew gardens, but luckily Debbie's boyfriend worked there (due to a bit of directorial authority!) and was able to whip up a batch of weedkiller that the Doctor pumped into the craft, knocking out the Artrons! UNIT were called in to clean up the mess and the Doctor decided that Rose maybe wasn't the right one for him... but Debbie the slut was! Somewhere out there, the Doctor &amp; Debbie are having kinky adventures in Time &amp; Space...<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanically, this was a roaring success, with the rules now pretty much in their final form: now, the spotlight dice you roll to take on authority for the central character are lost after rollling them, but you can still choose to spend spotlight dice for directorial authority at any time. The peril/resuce conditions were also very effective in guiding players to act in certain ways, leading to some metagaming where players rescued an imperiled character then instantly used the spotlight dice earned as a result to take authority over the Doctor for a scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question over the mod at the moment is what to do about Stress checks and Cool dice from the core InSpectres rules: the games so far haven't used them and haven't suffered as a result. The only downside is that games are over very quickly since players succeed at their actions so often; I ran a game of regular InSpectres at the weekend and was reminded of the importance of Stress in challenging the players. As this mod is GMless, any Stress mechanic needs to be embedded into the basic play mechanics... maybe spending spotlight dice to force a Stress check on an equivalent number of dice? Or taking advantage of characters who are imperiled to Stress them? I'd appreciate feedback from any of the players who have taken part in any of the playtests so far, especially if they are also familiar with regular InSpectres.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
