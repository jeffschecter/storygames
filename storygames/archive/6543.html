Of all their games, Exalted is probably the crunchiest.  And none of them are story games.<br/>But Fair Folk is weird.  I'd argue it's the closest thing WW has made to a "story game."  It seems to give the players more narrative authority (though the use of the in game powers), and given that, in the game world, the only concern of Fair Folk is creating a powerful person story, well... it's interesting.  It's also a book that, when I first read it (which was, I think, before I read or played any real story or indie game) made me go "This is awesome, but what the hell do I actually DO with it?"  Needless to say, I'm interested in seeing the 2nd edition Fair Folk book because even though Exalted 2E is a lot crunchier than I really want to play/run right now, I think they've done a good job of polishing with the other 2E books and all of them have had a little section on how to run/play it in various "styles."<br/><br/>But ANYWAY.  My real question.  I know WW games aren't that popular among this crowd, but I'm still very curious.  Has anyone ever played/run a Fair Folk game of Exalted?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paulie" title="Paulie"><img alt="Paulie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paulie">Paulie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145232/#Comment_145232" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T21:00:09+00:00" title="May 20, 2008  9:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No I haven't I have the book, but I gave it a look and put it away without that thought in my mind.

It's got tons all the crunch and the basic structure of a "trad" game but it also gives the players the mechanical backing to seriously rearrange the world and the story to suit their desires and goals.<br><br>Of course, arguments could be made that with the power levels of even starting Exalted characters from the core book, they have the power to rearrange their world too, just possibly not in quite as literal a sense.<br/><br/>i'm just hoping the new version of the book clarifies the "but what do i DO?" and clears up some of the mechanical confusion without discarding the core ideas.  whenever i hear people talk on podcasts or what-have-you about Changeling someone invariably wonders whether you can play a True Fae - the best thing I've seen from WW so far for playing that kind of creature of living chaos and near-infinite potential is Exalted Fair Folk... and while I didn't really know what to do with the book other than read it in confused and delighted wonder, if the chaos and madness is removed for the sake of making things make sense, well they shouldn't even bother with a new version, IMO.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145265/#Comment_145265" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T06:52:41+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  6:52AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  I brought Fair Folk into a standard Exalted game, it was fun.

In a short lived Abyssals game I had plans for the first "big bad" to be a rogue fair folk.  Bringing them into a normal game is realitively simple.  You can overlook most of the shaping powers and all that insanity.  But I always thought it looked super cool and also super scary to run a game set in at least the middle marches of the wyld with fair folk as pcs.  i think i'd be able to handle it now, with some of the ideas i've just picked up on from reading various indie games.  it would probably work if the players were willing and able to drive everything themselves.  it would probably also work best if they didn't feel the need to avoid conflict between PCs, since as they're decribed, fair folk really have no concern for anything beyond their own story.  it seems like it would work if the players drove their PCs to push to make their personal stories epic and powerful and would sometimes clash and sometimes work with each other, just so long as the stories intertwined.  it would be an insane mess if a group of more than 2 fair folk PCs were totally doing their own thing that had nothing to do with each other at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145863/#Comment_145863" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-24T13:46:04+00:00" title="May 24, 2008  1:46PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never run Fair Folk, but I've read it a half-dozen times.<br/><br/>The book is <i>fascinating.</i> The degree of complexity is very high because it's essentially another system layered on top of Exalted's existing ruleset. However, in-game, this makes perfect sense. The Fair Folk are incapable of true invention - their very nature is to be defined by Creation and its existence. Everything they do or create comes in some part from Creation, warped or twisted or exaggerated. That's why they use the same skills and attributes as people from Creation. The layering is not only part of the ruleset, it's a hidden part of the setting.<br/><br/>Another key to playing Fair Folk is to know that <i>they know they're playing roles.</i> Somewhere between the player and the character is a rarely-mentioned alien creature of chaos who is actually portraying the end character. The player controls (or perhaps through analogy is) that character. So occasionally people will do things totally out of character, or throw away their old lives (character sheets) and make new ones just because they're bored or frustrated with what they were portraying so far. It's not quite like playing someone who's playing Exalted, but there is a certain level of that involved. But on top of that, the alien creatures find out that they can be killed by things from The Machine (Creation), so there's a certain degree to which you're playing D&amp;D players who've found out that some of the NPCs in their game can kill them, but can't stop playing.<br/><br/>Creating relationship maps for groups of Fair Folk is absolutely necessary. And you also have to keep in mind that sometimes someone plays the "Evil Vizier," and everyone around him knows it, and goes along with it, and makes deals and breaks them, and so forth. And someone else will play "The Castle", and everyone else will treat it like a castle... there's a good amount of meta-level thinking going on, but it doesn't have to be really deep.<br/><br/>One of my favorite quotes from Borgstrom (now Jenna):<br/>"I write most games very explicitly so when people sit down, throw together the best character they can, and play kind of twinkily and tiredly, it works out with the kinds of stories I want. That's what I aim for. This apparently never comes across. I should have explicitly said in the Fair Folk mechanics, 'Just put together some twinks with some half-cocked fairy tale qualities in a freehold somewhere. Play shaping combat as poker, because it's really all about how far your opponents will go. Flail around playing the equivalent of a paranoid Amber Throne War. The Charm rules are supposed to turn this into a cool story cycle like the Babylonian myths, your other Exalted game, or 24, without you really trying that hard.'"<br/><br/>For other Fair-Folk-related metaphysics: <a href="http://merin.hitherby.com/archives/000754.html" rel="nofollow">http://merin.hitherby.com/archives/000754.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145946/#Comment_145946" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T14:13:06+00:00" title="May 25, 2008  2:13PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i'm never entirely sure whether i hope Borgstrom (or, apparently, now Moran?) is on board for the 2e Fair Folk book or not.
