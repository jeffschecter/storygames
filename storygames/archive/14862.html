The advice for a game of Ars Magica may be very different from the advice for Toon, say.  For example, I gave one shot at defining categories of RPGs in <br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/fashions.html" rel="nofollow"><b>A History of Fashion in RPG Design</b></a>.  Even within a given game system, there can be very different types of play, though.  <br/><br/>So, let me try a few on for size: <br/><br/><i>Dungeon and/or Mission based play</i> have non-linear collections of challenges where a broad goal is set by the GM, and the players work together to tackle it.  At each location, there are a number of choices of where the PCs may go.  The players tend to control the pacing and scene breaks by choosing when they want to move ahead and where they go.  <br/><br/><i>Action / Set-piece Scene based play</i> jumps back and forth between (1) set-piece scenes that are partly open-ended such as combat or perhaps drama; and (2) strongly GM-controlled narration as the action moves from one scene to another.  This is similar to the advice for games like Star Wars and Deadlands.  <br/><br/><i>Sandbox</i> includes a number of different styles of play based on having a region/scope of play not designed for a particular mission or challenge.  The players can create goals within that scope, but are not assigned missions.  The GM may vary in how actively they toss in complications for the PCs, but they do not supply goals or missions.  <br/><br/><i>PC Rivalry</i> is a style of play based around rivalry among PCs as a driver - such as a throne war or similar scenario in the Amber Diceless RPG.  The GM may set the stage and throw in complications, but much of the action is driven by clashes between PCs and shifting alliances.  <br/>There is a lot of variation in these and possibly whole other categories, but I thought I'd start there and ask for comments.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337981/#Comment_337981" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T06:41:39+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  6:41AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do enjoy your categories based on artistic trends John.

True sandboxes are not common either, in my experience.  However, they are worth mentioning.  Remember that even uncommon traditional styles might be just as big as a more recent story games style, given the larger market for traditional RPGs.  For example, from what I have seen, the Amber-specific conventions (AmberCon US, AmberCon NorthWest, etc.) may have greater total attendance than story games specific conventions like Go Play NorthWest, etc.  <br/><br/>For other examples, the most common would be LARP games along with anything related or inspired by LARP.  It's unclear whether these should be considered traditional, but in my experience it is pretty common for there to be overlap - such as in the World of Darkness.  World of Darkness has long had a large LARP community playing games that generally focus on PC rivalry.  I haven't played much WoD tabletop, but some tabletop games might be influenced by the common LARP structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338038/#Comment_338038" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T10:51:27+00:00" title="August 10, 2011 10:51AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Intrigue oriented role playing games like Vampire: the Masquerade support pvp as well.

That's not to say that it can't be done or that it is even possibly a favoured model by some groups.  Back in my 3.5 days, we often had smaller bits of PC rivalry in our games so we decided to do a campaign where we were all evil and doing bad stuff to one another as well.  We started out in the open, but the practice of passing notes to the GM became common.  The whole campaign culminated with us all using SnapTalk (early mac os 9 chat software) on a local network, all of us in the same room.  The idea was that we would use it to replace notes, but the lying and illusions and backstabbing got so prominent that the final session was almost completely silent, except for the sound of typing and the occasional "WHAT THE FUCK!" "YOU BASTARD!".  <br/><br/>Years later, we were still peeling away layers of the onion of deception with each other, revealing things we had done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338079/#Comment_338079" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T14:22:12+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  2:22PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also Situational GMing that brings a play style that's similar to Sandbox without the map obsession. Clash discussed it <a href="http://www.therpghaven.com/viewtopic.php?p=17739#p17739" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I feel very close to this type of GMing.\n<blockquote>Sandbox GMs create everything upfront. That way, everywhere the players go or do, there is something in place. Every hex is stocked with an encounter or a roll on an encounter table or a place of some sort. This requires an immense amount of prep work. <br/><br/>Situational GMing is more like improv within constraints - these constraints being the NPC or organization's Goals, Personality, and Resources. The goal of an NPC is not to oppose or support the PCs. Those are consequences of the NPC's goals and the PCs' actions. If the PCs go one way, their actions may align with the goals of the NPC, in which case there would be sympathy. If the the actions of the PCs go against the goals of the NPC, there will be opposition. If the actions of the PCs are orthogonal to the NPC's goalsthere will be neither sympathy nor opposition.<br/><br/>What the NPC's actions are are also constrained by his Personality and his Resources. The actions of a character with a vengeful, embittered personality will be very different from those of a character with a laid back, wry personality. Resources limit the scale of the NPC's actions - the response of a wealthy NPC can be much greater than that of a poor one. The same goes for organizations.<br/><br/>The name comes from how the GM works. The GM presents his players with a Situation, which the PCs must respond to. the response of the PCs establishes a vector, with both direction and energy, which is where the PCs want to take things. Depending on what this vector is, the GM responds appropriately from the NPCs, trying to achieve their goals. This goes on until an NPC achieves his goal, the NPCs' Resources are exhausted, or the PCs get what they want. <br/><br/>Along the way, new Situations can be thrown at the PCs. This serves to recharge the group's energy. Situations are the Situational GM's main tool for controlling the pace of the game. These situations can be set up between sessions, or improvised on the spot. The Situational GM does very little prep work. With the three constraints for each major NPC, a simple quick reference of generic opponents, and the initial situation, the GM is good to go. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338147/#Comment_338147" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T21:59:37+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  9:59PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think PC Rivalry does have that potential problem - much like how sports are prone to animosity between teams.  My first Amber campaign had some issues, though not to the point of cursing.  I think calling it a "built-in tendency" makes ugliness sound inevitable, though, whereas I've played plenty of games where the in-character rivalry was good-natured.  I ran a Gothic fantasy campaign where the note-passing was quite thick, and everyone was good-naturedly cursing as the vampire tried to poison everyone, say.  <br/><br/>It's an interesting point about Situational GMing.  It seems closely related to "Bangs" described for the Sorcerer RPG, though I haven't finished reading the thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338251/#Comment_338251" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T10:34:30+00:00" title="August 11, 2011 10:34AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sandbox gaming I do, and is often espoused in OSR circles, sounds like this description of Situational GMing, except that the constraints on the improv are the results of dice rolls interacting with random tables (most often wandering monster tables). I do populate the sandbox somewhat with pre-existing dungeons, but often these provide NPCs to generate situations with rather than being explored in their own right.<br/><br/>I have seen sandboxes that are much more like what Clash describes - <i>"Sandbox GMs create everything upfront. That way, everywhere the players go or do, there is something in place. Every hex is stocked with an encounter or a roll on an encounter table or a place of some sort. This requires an immense amount of prep work."</i> - the one Alex created &amp; we used for the Adventurer Conqueror King demo at Gen Con qualifies (although even here, many of its details grew in play rather than being prepped ahead of time). I haven't thought of these as essentially different, but maybe they should be?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338256/#Comment_338256" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T10:55:05+00:00" title="August 11, 2011 10:55AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly, the only real difference between what Clash describes as "Situational GM-ing" and a (putatively) non-"Trad" game like <b>Burning Wheel</b> or <b>Apocalypse World</b> is that in the Situational model there is no explicit contract that the situations in play will be relevant to the player characters' interests.

From my view, flags and explicit contract about them are old, traditional tools.  Champions (1981) was the earliest explicit version that I recall - where players could specify enemies ("Hunted") and loved ones ("Dependent NPCs") that would be featured in adventures, along with how often they should appear.  This was adopted by lots of other games over the next three decades.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I have rarely seen exactly this "situational" model where the GM only pushes situations that the PCs must react to - either in traditional RPGs or recent story games.  I have trouble thinking of cases other than "Bangs" from the Sorcerer advice section and clash's thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338376/#Comment_338376" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T05:50:48+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  5:50AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, it rather strongly resembles some of the GM advice in later White Wolf games.

I'm now thinking back to earlier attempts to break up GNS-Simulationism into useful categories.  I've begun thinking of these more in terms of the proper social attitude and what the GM's responsible for, and these are what jump to mind:<br/><br/><b>Play my story</b> - Discover the GM's metaplot bit by bit, adding reactions and color along the way and showing how the big picture affects your character moment to moment.  Who knows, in the final scene you might even get some say in whether the badguys destroy the world or not!<br/><br/><b>A sandbox of opportunities</b> - Choose missions and projects from many options, hopefully embedded in an active world that glues them together.<br/><br/><b>Storybox</b> - A blend of the above.  The GM has a plot, and the characters will interact with it, but they have a lot of freedom in how to engage with it and which parts to experience.<br/><br/><b>Emulation</b> - Pick a source fiction and copy the parts that are important to you as well as you can, with the whole group as the arbiter of what's important.  (If the GM's the arbiter, then their attempt to produce a "correct" story arc will become <i>my story</i> or <i>storybox</i>.)<br/><br/><b>Run a Simulation</b> - Set up a fictional situation and a process for exploring it, and then go through that process without any bias or alterations, to find out what will result.  Example: the high concept premise, like Nazi Supers or Cthulhu in Space.<br/><br/><b>System-based challenge</b> - Min-max and find clever rules exploits to win!  GM creates a fair challenge and then tries to beat you with it.<br/><br/><b>Fiction-based challenge</b> - Take your knowledge of how the setting works (usually your knowledge of the real world, applied to a realistic setting) and use it to solve fictional problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339264/#Comment_339264" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T13:11:15+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  1:11PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Nice!<br/><br/>What would you call a "what if?" type of Simulationism? <br/><br/>I suppose it's closest to the actual word "simulation".

Those often talked (elliptically, and buried amidst some amazing bad advice about how to get the players to follow YOUR preferred story) about a style of GM-ing driven by factions and NPCs with motives &amp; resources that would form the "landscape" against which the PCs would inevitably move, and the story was whatever collapse of the status quo that resulted.<br/><br/>Of course, given the usual massive power differential between weak PCs and godlike NPCs and the repeated confirmations that Storytellers were the source of Story, this didn't really work out.
