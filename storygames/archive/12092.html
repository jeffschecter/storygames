The wizards themselves were unhurt, but the same could not be said for apprentices, soldiers under their command and, in one case, evil cultists being hunted down by Brian Blessed.<br/><br/>Basically, most of the time we had available was eaten up with anarchy in the dorm room the PCs were supposed to share. The first two into the room took an instant dislike to each other and made sure to take the beds at opposite ends of the room. The demonologist was the next one in, who took the middle bed. Then Major-General Amuyi arrived with his platoon of soldiers, with the intent to claim the entire room for himself. Before he could be talked out of it, the demonologist attempted to summon a pair of demons. The spell went wrong, bringing dozens of screaming, uncontrollable horrors into the room. In the ensuing battle, someone else tried to use Decay magic to sort things out, but that only made things worse. The alchemist simply used the en suite shower for an hour or so until the carnage had died down. In the aftermath, there was little left of the room other than half-rotted beds, dead soldiers and demon guts.<br/><br/>The opening ceremony was marred by the Major-General's attempts to apprehend his nemesis, a barbarian not-so-cunningly disguised as a wizard. The first speech was delivered by a temporal mage on the topic of the near-misses he'd had with his craft. After the first few times he started over, a random delegate delivered a mercy kill. The meal was one of intelligent clams. The alchemist demanded something else, and received a six foot cube of bean curd. The Major-General recruited some of the intelligent clams to bolster his dwindling force.<br/><br/>Brian Blessed tried to make a new room for himself nearby, but spent the night trapped in a form-fitting pocket in the wall instead. The transforming wizard tried to turn his apprentice into a suit of clothes to replace the ones lost with his suitcases, but that worked rather too well. The clothes took him on a run around the venue which lasted most of the night. The alchemist spent the night patiently eating the bean curd away to nothing.<br/><br/>The only real conference business that was conducted was a debate on the subject of 'Good versus Evil: which is better?'. Brian Blessed appeared as the only member of the panel arguing for Good (the other had all met with mysterious accidents), against three members of the evil cult he was sworn to destroy.The demonologist was the chair of the session. He brought the debate to a close immediately after the cultists' opening speech, before Brian Blessed got a chance to say anything.<br/><br/>The conference ended in disarray during the Wednesday afternoon entertainment. There was a safari of exotic magical beasts. The long-suffering apprentice was turned into a Luggage, as his master felt that form should be capable of defending itself against anything. Unfortunately, the final part of the safari was through a field of Luggages. No-one wanted to play on the Clam Shy, as their plaintive cries were quite disturbing. Similarly, the Hall of Magic Mirrors had few patrons.<br/><br/>As is often the case, the magic got a little too far out of control, and a dread maelstrom appeared. The Major-General's approach is best summed up with a quote.<br/><br/>"There is a deadly maelstrom. What do you do?"<br/>"Men- charge!"<br/>"Now all your soldiers are dead, what do you do?"<br/><br/>Most of the PCs managed to flee the floating palace and ended up in the dangerous Midian forest below. The alchemist decided to try to fuse with the maelstrom, in order to achieve immortality. He called it a success, although while being suspended in an eternity of torment is <i>technically</i> immortality, it's not the kind most of us would want.<br/><br/>It was as crazed as I could have wanted it to be.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
