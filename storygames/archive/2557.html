Veteran (fought monsters, at least once), Investigator (have professional reason to be involved), Attached (care about victim's personally), and Entangled (attached but in a problematic way). <br/><br/>I personally love the backgrounds. But at first, none of my players selected the Attached or Entangled backgrounds. It wasn't for mechanical reasons (the dice the backgrounds give you). None of them felt drawn to those backgrounds because we made characters first before defining the Monster, Situation, or brainstorming potential victims. Without knowing who the victims were, the players felt less excited about playing a background connected to them. <br/><br/>Later on, after a few of the player characters died or went into seclusion, they had no problem choosing the Attached of Entangled background for their new characters as they now knew who the victims were. <br/><br/><b>Traits: </b><br/>Traits are similar to Dogs (as in awesome!). Traits that are supernatural receive an additional d4. Everything supernatural gets you what you want but gets you in trouble. Rock!<br/><br/>My players thought the maximum three dice limit for traits (not counting supernatural dice) was a great idea. It helped focus play and encouraged diversification. Naming traits first, then assigning dice worked wonderfully. <br/><br/><b>Bonds: </b><br/>Bonds are a single die trait that defines things you never or always do. There are 3 bonds: <br/><br/>- Conscious: I'm faithful to my lover<br/>- Tradition: I pay a 10% tithe on all the money I earn<br/>- Nightmare: I kill puppies for satan<br/><br/>Only veterans may have a bond to start the game. As long as you maintain the bond, you gain its dice in every conflict. Bonds of nightmare gain an additional d4. <br/><br/>The mechanical advantage of having a bond as a player seemed minor in play since it's fairly easy to bring traits into a conflict as needed. But the players constantly added them to their characters via experience fall out. They loved what bonds said about their characters. <br/><br/>From my perspective, I loved bonds because they gave me a target. Something I could threaten in a conflict. Very satisfying! One player character developed a bond "I will never eat the flesh of animal again" so through a series of twisted events and in an attempt to assist a possessed victim, I tried to turn his character into a cannibal. <br/><br/>Another player had "Never let myself care about anyone." As a GM, I really couldn't ask for better inspiration to riff off of! More so than Traits, Bonds really felt like the players saying "please GM, please TRY and hit me right here!!!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58796/#Comment_58796" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T14:01:02+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  2:01PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Circumstances: </b><br/>Circumstances are constantly shifting scene conditions specific to each player character. Circumstances are great improv tools for framing scenes, often restrict players mechanically, and really add a horrific tone to the game. There are 4 Circumstances: <br/><br/>- Alone: no other player characters may be included in the scene<br/>- In Trouble: everything that can go wrong right now for your character... does!<br/>- Lost: where ever you want your character to be, you aren't and there is an obstacle keeping your character from his or her destination.<br/>- Unprepared: your character looses access too all of their belongings<br/><br/>At start of play, one Circumstance is true for each character guided by their selected background. Fallout can make Circumstances true or false. And you may have multiple Circumstances true at the same time. You may also change a Circumstance by making it a part of the stakes of a conflict. <br/><br/>To start play, 2 players chose Alone, 1 Unprepared, and 1 Lost. Alone and Lost were very easy to incorporate at start. Unprepared gave me a bit of trouble. Mainly because I wanted to make sure that the player was involved in a conflict where being unprepared mattered. But it didn't quite fit with the specific character and how the game started. I probably spent too much time trying to come up with a situation that didn't naturally fit. It may have been better to simply leave the Circumstance true and let things evolve naturally. Circumstances were great for framing scenes and creating mood but I wasn't sure how much they should drive scenes. If a player gains the Unprepared Circumstance, should the very next scene be all about being Unprepared? Or should the scenes flow as normal with being Unprepared coming in as needed? <br/><br/>We had one scene where a player character was Alone, Unprepared, and In Trouble. <br/><br/>She died! <br/><br/>More about lethality later! <br/><br/><b>Arenas: </b><br/>The Arenas are Research, Social, Athletic, Fighting, and Murder. <br/><br/>You may escalate into any Arena (escalating the entire conflict) in any order. For example, from Social to Murder or Murder to Social. This is also the case in Dogs but an aspect of the game often misunderstood. <br/><br/>There were situations in play where a player would escalate from Social to Athletic by putting a hand on someone's shoulder to access additional dice. I've also seen this several times at convention games. In some cases such a gesture can be a powerful form of communication and persuasion. But I've witnessed it used in an underwhelming fashion in play. I can't remember where I read the rule, I believe in Dogs, that it is important that a player's Raise or Challenge is something that is hard for the opponent to ignore. As a GM I tend to enforce this rule a lot. It feels integral to the spirit of escalation and interacting with the various Arenas in play.<br/><br/><b>Escalating: </b><br/>This is my favorite part! You may now escalate the Arena (conflict) instead of answering (seeing) someone's challenge (raise). You simply escalate and the dice from the outstanding challenge are lost and you make an immediate challenge yourself! <br/><br/>Actual Play and one of my favorite RPG moments ever. It starts simple but wait...<br/><br/>- Conflict: taking<br/>- Stakes: tell us where X victim is<br/>- 2 players: a vampire LARPer (wannabe investigator) and corrupt priest (victim is his wife)<br/>- 1 NPC: hospital administrator<br/>- Circumstances: both players were Unprepared<br/>- Location: basement of hospital<br/>- Background: the players were looking for the priest's wife. The wife committed a vile crime. She wanted to give herself over to the police. Her husband, the priest (player 2), wanted to shut her up as he was on his way to climbing the church's political ladder and didn't need the bad publicity. He made a deal with the above NPC (hospital administrator) to drug his wife and admit her into the hospital for a few weeks while he figured out what to do next. Problem was, he wanted to contact his wife but no one at the hospital knew where she was. The players searched for her but found nothing... except a single mauled finger... a ring finger, wedding band still intact! <br/><br/>- Scene details: The players freaked out! They were convinced the hospital administrator knew something. They were riding a small elevator with her and abruptly hit the emergency stop button between floors. They started talking (screaming), escalated to athletics (holding her down), and finally escalated to fighting (slapping her around). She cried, begged, screamed, plead, shivered, pissed herself, tried to get out... all in a small, sweaty, claustrophobic space... never answering their questions. It was sick and uncomfortable to play. The players were ashamed at what they had done in rage. But then they saw that the hospital administrator had no dice to answer their challenge with their remaining two dice... an 8 and a 6... so at least they would have answers. <br/><br/>I said nothing for 3 long minutes staring at their dice. <br/><br/>"I escalate to murder"<br/><br/>I said in a quiet and deadpan voice.... still looking at their dice!<br/><br/>I threw their dice aside and in that tiny little elevator, with both players' unprepared, stopped between floors, in the basement of a hospital... the hospital administrator transformed into the very thing responsible for every sickening thing that had happened up until that point. And then the players knew why I didn't want them to get into a conflict with the hospital administrator and why I worked so hard to keep her from telling the truth. The adventure climaxed early... but oh what a climax it was!!! <br/><br/>Back to rules, when your opponent escalates instead of answering a challenge, the entire conflict is escalated. The opponent also gets dice for that Arena. But they may not intern escalate into the same Arena instead of answering a challenge. Although they may escalate into a different Arena.<br/><br/>In Dogs I've noticed seasoned players engage in extended talking conflicts, purposely taking the blow to take lots of safe fallout. These new escalation rules change everything. It now matters who escalates first! So although extended talking conflicts still happen, there is a great deal of tension build up at the thought that anyone can escalate at any time and drastically swing the momentum of the conflict. It keeps things unpredictable, dangerous, and exciting! <br/><br/>Escalation is also now an opportunity for others to join in the conflict! Although newcomers may not roll dice for stats already used in the conflict. My players LOVED this! The inability to jump into an extended conflict was something many of my players have complained about in Dogs. And this solved everything perfectly. But don't forget, NPCs on the GM side may also join an existing conflict once it has escalated. <br/><br/>Escalating is now also a scene pacing mechanic! If there are two or more concurrent scenes, you cut between them the moment a conflict escalates! This worked well for us when there were 2 concurrent scenes with 2 conflicts. It worked ok when there were more than 2 scenes as long as there were not more than 2 conflicts. Running more than 2 conflicts at a time was exhausting. And I just didn't have the table space for all the required dice! In certain situations, I would have players not involved directly in a scene run NPCs for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58797/#Comment_58797" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T14:01:30+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  2:01PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Fallout: </b><br/>Experience fall out can buy off circumstances. Although no one ever chose that option. They preferred to change circumstances via conflict. Still a great option! You may also purchase bonds with experience fall out. Which my players LOVED! <br/><br/>When NPCs take fallout, you may choose to reveal information regarding the monster, slaves, acolytes, victims, their relationships to each other, and more! For example: <br/><br/>- Short-term Fallout: reveal single fan from monster write up.<br/>- Long-term/Injury Fallout: name of victim, slave, acolyte or monster's bonds or monster's access to a victim the players know.<br/><br/>This pushed players to escalate just to force Long-term fallout onto NPCs. It definitely made the game more aggressive.  <br/><br/><b>Character Death: </b><br/>We had at least 1 character death every 2 adventures. Monsters + lots of victims = lots of D10s! Which I loved! Although 2 of the players were disappointed as they grew attached to their characters. We play lots of Call of Cthulhu so everyone is used to the idea of loosing characters but closer to the end of the game and this is even deadlier than CoC! But character death has a thematic and mechanical benefit. Every time a character dies, monster dies, victim succumbs to the monster, or victim is released from the monster... everyone received Reflection Fallout! The game is a bit of a meat grinder but the survivors only grow stronger. Half the players liked this, the other half didn't feel the benefit was worth loosing their characters. I didn't feel this way but I can't comment further until I've played Afraid outside of the role of GM. <br/><br/>In the middle of the campaign, Vincent posted an optional rule for Injury Fallout. Instead of dieing, you can place your character into seclusion and make a new character. I believe either the other players receive Reflections Fallout except for you or that no one receives Reflection Fallout. I need to verify. Once your new character dies or is placed into seclusion, you may continue playing your old character.<br/><br/>My players really enjoyed this option. And the second characters they built almost always had either the Attached or Entangled backgrounds to integrate them even closer with the existing NPCs. <br/><br/><b>NPC</b><br/>All NPCs, other than monsters, have 4 traits with different dice for each level of escalation:<br/><br/>- I'm taking this very seriously.<br/>- This falls within my expertise.<br/>- My life depends on this.<br/>- I'm fighting for someone I love.<br/><br/>I enjoy the color of each of these traits. It was easy to handle an NPC in this format and took very little work to write up.<br/><br/><b>Nonhuman Opponents: </b><br/>Nonhuman opponents don't have stats. Instead, they have series of dice with levels escalation built in. Very quick, very elegant and their are several difficulty levels to choose from. For example:<br/><br/>6d6 1d8 1d10, escalate for 3d10, escalate for 1d6 4d4.<br/><br/>AWESOME! Even easier than the above NPCs!<br/><br/><b> Monster, Acolytes, Slaves: </b><br/>Building a monster, acolytes, and slaves works similarly to making a town in Dogs. You answer a series of questions such as:<br/><br/>"The nightmarish resources push her and enable her to make her indulgences even more ritualistic and extreme.<br/>Eventually, she does something irrevocable and life-or-death. She kills, dies, conceives a child, brings someone back from the grave. This transforms her; she's now a monster, a creature all nightmare. She is a danger to humanity: her existence, her influence, threatens the lives, souls or humanity of us all. Name the horror her influence could make of the world."<br/><br/>In addition to the Monster's normal dice, it also receives additional dice for its victims (which you will design as part of the Monster creation process) and levels in which it victimizes them. The players race to save the victims and the monster races to victimize them. If the players identify the victims, the monster's access to them, breaks that access, and blocks any future means... then the monster will grow weaker, loosing d10s!!! As you can imagine, once the players start down this road, and the monster notices... it's going to be pissed!<br/><br/>If you destroy the monster without destroying its acolytes, one of her acolytes becomes the new monster! <br/><br/>Designing the monster, acolytes, slaves and victims took me about an hour. A bit more work than creating a town in Dogs. But in Dogs we usually play for in the same town for 1-2 games. In Afraid we played for 6 games! <br/><br/>Read more Afraid Actual Play <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20030.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23151.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22455.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19934.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20793.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19854.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Now I need to get off my but and write about our Dictionary of Mu Sorcerer game from Dreamation!<br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58807/#Comment_58807" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T14:38:17+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  2:38PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John - This is an excellent introduction to the game! <br/><br/>Bookmarked so that next time i say "you wanna play Afraid this week?" i can find all the pieces in one place!

Once your new character dies or is placed into seclusion, you may continue playing your old character.</blockquote>\nIt occurs to me that it might be a nice addition, in a game where PCs are going into sequester, to use a long term variant of the "We Owe" list idea from In a Wicked Age... <br/><br/>Your newly made veteren may have fled (or gone temporarily insane) thanks to that last monster, but this time...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58820/#Comment_58820" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T15:46:24+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  3:46PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!<br/><br/>The Mark I know made those sheets?

"Habits" and "Jaded" and "Curious" and "Human Harm" and stuff, I just don't know what to do with.  Maybe I'm approaching it too systematically, but it always comes out crappy like, "Habit = Sewing, Curious = Can I sew the perfect doll?" Good start, I suppose.<br/>Now "Jaded".  "Baroque and Ritualistic".  I'm totally drawing a blank.  She always uses the same number of stitches?  She only uses thread made from baby's hair?  She always sits in her same rocking chair while sewing?  She chants "Ph'nglui Mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh Wgah'nagl Fhtagn" while she sews?<br/>And then there's "Increasing Human Harm".  What does that entail?  Being annoying?  Being mean?  Breaking Stuff?  Stealing?  Injury?  Screwing with peoples relationships?  Perversion?  Murder?<br/>Then there is the threat that the Monster poses to us all.  Um... she's going to... I don't know.<br/>Maybe I'm just dense and uncreative, but I can't even make a really crappy Monster, much less one cool enough to use in Afraid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58908/#Comment_58908" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-03T21:42:43+00:00" title="March  3, 2007  9:42PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>Yeah - that really threw me, as well. (For one thing, I kept trying to use popular monsters...)<br/><br/>The trick, i think, is to go all totally hardcore with the progression - it isn't *really* a habit that it starts with, it is an <i>obsession</i>. Monsters aren't really monsters, not at first, they're *hurt* people whose little bit of brokenness has turned the world around them into a nightmare, one which grants them power as it grows worse and spreads to infect new victims.<br/><br/>What makes your voodoo witch a monster isn't that she sews creepy dolls that twist the lives of the people they represent, it is *why* she sews them, why she won't stop hurting people, why doing harm helps her, what void it fills. Her logic-defying reason, her obsession. The magic is almost incidental...<br/><br/>At least, that's the path my monster building has been taking. (Also, i've always liked making monsters a touch sympathetic...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59130/#Comment_59130" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T17:48:22+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  5:48PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.
