(He wasn't nearly as bad as your guy, Arnold, but he definitely made game night way less fun for me).<br><br/>I agree with everyone here that not playing with him is the only real solution. A new game is not going to change or alleviate his basic dickishness.<br/><br/>Once you move on, and game night is more fun, you'll be all like "Whoa, why did we play with that guy for so long?"<br/><br/>But ... lots of the people we game with are connected to us socially in some way, so just saying "Fuck off!" or "Get lost!" is really not a viable option. Being rude or dramatic will just turn it into something bigger than it deserves to be. If you've covered this ground with him before, I think you're okay to just set up other games where he is not involved. Change houses or the day of the week you play for a while. If he learns about these games and asks, then you can be honest.

Let him either explain himself or get defensive and assholish.<br/><br/>If he was completely unaware and seems contrite, give him a second chance.<br/><br/>If he is (as I would expect) a dick about it, give him an ultimatum ("if this behavior at the table when I'm GMing doesn't cease, I will need to ask you to leave" or something similar, be direct).<br/><br/>In either case, unless he up and leaves or refuses your ultimatum and you boot him, run the game.  Call him when he does things you described to him an unacceptable.  Keep a mental tally during the game.  IF he exceeds your patience, walk out with him at the end of the game and ask him not to return while you are GMing.<br/><br/>Oh, I'm assuming that this dick player wouldn't break the group if he leaves.  If that is the case, then I would talk to the players sans the dick player and advise them that you are at the end of your rope and need to take drastic action.  Perhaps a player who knows dick player better offers to talk to him or take care of it.  Then offer the group an ultimatum that either dick player shapes up or you will ask him not to return.  As long as the group sans dick player doesn't object, then you follow the steps above.<br/><br/>I hate these situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273536/#Comment_273536" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T19:55:07+00:00" title="May 28, 2010  7:55PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thor</cite>Slip some heavy sedatives into his drink.

Cos if neither of those things are true (he's only a gaming buddy and you could game much happier without him there) then I'd have to go with everybody else and say that if you're feeling nice, give him a heads up first, and if you're not, boot him out. But if there is something more there than just gaming, this experience might throw that relationship into more light as well, just saying.

If they are 16 or 17, well, that's hormones and fragile ego of youth for you.  If they are older, then I have far less patience for it. At Cons, when I've had enough I usually get up and leave with a short apology (for the other players).  Life's too short and con time is too precious to try to correct the behavior of others. Besides, if I'm a stranger they're not going to listen to me anyhow.<br/><br/>For people that I'm going to play a longer term game with, I also perform the age old "Beer Test", that I heard on a gaming podcast.  Sons of Kryos maybe, or Canon Puncture.  To those that don't know, the "Beer Test" is where I ask myself if I would want to have a beer with this person at a bar and just chit chat. If I wouldn't, then it's a big wake up call, saying that I probably shouldn't play any games with them. If I would, then I ask them if they want to go for a beer, and do the aforementioned chit chat. This way I learn a bit about the person, and pave the way to making a friend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273554/#Comment_273554" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-29T01:04:15+00:00" title="May 29, 2010  1:04AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't need a silver bullet.<br/><br/>Normal rounds will do fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273952/#Comment_273952" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T22:30:37+00:00" title="June  1, 2010 10:30PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2010 10:38PM by Todd_L.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: #0066FF;">Does anyone out there have experience dealing with a player like this:</span><br/><br/>I am a player like this.<br/><br/>I should know better than to say that, because whenever I visualize bad behavior at the table, or identify with a perpetrator;<br/><br/>reality intervenes and the actual bad behavior dwarfs my imagination with new frontiers of human failing, far beyond what I see in the mirror.<br/>And yet...<br/><br/><span style="color: #0066FF;">-Constantly interrupts other people</span><br/><br/>I am prone to manic enthusiasm.  And prone to having overthought games so much beforehand, that I'm overprepared and overexplain nuances, implications, ranges of choice available... especially when trying to prompt players who seem hesitant.

I hope I'd defend the notion in a civil manner.  But if someone who disagreed were too dismissive, refusing to hear me out, I might stoop to cheap boasting and mockery.  I'm not proud of that, because two wrongs don't make a right.  But, I can see it happening.  Have the players on the other side of the issue left enough room for everybody to agree-to-disagree?  Or does your problem player feel like there's not enough room for his point of view to co-exist at all?<br/><br/><span style="color: #0066FF;">-Leaves the table or talks over the scene when his character isn't involved</span><br/><br/>Hard to defend.  But I gotta ask-- is this willfully inconsiderate, or is this a symptom of an inability to contain themselves?  Is it really that they player can't be bothered to behave correctly/ or is it that they can't figure out how-to behave right, even if they wanted to?  <br/><br/><span style="color: #0066FF;">What I'm asking is, has anyone found a silver bullet?</span><br/><br/>Yes.

But mean it... make sure they indeed Don't have to act out, to feel like they're allowed to be themselves at the table.  Make sure there really is a reasonable alternative, and that they know it.<br/><br/>One other thing.  This worked on me once:  You know how Jack Black or Seth Rogan get to play smart alec dick characters, but they're so devilishly charming that the audience is on their side?  Well, that sucks for guys who aspire to be like their cool jerkwad idols; but lack the magic appeal to pull it off.<br/><br/>One time in particular, a game group just flat-out INDULGED me, bigtime.  <b> It would have been reasonable to fear that indulging me would create a monster, by 'rewarding' bad behavior.</b>  But for whatever reason--  they played-along.  Not begrudingly, but to-the-hilt.  It was immensely gratifying to me, and therapeutic-- to be a prize ass and get nothing but kudos for it.  I hope the other players were pleasantly surprised at how fun it was to let my bull-in-a-china-shop routine generate adversity to play off. (But I know it had to be unnerving, too.)   Just doing it once, I got it out of my system, to a large degree.       Is this something you could try?

Make it about their behaviour and not them. Talk about incompatible play styles rather than personal failings. Also, let it come from you, and not the group.
