It's an opportunity to connect with potential playtesters<br/><br/><b>Principles for posting:</b><br/><br/>* Tell us about your game(s) in one post. Feel free to mention your game even if you've talked about it in last month's thread. The idea is to inform us about what you're doing now.<br/><br/>* Optionally: tell us what you're hoping to achieve this month.<br/><br/>* If you want to link to another thread, post, or rules document, go for it.<br/><br/>* There's no maximum number of games you can talk about. If developing your game is a genuine focus for you this month, then put it up. (This bit is definitely an experiment, so let's test how it works. If the thread gets a bit spammy, then maybe we need a different/actual limit.)<br/><br/><br/><b>If you're responding to a game someone else has posted about:</b><br/><br/>* Number your response (first response: [1]; second response [2]; third response [3]). If you see that you're the second person to post, "Wow, that looks cool!" to a post here, then put a "[2]" at the top of your post. <br/><br/>* The fourth person to post should just take their comment and create a new thread (or talk on an existing thread about the game), to continue the discussion.<br/><br/><br/><b>Previous Threads</b><br/><a href="story-games.com/forums/discussion/19943/games-in-playtesting-development-january-2015" rel="nofollow">January 2015</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/442418/#Comment_442418" rel="nofollow">February 2015</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443535/#Comment_443535" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T04:06:01+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  4:06AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope everyone who posted last month feels happy with what they've designed <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As of this afternoon, I've "finished" editing <b>Soth</b>.

And how this \u2018gift\u2019 of true power transforms them until they can no longer can relate to the world or people they once knew, and likely leaving irrevocable harm in their wake. <br/><br/>It is a GM-full cooperative rpg storygame for 3-5 people that should take between 3-5 hours. Gameplay plays out in chapters and scenes as characters grow from fledgeling hero just acquiring their powers to being superheros to eventually being so powerful they are nearly gods. The mechanics are fairly simple focusing less on how much a plasma ball does to an ice wall and more on the relationships that you have with friends, allies, and enemies, and the relationships you loose. Basically what it's like to be superheroes like Dr Manhattan with powers so beyond mere mortals that you become distant to anyone or anything you once held dear.<br/><br/>I have my first two playtest sessions next week which I'm excited about! I'm hoping to have 3-4 in-person playtest sessions over the course of this month and maybe run another via Google Hangouts. <br/><br/>More info on my Fun &amp; Frolic Mirth Peddlers game site: <a href="http://mirthpeddlers.com/2015/03/unstoppable-power-playtesting-now/" rel="nofollow">Unstoppable Power Playtesting Now</a><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://mirthpeddlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Unstoppable-Power-v2.png"/><br/><br/>p.s. <a href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">@Steve_Hickey</a> Soth looks awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/michael.harrel" title="michael.harrel"><img alt="michael.harrel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/michael.harrel">michael.harrel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443803/#Comment_443803" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T04:13:07+00:00" title="March  8, 2015  4:13AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am working on a game called Pockets, in which the characters, all fictional versions of the players, are wanderers on tiny islands floating in the void. The characters spend the game solving problems and puzzles to travel between there "pocket worlds", while searching for a way back home. The character sheet is a just list of the items each player has in their pockets when the game begins, (plus one mysterious item each). <br/><br/>This was an unfinished GameChef entry a few years ago (that year the ingredients were all pictures), and it's kind of followed me around ever since.

I am always looking for some feedback!<br/><br/><img alt="image" height="321" src="http://www.daimongames.com/judas/images/cover6x9black.jpg" style="border: 0px;" width="214"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443806/#Comment_443806" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T08:50:25+00:00" title="March  8, 2015  8:50AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sketching out another AW hack, after the idea was suggested by Seth Harris &amp; Ariana Ramos: it's an emulation of movies and TV shows like <i>The Goonies</i>, <i>Explorers</i>, <i>The Monster Squad</i> and <i>Eerie, Indiana</i>, where a gang of kids have fantastic adventures.<br/><br/>My take on this is <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1iTjRUomaBXUGlhREs2cDdVdm8&amp;usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Troublemakers</a>, but Ari &amp; Seth are also at work on a hack in this vein, so hopefully  at some point we'll compare notes and see what we've each come up with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443811/#Comment_443811" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T10:59:53+00:00" title="March  8, 2015 10:59AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2015 11:04AM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently playtesting <b>Five Geek Girls &amp; a Guy</b> - a gender-flipped nerd-friendly <i>Big Bang Theory</i> - after being inspired by the 'show that will never be made'<br/><a href="http://www.googledrive.com/host/0B9aDy3dv5nWvbzdJck5lOWhtekk" rel="nofollow">cover</a><br/><img alt="image" src="https://0c4e62caab8f0b40c2de7d6f052058dacf3d0988-www.googledrive.com/host/0B9aDy3dv5nWvbzdJck5lOWhtekk"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443817/#Comment_443817" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T14:30:54+00:00" title="March  8, 2015  2:30PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2015 2:31PM by Luzelli.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently working on a Hack of FFG's Edge of the Empire called PsyberOps.<br/>The players play as psionics in a predictably dystopian cyberpunk world.  Their newfound powers are slowly fracturing their sanity as they finally scratch the surface of what really goes on in their world.  What can they accomplish in the time they have left?<br/><br/>Currently, I am working out my "crit table" of the long-term effects of extended psionics use.  My game is something of a hybrid between edge of the empire and the free-form casting seen in WoD's Mage, with a veneer of impossible future tech.<br/><br/>Hopefully, if FFG doesn't sue the pants off of me, I'd like to release this as a free hack of my favorite system thus far with my favorite setting.  Right now my manuscript is clocking in at about 63 pages.

It was originally called Song of Steel, but due to another game acquiring a similar name, we rebooted and rebranded. <br/><br/>In the last two years or so, we've shifted direction significantly and the thing is its own beast now, drawing influences from everything from Apocalypse World to Burning Wheel. The game is currently called Band of Bastards, and it is perhaps best described as a renaissance-era dark-fantasy spaghetti western of sorts. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XadWJzI9Ngk/VQtls942mkI/AAAAAAAAAa4/P8zprRLnv8A/s1600/BandofBastardsNewLogo1200.png"/><br/><br/>We currently have a <a href="http://grandheresy.com" rel="nofollow">website</a> that's had some nonsense posted over the last year or so as we update and change things, a newsletter that one can sign up for (and around 100 subscribers so far) that we're using for announcements, a forum where we have at least a few people regularly posting. <br/><br/>We are about to do a public beta, and as of today have leaked the intro text / first chapter just to test the waters. This is in part because we felt like leaking something, but mostly because I hate writing salesy / intro stuff and I wanted some feedback. That can be grabbed here: <a href="http://www.grandheresyforums.com/pdf/BandofBastards01Intro.pdf" rel="nofollow">grandheresyforums.com/pdf/BandofBastards01Intro.pdf</a><br/><br/>If anyone actually reads it, let me know what you think - either replying here, or giving me a PM. <br/><br/>But yeah, that's what's on my plate at the moment.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
