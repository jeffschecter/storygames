                    Issue #1: Would "threads started" work better on top rather than "Bookmarks"? (I'd prefer it)<br/><br/>Issue #2: Duplication in threads started and bookmarks is annoying me; should I just not bookmark threads I start? (Is there any other effect of bookmarking?)<br/><br/>Issue #3: Even by unbookmarking my own started threads, I'm building an extensive list in that nav bar. As time progresses, this could turn into a problem (hundreds of bookmarks).<br/><br/>Maybe a collapsable subfolder that stores inactive but bookmarked discussions that are older than two weeks? That is, if two weeks go by and nobody posts to a discussion, its bookmark falls into the "Sleeping Posts" collapsing menu.<br/><br/>CU                </div>
