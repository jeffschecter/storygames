We played it last night and it went pretty well so I'm looking for groups of people who are willing to playtest it. It's definitely on the Story Games end of the spectrum.<br/><br/>Jason has an early copy but it has evolved not inconsiderably since then and is more a serious game than it was. But it's still only 12 pages long.<br/><br/>Here's the introduction to give you a flavour of what the game is about. Don't read too much into it. It's possibly all boasting.\n<blockquote>Tbilisi is a new kind of roleplaying game. <br/><br/>As in all roleplaying games, the players play some kind of character. In most games, characters are involved in actions with each other and these actions are resolved in reference to the characters capabilities.<br/><br/>Tbilisi takes a different approach.<br/><br/>Characters are for the most part directly described in terms of how a player may influence the game. This may seem like a wrench but if you think about it, it\u2019s how all the other games work too. They just obfuscate the player control of the game through terms such as hit points, mana and skills.<br/><br/>In this game, I haven\u2019t done away with describing player control of the game in terms of the character. To do so would completely would reduce the importance of the character as a representation of the player in the game. That would be like playing As and Bs instead of Cops and Robbers. That wouldn't be much of a roleplaying game. So ...<br/><br/>Reach for the sky, varmint!<br/><br/>The rules to the game are presented in four sections:<br/>- Setting up: what to do before you get into character.<br/>- Game Master guidance: how the GM runs the game.<br/>- Feats: how players influence the game<br/>- Play: how play proceeds.<br/><br/>There is also an appendix with character and GM sheets.</blockquote>\nPM me with somewhere I can send the game if you're interested in playtesting. I'm not really interested if you only want to read it. Actual play is what is required at this stage. I'd also ask that you don't share the game around. I would like to publish it.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Steve                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115127/#Comment_115127" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T13:47:25+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  1:47PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's no particular limit.
