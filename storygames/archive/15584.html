I ran Mouse Gaurd for the first time for two players. It went okay but no mater how many times you read the rules before you play you really have no idea how a game is going to play till you get it on the table. I think nect time i will forego the pregen characters and spend the time to make new ones. Hopefully next time we get a few more people and maybe a second game too. <br/>\n  Next time will be on the 28th of January. I am not sure about going back to the coffee shop, we will see.

We just moved here, and I haven't yet located any of my RPG books in all the boxes (except Burning Wheel Gold, which somehow ended up with pots and pans). So not sure I could bring anything except something free that I printed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Blackbird? Danger Patrol?<br/>\n<br/>\nLong term, I'd love to try Mouse Guard, although I recognize you probably don't want to run it two weeks in a row. I'm personally fascinated and obsessed with Diaspora, which hits almost all of my buttons, but I've never been able to play it yet. And of course I'd be game for any of the current indie darlings like Fiasco or Apocalypse World. Actually I love AW concept and it looks awesome, but again it's something I haven't played. I have played Polaris, which can work really well as long as you take it seriously, but it is total crap with any hint of smugness or sarcasm. Other favorites are Spirit of the Century-- any FATE game really. Not a Dresden Files setting fan, but I can appreciate the beauty of the game design.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about practical matters? Mark says maybe not the coffee shop this week. If not, then where? And can I add a request to keep it in Selah? That's a bit of a shorter drive for me coming from Ellensburg. Also, what time? I'm looking forward to meeting you guys!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MLevad" title="MLevad"><img alt="MLevad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MLevad">MLevad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356745/#Comment_356745" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T11:22:18+00:00" title="January 30, 2012 11:22AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The get together on Saturday was great.

What I thought Wa going to be a game somewhat like To Catch a Thief turned into hard core Cthonic horror.

Saturday is coming and I hope we get some good gaming in. Dave has offered to run either Dread or Danger Patrol. Thanks Dave, either one would be great. <br/>\nI was wondering what people would think about moving over to Bill's Place in Yakima. There is a lot more room and they have beer and great food. It is only about 5 minutes away from the coffee shop for those who are worried about drive time. Another option would be to go over to Ron's Coin and Collectables over on Nob Hill and of course we could always stay at North Town in Selah. What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
