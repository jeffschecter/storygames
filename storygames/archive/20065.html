I don't consider my group dysfunctional. Nobody got humilliated nor there were any arguments or hard feelings after all was settled.<br/><br/>Last session only a couple of players showed up, so instead of starting from where we left the last week, I improvised a flashback of an adventure these PCs had on their own. To make it short, both players went too far trying to obtain information and extra equipment they couldn't afford nor actually needed. I'm not so sure I could call them murderhobos, since it wasn't their intention (at first) to kill some villagers and loot them; it was just that these NPCs were in the way of the things they wanted.<br/><br/>The thing is we all had fun, but I think I could have made the session more enjoyable by letting them get their way more easily and being more prepared for them to just pick up some loot that made sense for that town (they were asking for explosives, magic potions and such but I just said that the town was just too small and unimportant to have that.)<br/><br/>I dunno, I didn't exactly enjoy completely the way things went. I didn't pull out big guns to railroad them into leaving the village alone, I just tried to make the vilage react realistically and smart against a kidnapping, theft and murder (things escalated more or less in that order). Five villagers tried to stop them, two got killed in a gruesome way, plus another two bystanders among the casualties. It didn't made sense to present further resistance in such an small town.<br/><br/>But later things went in a way that felt a bit like exacting justice in the PCs. Most of it was just though luck on the dice, anyway. Karma hit them and though nobody died nor lost anything valuable, later that night I though if it wouldn't have been more fun to make players feel like they were playing Grand Theft Dungeon.<br/><br/>So I would honestly love to hear your ideas on how to make the world into a muerderhobo paradise while keeping it interesting.<br/><br/>From what I brainstormed with a friend of mine:<br/><br/>-Make merchants and NPC in general less good, more neutral and somewhat evil. Not everyone needs an evil plot but there's surely some skeletons in their closets, people they hate and victimize, vices and petty crimes they commit, etc. And of course, they are coward and weak enough to plead innocence and blame others for it. You can't say these despicable lot hadn't seen it coming.<br/><br/>-Have merchants offer them quests that involve ruining their competition in some way or another. The party can keep whatever they find, they only want to ruin the business of the guy across the street anyway, while not getting caught in the process.<br/><br/>-Build these as urban dungeons. Each merchant store is a room and has it's own set of traps (legal and physical), puzzles (interactions with different vendors and people on the street) and monsters (guards and other NPCs who can interrupt the party business). Streets, roofs and alleys could be set up for interesting chases and even prepared beforehand as escape routes or access points by the party.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion" title="Ecthelion"><img alt="Ecthelion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/725/nSOWTUWM8G2D0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion">Ecthelion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443557/#Comment_443557" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T17:25:56+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  5:25PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say... let them have they hobomurder fun, if they wish (and all players are having fun).<i> But!</i> All your actions have consequentions... and since that was a flashback, i would expect that people they murdered had family, frineds, allies, protectors... that authorities have investigated their death... and that they would be recognized and would have to face fallout of what they did so long ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443566/#Comment_443566" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T20:02:00+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  8:02PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd tempted to go into provocative question mode and start developing challenges and opponents based on what the players are into. At least as a starting point: for instance, if they think the shopkeeper is a bit dodgy/suspicious in their eyes, great, I'll make him the front man for some kind of mafia enterprise.<br/><br/>I was going to add more, but your three brainstormed points cover it all: those are really solid!<br/><br/>* Make everyone sketchy, questionable, corrupt. Twisted.<br/>* Everyone has goals; the PCs' presence destabilizes the status quo. So everyone wants a piece of them, needs them to steal something from their enemies, etc.<br/>* Pick a "setpiece", like a small town, a castle, a court, an outpost (a la Keep on the Borderlands), and do it up as a big dungeon with lots of opposing factions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443571/#Comment_443571" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T20:16:27+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  8:16PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2015 8:16PM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Paul_T! I've gotta make some sort of random table to make up some stuff on the go. Yep Etchelion, I already planned a few things so far. The main villian who escaped along with his minions the last session would definitely make a comeback, and even perhaps he would return as a hero to save the people the party had wronged, even try to avenge them. It makes sense for him to earn a level in the druid class giving the circumstances, and there are a couple other characters he could join in this quest. The more people the party upsets along the way, the more organized they will become.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
