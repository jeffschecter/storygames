You know the Generating Deep Cultures thread? Of course you do. I have done my best to pilfer every single comment there for the delicious awesome juices within. Granted, there's room for improvement, room that I intend to thoroughly exploit... But I really wanted to have this out before I cram too many details in, lose track of how they interact, and then lose interest altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any comments (this is the first thing I ever made, so I bet there're plenty of begginer mistakes I made), whether on the game mechanics, or the game text, or whatever you feel is relevant, shoot.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233323/#Comment_233323" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T17:32:49+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  5:32PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!  I like a lot of what you've got here.  The cycling of traits as positive and then negative over the course of the game is very intriguing.<br/><br/>I would, however, strongly recommend you normalize what traits do \u2014 do positive traits lower difficulties and negative traits raise difficulties (which is counter-intuitive), or do positive traits add to die rolls and negative traits subtract (which is lots simpler for the readers, I suspect).  You present it both ways, and while, at the end of the day, they're more or less the same thing, getting it straight from the start will simplify things later.<br/><br/>Because when I get to Arenas... dude, you totally lose me.  I don't understand, at the start, why anyone wants to do this, and therefore I don't understand in the middle why it's worth spending all these traits to get it, and I don't understand at the end why anybody's bothering to contest it.  Additionally, as the arenas don't appear in any format on your example character sheets, I'm not even sure what they look like when written down.  Now, I'm sure you've got something in your head that makes sense \u2014 you're just not communicating it to this reader.  Some examples up front would go a long way to explaining what's up.<br/><br/>I'd like to see this game get its feet under it and see how it plays!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233365/#Comment_233365" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T03:40:18+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  3:40AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for reading!<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried hard to normalize the terms I use accross all of the text, but the challenge difficulty increase/decrease versus adding/subtracting from rolls slipped by me. Good catch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Arenas... Yeah, I get about a 40/60 ratio of people getting it nigh instantly and going wth?. That's a pretty horrible ratio, I know, so lemme try and explain what I want the Arenas to do, and you tell me what, if anything, makes it click for you, okay?<br/>\n<br/>\nArenas are not on the group-sheets because they do not belong to a group, the belong to the world as a whole. One way to think of Arenas is as an Age of some sort - Age of Exploration, Industrial Age, the Age of Wizardry, whatever. Obviously (and unlike, say, the Civ game series), there can be more than one such "Age" going on at the time. I'm fairly sure there are games that have a "so this is the general feel we'll use" thing going on - the difference in my game is that such general themes do not get prescribed in advance of play, they emerge during it, and then change into something different, much like they would in "the real world."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, an "Age" is basically a sort of time when lots of similar things happen. This doesn't mean that every group undergoing an "Age" is working in unison with every other group to maintain these similar things - every group is out there for its own benefit, trying to exploit the achievements of others as much as they try to make their own... For instance, when everyone else is doing exploration, it is in many ways easier for you to do that as well - because there is plenty of knowledge about it and plenty of people that know how to do it... Though you have to make a bare investment in taking advantage of this knowledge (in-game: make an Institution and enter it into an Arena), as well as having enough "home" resources to be able to go in that direction at full steam (in-game: traits that can reasonably be used to take advantage of the Arena).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you create a very barebones Arena. Then someone else comes over and adds to it. Irregardless of whether they were doing so in order to help you or to spite you, their additions may work to help you, as well. However, as your friend or rival make the addition, they drift the Arena towards what's useful to them, and you have to choose between adapting to the change or tackling it head on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example from a very early playtest that did not yet have the Arena mechanics as they are now, but worked much like I would like it to have worked (though we did not continue the game past that point): the game was of ratfolk who have just managed to buy their way into the city's human nobility versus a creepy snake-cult that kept trying to summon giant snake demons and take over the city by force. The ratfolk, played by me, created an Arena that gave them hefty bonuses whenever they did anything to influence the city against snakes... And the snake-cult then created an inner sub-group that planted snakes into their targets' homes, redirecting the much-deserved ire of the cityfolk against the enemies of the snake cult.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn Arena is not a thing, not a flat "advantage" the way "I have guns" is, it is an abstracted away relationship between groups, their technical and organizational innovations, and their ability to make use of others' technical and organizational innovations, the way "Me and my foe both have guns, so this changes the landscape of battle in ways I must prepare to face" is. If you want an A-bomb, you can work for it and make your own, you can take advantage of the work other people have already made to it and make your own, or you can just steal one from someone else when it's made. Whichever way you choose, you do need to make choices, and you do need to make investments.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that may be confusing in the game text itself is how the game uses Institutions as intermediaries between a group and an Arena. The Institution step in the spend traits -&gt; get an Institution -&gt; enter a Segment to an Arena is as of now absolutelly superflous as far as mechanics go. I could have made it simply so that you spend some of your traits and get a Segment, but the added step tied it in with the narrative in a way I liked - you own an Institution, and you use it to make and maintain changes in an Arena, but those are changes that you have only limited control over.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis make any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233446/#Comment_233446" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T10:44:16+00:00" title="September 21, 2009 10:44AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>This make any sense?</blockquote>Not yet. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Okay, if players own institutions, can they go on the character sheets, maybe?<br/><br/>If arenas and their segments don't go on character sheets, where <em>do</em> they go?<br/><br/>What, in gritty mechanical terms, does me making an institution do for me?

It's just that I did put those things in and I would like to know why they didn't seem to register. Any wording I should change? Add some more explanation? Remove confusing bits?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in case the quotes don't do the job of explaining the mechanic well (which they likely don't), here's thing as straightforwardly as I managed to put it:<br/>\n<br/>\nInstitution = allows you to create Segments. More powerful Institutions allow you to create more Segments.<br/>\nSegment = The thing in the (brackets) that tells you what you have to do in the fiction to get the bonus.<br/>\nArena = A series of Segments. The more Segments, the larger bonus to any of your Challenge rolls you may receive.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, "(create)(poisons)(in secret)(for trade)" is an Arena, "(create)", "(poisons)", "(in secret)" and for "(for trade)" are Segments. Also, "Poison Industry(3)", owned by Player One, and "Venom Tankers(1)", owned by Player Two, are the Institutions that were used to create the Arena. Whenever either Player One or Player Two (but not Player Three and etc.) undertake a Challenge that involves creating poisons in secret for the purpose of trade, they get a +4 bonus to their roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when spending traits for creating Institutions, you trade off +3 temporary bonuses for a +1 bonus with a little more longevity.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and was there any confusion on what "spending a trait" means in that context? "Spending" here means going from good(+) to neutral(0) and from neutral(0) to poor(-), not getting rid of it altogether. I remembered writing in something in the original that would put emphasis on this, but after a double-check, it seems I might have removed that bit in editing for whatever reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnnd... Arenas should go on the World Sheet (It'd likely help if I attached an example world sheet along with the group sheets...). I had that in mind and for some reason expected any readers to read my mind about it. Will definitelly fix that. And the Institutions should go on the group-sheet somewhere... Or perhaps on the World-sheet somewhere, to better show ownership. In all honesty - an Institution is often created, immediatelly fused into an Arena, and then forgotten on the spot. I planned to do some work Institutions to make them more useful and interesting, but I wanted too see how the bare mechanics works first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233479/#Comment_233479" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T12:46:02+00:00" title="September 21, 2009 12:46PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So are institutions one-time-use things that get created to add segments to an arena, or are they of use later?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233636/#Comment_233636" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T09:16:15+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  9:16AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're one-time-use things.
