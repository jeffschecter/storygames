If a game won't let me do anything I want then it's no good!"<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was thinking about it while raking the yard this morning, and I said to myself "Well, that's a statement of awfully rugged individualism, really.  The person is unwilling to take orders, unwilling to even accept the <i>concept</i> of submitting to any authority in their gaming.  That's sorta neat."  And it is.  Individualism's cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept ... they insist that everyone be individuals with them.  If you wanna hang with them then you have to reject the notion of authority in your gaming <i>too</i>.  Many of the people who get keen on this idea, in fact, seem to take it as a <i>personal offense</i> if somebody doesn't want to take on their personal brand of individualism.  Life of Brian moment, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's what I think:  I think the "RPGs can do anything!" meme is a secret little counter-culture.  People want to create a vast and unbridgeable gulf between the cool games THEY play, and the lame, mainstream games that are played by the common proles with their boards and cards and dice ... and the idea of rules constraint is where they intend to draw that line.  That's how they Stick it to the Man.  And, as with all good counter-cultures, you are either with them or against them:  You have to non-conform in the way that reassures them about their non-conformity.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeeling superior yet?  Because here's the thing:  Our little Story Games break back <i>toward</i> rules and structure and a willingness to exercise our <i>freedom to choose constraint</i> is how <b>we</b> Stick it to the Man.  System Does Matter is as much a matter of flying your particular brand of geek-flag as Rule Zero is.  It's a counter-counter-culture, or some damn thing.  And we live it up, with our "hippy" language and our soviet chic and all that jazz.<br/>\n<br/>\nSheesh.  I don't wanna be a communist.  Communists have consistently gotten their collective (and collectivist) asses handed to them for decades.  Why would I wanna bite the style of a bunch of <i>losers</i>?<br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno ... maybe it's just human nature.  Maybe the basis of community is that it pulls people toward more and more conformity, and the basis of freedom isn't to act independent of that but rather to push and pull against it.  Maybe continual tension is natural.  It's just wierd.  So damn wierd.  Why we gotta go from doing our own totally individual thing to wanting everybody to do our own totally individual thing just the same way?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103833/#Comment_103833" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-19T09:21:20+00:00" title="October 19, 2007  9:21AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Player</b>: Game X doesn't do what I want.

They have a break point, if you twist them too far they fall apart, but there is some give.  Some are more flexible than others'; some can handle being tampered with quite a bit and still be recognizably and functionally Game X, while others' mechanics are rapidly unbalanced by tinkering.  <br/><br/>A few New, Improved, INDIE! (TM) games, however, are labelled "Do not open".  When you try playing it with your group, you may discover that it doesn't quite fit.  And look for ways of adjusting what doesn't fit for your group while preserving what does (or could), asking around on the dedicated forums and lists, you trigger a chorus of "You're not playing it right!", "It's finely tuned and you can mess with the system like that!", and "That's not the way the designer intended it to be played."  I really mean with <i>any change at all</i>, not with gross Frankenstein jobs.  <br/><br/>It's particularly galling when it's the designer who insists that the game has to be played in a very narrow range.  Yes, but dude, I'm telling you that our group has some problems with this.  Is it an all-or-nothing proposition?  We <b>have</b> to play this game in exactly this way and like it, or if we don't like it we should just go play something else?

To me it's important to try a game once as-is to see if it's for you, like tasting something without salt or ketchup before you gob it on. However, if you want to tinker after that I'm all for you. In fact if you want to tinker before that that's good too, but I can sympathize with the frustration of the game's writer to a small degree. The only time I think it's illegitimate is when you've never played it as written, then you complain about the game being broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104004/#Comment_104004" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T06:36:04+00:00" title="October 21, 2007  6:36AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2007 5:38PM by scottdunphy.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul</cite>It would sit far better with most, I think, if the assumptions were writ large in the promotional text accompanying the game.<br/><br/>"This game requires extremely structured communication."<br/>"Players of this game will be required to regularly push the boundaries of graphic description."<br/>"This game assumes all players are willing to creatively invest in the world design."<br/>"This game is intended to provoke discussions of sexual identity."</blockquote>\nThat's a great idea.
