Certainly *I* prefer reading short games, but I won't fault a designer for taking up a lot of my time &amp; paper if I feel it was necessary in communicating the game's idea/play/essence.\n<blockquote>2. More generally, in a design sense are short games better than long games?

Is there a middle-ground?</blockquote>\nMy answer is going to be rather unhelpful:  whatever is necessary for conveying the play experience you want to evoke.  If that means flavor text, as in Shreyas's games, it's very much needed.  I think examples are crucial for any game, and don't think they would go amiss (as I'm in the "game text is first and foremost meant to teach" camp).  I felt that the pages I devoted to the palace rooms in Know Thyself were necessary for giving an example framework for how to use the game -- they weren't part of the core mechanic, but I think without it the game would have been less complete.  And recall that completeness is one of the criteria used in judging.<br/><br/>Which, I suppose means this:  if you think that the game shouldn't be able trying to stuff text and text in a document -- text that may not be "necessary" -- in order to fulfill one of the contest's goals, perhaps there should be a discussion about changing that goal.  What people think is a "complete" game differs heavily, and you're going to see that when people submit entries and with others judge/critique them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66913/#Comment_66913" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T11:01:16+00:00" title="May  4, 2007 11:01AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Hey Adam, there's this thing that Jon and I have batted around, the game-chefish game. I'll see if I can get him to unpack it.<br/>But basically the idea is that, uh, one looks to the current frame of reference for content and structural standards, not outside it.<br/></blockquote>\nFair enough. Let me counter this by asking "who sets the current frame of reference"?<br/><br/>If it is the organizer (as I believe) and no length is specified as in Game Chef... then it seems pretty clear that you should write as much as you feel is necessary. Will writing too much dilute the overall quality of your work? Probably. Will writing a long document make it harder for people to give good feedback ? Maybe (I would argue that clarity and ease of reading is the operative variable here). Will writing "War and Peace:the game" ensure that less people read and review it? Almost certainly.<br/><br/>But the choice to do it and accept the possible consequences, is left to you.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you are arguing that as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">universal rule</span>, expecting people to read documents beyond a certain length is cruel in a Peer Review scenario... I completely disagree. If you enter a 'short story' writing competition and someone gives you 300 pages, you would rightfully be miffed and probably read little (if any) of it. If you enter a 'write a novel' contest and complain that you have to read something more than 20 pages long... I think you would be foolish to complain. If you enter a contest that says 'write a story' and doesn't tell you how long it is supposed to be... at that point it comes down to personal preference. <br/><br/>I think a Game Chef where participants were required to create a game of 15 pages and under would be a lot of fun. It would probably provoke more detailed reviews of everyone's games and certainly would encourage everyone to read more <i>in toto</i>... but unless Andy (or whoever runs the contest after him) wants to set that specification (and you should certainly suggest it to him)... then I do not presume to enforce such a limit on others.<br/><br/>Part of the 'length' problem is that, for good or ill, allowing 2 weeks (rather than 1) lets people add in some non-essential stuff that was not present in previous years. *shrug*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66915/#Comment_66915" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T11:05:41+00:00" title="May  4, 2007 11:05AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think "the history of Game Chef" is a pretty good frame of reference.

I might even go less than that, maybe a "Pamphlet Game Design Contest" where the game has to be a maximum of four pages (at 8.5" x 11" or less) and readable when printed out (so that you're not cramming in text and telling people to use Acrobat at 400% to read it) -- of course, along with whatever other design conditions (like Ingredients, theme, whatever) that the contest has.

Rather than tread that ground, let me instead say this:  if you feel so strongly about this, be the change you want and create a document that helps convey this to the new Game Chef participants.  I'm no more likely to go and hunt down the last five or so years of games as I am to read all 5000+ threads on this forum before posting.  And since Game Chef essentially starts anew every year, the new person stumbling in doesn't seem to have immediate, ready access that he knows about for this prior context.

But if that's what he meant to convey, I'll concede that I misunderstood.<br/><br/>After reading John's comment on the other thread, a thought occurred:  isn't this the first year that Game Chef's design portion was two weeks long?  That, combined with the huge influx of new people, is a large shift in how things work compared to years past, right?  Maybe there's some evidence here that two weeks is too long, and least for the new participant/long-time participant schism.\n<blockquote>But reading past games, which are linked from the main Game Chef page, is a good way of understanding what the unspoken expectations of past participants are.</blockquote>\nMy biggest point is that I feel folks should either (a) clearly communicate these expectations or (b) stop holding people to them.  The damage is already done this year, but maybe next year there should be a lot less "unspoken".  (As an aside, assuming people will read prior entries is also an unspoken expectation.)  I say this not to be some sort of asshole (though maybe that's how I'll appear in saying it), but in an effort to call out (and hopefully help remove) some of the newbie-unfriendliness that I've seen in Game Chef.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66932/#Comment_66932" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T11:56:58+00:00" title="May  4, 2007 11:56AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>It's not telling people how to design.

It is definitely hard to give super indepth feedback for long games.<br/><br/>At the same time, I wonder how much of that tradition of writing shorter games stems from the older 1 week timeframe as a practical limitation (rather than as an overarching philosophy)... in which case a change in timeframe equates to a change to what is expected (in terms of completeness)?<br/><br/>At any rate, I think that it is ridiculous to <b>expect</b> a first time contestant to need to review all the entries of the  previous years of a contest in order to come up with an understaning of what the "prevailing standards" are... if those standards are not going to be posted anywhere in the rules or even as a guideline.<br/><br/>Game Chef, in my limited experience (mostly lurking), seems to be about creating as complete of a RPG as possible given the time frame. Given a week, you will be getting very short, very focused designs without much "fat". Double that time and you will have more robust designs... and the page length that comes with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66937/#Comment_66937" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T12:11:36+00:00" title="May  4, 2007 12:11PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>At any rate, I think that it is ridiculous to expect a first time contestant to need to review all the entries of the previous years of a contest in order to come up with an understaning of what the "prevailing standards" are... if those standards are not going to be posted anywhere in the rules or even as a guideline.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Definitely.

Then again, I didn't have to read any 40+ page games. Though for that matter, the latest 40 page game I read (Schizonauts), is mostly long because it has so many mechanics, not (again) because of an excess of additional source material.<br/><br/>I really don't see how you are supposed to establish a standard for length based on 'type' of information included -- different games require radically different amounts of information, in different configuration, to be properly explained. My game could have been half as long, but I don't think it would have been at all as effective at presenting the game design. Some other games seem like they could have used <i>more</i> material geared towards establishing a tone and overall direction for the game.<br/><br/>Certainly this 'game design' essentialism makes less and less sense to me, the more it gets repeated. Talysman's implicit claim that you should only submit "a design document" for Game Chef is totally out to lunch based on the rules and all the discussion about games I was exposed to during the contest, where the general idea was that you are supposed to submit "a complete game". Complete, not finished, absolutely -- but the idea that you should be actively stripping out things that you think make your game more complete, because this will somehow make for better presentation... man what?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66968/#Comment_66968" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T20:53:25+00:00" title="May  4, 2007  8:53PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with ICE; my impression of Game Chef was never "just write the rules, they are important."<br/><br/>For many game systems, the "flavor text" is as important as the "rules."

I'd point to Jon Walton and Ben Lehman as people whose designs I read this way (<em>Polaris,</em> for instance, is full of non-accidental stories and details), and I feel that when I do, they are better designs. And you can't ever know without reading an entire game where on that spectrum it falls!</p>\n<p>Similarly, there are designs where particular <em>mechanics</em> aren't really important to the game, like (I would suggest) the particulars of any given loresheet in <em>Weapons of the Gods,</em> or the details of any singular feat in D&amp;D.</p>\n<p>So I don't think that it's very smart reading to choose to privilege one kind of text over another just because some of it is implicit and some of it is explicit. Either way, you are discarding important awareness about how some games work. I think the best thing to do is to be aware of this and try and figure out how a game was designed after reading the whole thing, but if you don't choose to do that, then at least understand that you are creating a blind spot for yourself, and be aware that it has effects.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67014/#Comment_67014" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-06T12:20:05+00:00" title="May  6, 2007 12:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas, I agree 100%.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67017/#Comment_67017" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-06T12:59:33+00:00" title="May  6, 2007 12:59PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I'm not dismissing flavour text per se.

I wrote to my standards of completeness -- a few pages of setting, and then no rule left without a dedicated example, plus a detailed design notes section at the end to give people a perspective on what I was trying to accomplish.  To have done less than this would have been to submit something unfinished.  <br/><br/>For publication, my standards of completeness several leagues beyond that.

There's always plenty of time to flesh out the background.</p>\n<p>The key questions, I would say, are: how much does the reader have to read, and how much information does the reader actually gain? Ideally, you need a couple pages to convey your setting concept, your rules, and your examples. Examples can be skipped, if you understand the rules. So can flavor text, if you feel you get the idea behind the setting.  So can many other kinds of text, as long it's easy to find the rules necessary.</p>\n<p>I'll use my own entry as a bad example. People liked the hippy voice I used when I wrote my game. However, the rules are embedded in this flavor text. Many people did not understand how to play the game, as a consequence. If I had repeated every rule as a pullquote and included a rules summary at the end, as well as more examples, it would have been a better entry. The problem wasn't the length (it's pretty short,) it's the way the text obscures the rules, which makes reading it a chore and makes it seem longer than it is.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67700/#Comment_67700" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T21:09:03+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  9:09PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>"It was said"?<br/><br/>You were responding to me.

For the other challenge, you flesh out an extra nine pages of setting material without any mechanics at all, although you can define things like attributes.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to decide what would be a good next step for each challenge.

Have participants swap, creating rules for someone else's setting, or setting for someone else's rules?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67708/#Comment_67708" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T21:47:20+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  9:47PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, John: For what it's worth, I think we've talked things through to the point where we at least understand one another, even if it's not an eye-to-eye kind of thing.  I would certainly join with you to suggest that game designs should be *efficient* in conveying what they need to convey; I just follow on closely with the assertion that efficiency does not necessarily equal brevity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67715/#Comment_67715" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T22:21:34+00:00" title="May  8, 2007 10:21PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'll agree with that!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67925/#Comment_67925" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T11:57:57+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 11:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 11:58AM by Kynn.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>Fred:No, I'm not criticizing your game.

Which are the games which you're discussing here, if you're not discussing Fred's game?<br/><br/>Because apparently nobody knows what you're talking about. You're probably not even talking about your game, even though you cite it as an example, since you're not one of the "people new to design" you're trying to warn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
