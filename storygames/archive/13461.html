I played a Gadgeteer, and my favorite part was re-skinning my gadget powers, which are basically D&amp;D spells. So the generic "acid arrow" became my German inventor's "Rumpler-Frischmilch Patented Punishment Spray". And it's a powerful weapon until it randomly breaks - so instead of memorizing spells, I have to pay money and spend time tinkering with my gear. Super fun.<br/><br/>We fought a demon from hell, which was pretty interesting since my guy was a man of science, Shane's guy was a rabid Pentecostal preacher, and Remi's guy was Grach, The Jew of Boot Hill.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303571/#Comment_303571" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-07T10:07:38+00:00" title="December  7, 2010 10:07AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco.

In fact, our contract is just to get the rabbit to its destination. Okay!<br/><br/>- Zeke opens comms from Myriad to the Caterwaul. Myriad asks about life support control. There is air pressure throughout the vessel and it is under intermittent control. They are carrying the live specimen and some tools. The live specimen is a "rabbit" which has a special meaning if you're from Fail. And Zofma knows that this is a huge six-legged ungulate with sharp hooves that roams the obsidian plains of Fail. Pretty dangerous, and masses at least a ton.<br/>- We're getting paid a lot. Myriad assesses risk.<br/>- Alison points out that in zero G this thing won't be mustering much of a defense. Still could be dangerous \u2014 a thrashing ton is pretty dangerous. Myriad asks the cargo master for advice. He has no experience with manhandling thousand kilo six-legged ungulates.<br/>- We have CCTV footage of it floating around and kicking. Six legs, long ears, plenty of howling.<br/>- Zeke asks the crew how this happened. They are embarrassed. Someone made a mistake.<br/>- Alison cycles the airlock and brings the EVA team into the ship. He checks out the situation, checking the crew quarters. Zofma checks for booby traps because he's careful that way, using his Demolitions skill. He gets 2 total and things look fine! There are two church officers and three crew; Alison introduces himself, they laugh at the fact that he's a missionary. Condolences, etc. He tries to find out more about the rabbit but they don't have much to offer \u2014 they have been pretty incompetent and don't want to talk about it.<br/>- Alison orders the cargo master to inflate the rescue balls \u2014 they will clog the cargo chute with these and push them down the chute, hoping to force the animal safely into the cargo can.<br/>- We run a sort of zone combat, with each person making MicroG checks to navigate a rescue ball usefully. It kicks around and manages to deflate a ball or two with its sharp hooves and frustrates the effort right near the cargo door. Once there we order the crew to open the exterior cargo door and then close it. The change in air pressure forces the animal into the cargo canister.<br/>- We risk shooting the thing into space. Myriad manages the timing using Profession: Repo Man (this is all standard procedure) and gets a 4, succeeding and avoiding accidentally spacing the beast.

Bro plays Brick Masonry, a Brick + Simple Soul working-class hero, good-hearted, slow-minded and wide and tall as a truck. Buddy plays JusticeBot 2.0, a Robot + Crusader ("like Captain America with expressionless lightup eyes and mouth") created as the ultimate justice-dispensing machine by the intrepid Dr. Falcon. I play The Magistrate, a Godling + Older but Wiser cosmic being, once a hero (and Dr. Falcon's teammate) sent to Earth to understand and judge humanity, but now turned against mankind having judged civilization corrupt.<br/><br/>As the Magistrate marched on City Hall, Brick stood in his way. My brother checked off "Happy" to roll a die, and challenged me with the declaration: "You shouldn't hurt people just because you're sad!"<br/><br/>That became his catchphrase. When Justicebot's sinister new programming kicked in to strike at the Magistrate by invading his underground complex and killing his family (causing me to abandon my goal of "Kill the City Council" in an hurry!) Brick Masonry allied with the alien visitor: "He shouldn't hurt people just because he's sad!"<br/><br/>The Magistrate saved his family, but at great cost, sending them off to the stars in the Cosmic Raft, leaving himself stranded and estranged from them...forever! Then we fought and destroyed the JusticeBot utterly. Brick Masonry's pure-hearted idealism began to teach the Magistrate a newfound respect for humanity, and he proposed an alliance to track down Dr. Falcon himself, Brick readily agreed: "He shouldn't hurt people just because he's sad!"<br/><br/>God, I love Capes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304096/#Comment_304096" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T15:07:13+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  3:07PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On saturday I was a real Dungeon Master for the first time, actually running a dungeon crawl (almost exactly 30 years after the first one!).

It's all in an unknown format, of course. He reports failure. Myriad advises him to do some traffic analysis \u2014 it's transmitting something so maybe the period of transmission matches some exterior event. He's also trying to find recordings of data we have already transmitted to it. All this should get some clues to format and maybe reveal the system a little. Zeke makes a Communications roll and gets a total of 0 (rolls a -3) and decides to tag an aspect for a re-roll. Tags the ship's Military communications system and gets a total of 3 this time. Much better! He also invokes Alison's Quick learner  aspect \u2014 he calls Alison and gets his opinion on it, and Alison determines that there is a mismatched impedence somewhere. Success!
