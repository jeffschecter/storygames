Then I decided to come up with something to play out that dynamic of the shitty housemate. Essentially it's a game where the players (at least 6 maybe?) are divided into two teams and each team represents one of the housemates. They take turns setting up scenes and in those scenes they argue about stuff usually or engage in petty little contests. The players bid coins from a team pool and whoever ends up winning gets to narrate. That's mostly it except I want something to show the relationship degrading and I want there to be a strong likelihood of one housemate snapping and assaulting or killing the other eventually.<br/><br/>The second idea was inspired by the woman I miss. The basic setup is a man is driving across the country to see the woman he loves. It's meant for four players and the role of The Driver cycles around the table. There's a deck of cards with (for lack of a better term) random encounters on them. So the current driver draws a card, frames a scene around it and the other players are the other participants in the scene. But they won't always be people, I want it set up so that sometimes a scene is a radio show he's listening to, or a dream sequence, or a memory, or him imagining what she's doing right now. And for some reason there's a card in the deck that just says "The Assassins Draw Near".<br/><br/>So yeah, that's where I'm at.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216164/#Comment_216164" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T05:43:00+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  5:43AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "She's Worth It" sounds nice, but the random encounters should definitely all end up relating back to Her.

I was torn between having a variety of things going on and how I was going to tie them all back to the theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216343/#Comment_216343" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T05:19:16+00:00" title="July  4, 2009  5:19AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bullbar</cite> They take turns setting up scenes and in those scenes they argue about stuff usually or engage in petty little contests.

I've been looking for a way to sort of... show off the slow degrading of the relationship between them and how things actually happen and the feelings of those involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
