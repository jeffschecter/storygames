This has had the practical effect over the last few years of really opening things up in a way that's really exciting for us on the Jury. Of course, if you have the means and the budget to submit physical copies, it never hurts your chances, but it's no longer a barrier to entry the way it used to be.  The deadline for submission is December 15th, so here' still plenty of time for electronic submissions (and probably some leeway if you let them know you want to send hardcopy samples).<br/><br/>So if you had an original game or supplement that officially released in 2012, please check out the page and consider submitting! Past years have produced winners like the Dresden Files, Burning Empires, and a special award for Do, so there's a strong track record of independent designers and smaller presses doing just fine when stacked against the mainstream. I love it in years when paring down the list of nominees is really hard. Here's your chance to keep me awake at night!<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>(EDIT: I mistakenly recalled that Fiasco had won, but it didn't. Sorry, Jason, I conflated my really wanting it to win that year with it actually happening.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
