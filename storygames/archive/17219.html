If everyone wants worse endings, just try to even out who's getting what dice.<br/><br/>Though <a href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">@Wolfe</a>, it actually isn't possible to get 0 dice because you keep them in Act 2, and you always take 2 scenes in Act 2, so everyone gets at least 2 dice at the end. The structure also makes <del>six</del> the most a single person can have. EDIT: Not six, six is for my three-person games. It's two for every player in the game is the maximum a person can have.<br/><br/>Both of our games ended with the guys playing more to the side of good winning out, but it was sheer dice coincidence that the aftermath supported our ideas. Both times we also got a player with a zero, so I think if you're transparent with the structure and they want to have a horrible (but entertaining) ending for their people, they can strive for that. And the other players will want the good dice for themselves too, so it's not like everyone's gonna give the good dice in the right directions all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390611/#Comment_390611" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T20:18:44+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  8:18PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2012 8:20PM by Stephen P.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The point about playing toward middling dice totals for the epilog is right.<br/><br/>Some of this is also a high-level issue: if you want more death or mayhem, have a pre-game discussion and let everyone know that you think more death and mayhem would be a good thing, and then aggressively frame scenes when it's your turn. Fiasco is a game where you really get out of it what you put it. The more the players use the pre-tilt play to fuck shit up (I think that's the official phrase), the more likely are messy endings.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, one cool thing you can do if you want more death is to try to get your character killed.

I don't think any of my group are playing to win (well, maybe one but she does it so well! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>), quite the opposite in fact. The problem with tactically ensuring everyone gets a good balance of dice is that what makes sense for the game doesn't necessarily work for the story. So, yes, it probably made sense to give E more black dice, but as we came to the ending, it worked to have her escaping the clutches of doom, etc. The key issue is that since no one is that invested in the characters in Act I, it isn't at all apparent how giving someone a black or white die at that stage is going to work out.<br/><br/>Aside from Steve Segedy's point about players just being better at declaring themselves dead (in which case, no aftermath at all?), one idea at the back of my mind was to give all the players the option before the aftermath of giving one of their dice to one of the other players. Maybe that's just a hack our group should use to suit our own style of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390628/#Comment_390628" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T03:37:30+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  3:37AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2012 3:38AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My explanation before play includes a little digression into why die choice matters, and why giving a white die to a player who already has a black die is a flag that you would like to see his character ultimately suffer.

By doing this, they will either be winning or losing consistently in Act 2, and forcing everyone else to increasingly do otherwise. This means that their greed for their own good ending is normally going to make everyone else's ending worse. (It's possible for everyone to collude to make a fully-happy-ending possible for all characters based on who they give dice to in Act 1.)

Even if you roll straight 4's (slightly above average result on each die), you'll wind up with an 8, which beats a 0 or 1 but is (literally) "nothing to write home about."<br/><br/>* You may take a die of one color during your first scene of Act 2, but by the time it gets to your last scene, that die color may be gone, forcing you to take the other color.<br/><br/>* Even if you get an Aftermath roll that is great from a numbers perspective, from a story perspective, you ate still bound by what's already happened in your character's life, much of which was out of your control if you are Resolving a lot of scenes created by others. Your fellow players could say, "Hey, JD, here's your Act 2, scene 2 setup: We are all at your funeral, spitting into the casket the undertaker really should have left closed since you died so horribly." (extreme example, obviously) But many other bad things can happen to characters which could still come into play even in a happy ending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390747/#Comment_390747" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T18:07:32+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  6:07PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, as I say, it's an "almost guarantee".

I ran three games of it last weekend, and between that and the last two times I played, I've only seen one single roll higher than a 7 (it was a 16). I'd almost create a thread saying "Too many bad endings?" :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
