I grew up in a Christian Conservative household in the 80s and 90s so I never even saw a 20-sided die in person till I was in college. I remember spending a large amount of time studying the Advanced D&amp;D ads in my comics though, the Ravenloft ad with Dracula stands out in my mind as a particularly intriguing image. I also remember seeing a GURPs ad and not really understanding what it was talking about. I played Magic in college a handful of times but it never hooked me, I loved looking at the cards and the flavor text, but the game itself wasn't my thing. In 2008, I was 3 years out of undergrad and getting ready for my Master's when I decided to pick up D&amp;D 4e. I'd recently suspended a WoW account because I got bored with it. I find once I figure out the mechanic working underneath a video game or the pattern of progression my attention wanders. With 4e I delved in head first, DM-ing before ever playing it from the other side. I was the only person in my group of friends who was brave enough to take on that role. I screwed up a lot those first few sessions, but I just kept reading up and working on putting together little adventure exercises. I played about two campaigns and by the end of the second one, I was exhausted. I had graduated with my Master's at that point and was now teaching 3rd grade in a public school. I found planning as a DM for 4e was the equivalent of writing lesson plans for my class, and when it was time to relax on the weekends the last thing I wanted to do was write lesson plans for fun. <br/><br/>It was around December of last year that I discovered Microscope and then Fiasco and it all changed from there. I'm a big fan of stand up comedy and improv (Mr. Show and Upright Citizens Brigade in particular) and I saw a lot of improv work present in these game. I fell in love with the idea of GM-less or GM-ful. Finally, I could play for once dammit! More recently, I've come back around to the idea of a GM (through reading Apocalypse content among other things). I also enjoy discovering material outside the fantasy genre. I'm currently running a Primetime Adventures campaign heavily influenced by Twin Peaks and Reddit's NoSleep community. I bought Itras By the other day and can't wait to delve into it. Game Poems are another weird little treat for me. I don't know if I would ever go back to D&amp;D at this point, at least not as a DM. <br/><br/>So that's how I came to be here. Would love to hear from others.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400302/#Comment_400302" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T05:57:15+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  5:57AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My brother saw D&amp;D being played at the high school library back in '79 and was really psyched about it.

I spent hours sitting on the floor in Walden Books at the Southwest Plaza Mall reading Gamma World or the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay career compendium while I waited for my mom to finish shopping. When I was a little older and we weren't playing Phantasy Star on the Sega Master System, my friend Doug and I would frequently reinact scenes from the Rankin and Bass version of the Hobbit or the Ralph Bakshi movie Wizards. Unfortunately, Doug's family moved, and I didn't know any other kids who shared my interests. I completed the aptly titled Lonewolf game books several times by myself. <br/><br/>In middleschool, I saw some kids playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and I was blown away by the weapon drawings and the idea that you could play an animal OTHER THAN A TURTLE!? Amazing. At some point in 8th grade, I saved up and bought Champions; I memorized the ideas of OCV, DCV, NND, RKA, ED, PD, Variable Point Power Pools, and a stunning amount of other minutiae; and, I made about a million characters that I never played. <br/><br/>Toward the end of my Freshman year in highschool, I joined the games club and discovered there were others like me.

When I was 31, I was musing that I didn't have a hobby, and it occurred to me that I had enjoyed gaming once, but I didn't know any adults who played. I wondered if there were grown up gamers -- I also thought there are "indie movies" and "indie music" -- are there indie games? When the internet revealed that there were indeed indie games, I was curious, so I looked up indie rpgs on Meetup.com, and I found the group with whom I have played steadily for almost four years now. <br/><br/>A.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pksullivan" title="pksullivan"><img alt="pksullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pksullivan">pksullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400333/#Comment_400333" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T09:01:23+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  9:01AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was 10, my uncle gave me a copy of Star Wars Adventure Journal <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> as a Christmas gift. I had never heard of role playing before and the book wasn't a rule book. It was a supplement with articles, new items, short stories, and all sorts of stuff related to the game that was not the game itself. There was even a choose-your-own-adventure style story you could roll dice to. I kept my ear to the ground for more about this game but never came across the core rules in person. I eventually bought a copy on eBay a few years ago. D&amp;D 3.0 came out in '99 and I bought a copy of the core books. <br/><br/>My first game was in 2000, the parents of a friend of mine were gamers in college. For his birthday, they brought their college DM into town for a big family game of D&amp;D. Since it was his birthday, he invited me over to play with them. That was an AD&amp;D game. Later than year I started playing in a regular 3rd Ed. D&amp;D campaign with people from another town. I've been gaming ever since. Just a few months ago I finally got a chance to play the old WEG Star Wars game for the first time, 18 years after I got that copy of the Star Wars Adventure Journal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400343/#Comment_400343" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T09:35:46+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  9:35AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>In middleschool, I saw some kids playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and I was blown away by the weapon drawings and the idea that you could play an animal OTHER THAN A TURTLE!?

I was vaguely aware of D&amp;D (the red box) back in grade school, but I didn't play it or even understand what kind of game it was, and no one else seemed interested, so it didn't really mean anything to me. Mostly I spent my time with my Atari and my computer games.<br/><br/>In high school, the guys I hung out with played AD&amp;D2e and invited me to join them, and I spent a good chunk of time doing that. I liked the hanging out with friends, I liked learning the system (something that we all did, both to be more effective and to be able to hack it into doing things it was not meant to do). I wasn't a huge fan of the setting or the kind of game it was or the system, and so it was something that I <i>did</i>, not something I <i>loved</i>.<br/><br/>Then in college, I got to play other games for the first time, and Call of Cthulhu blew my friggin' mind with how much fun it was. And from there, WEG's first edition of Star Wars, Cyberpunk 2020, and eventually the WoD games. Playing a wider variety of games = better gaming. Plus, USENET was a big deal back then, so now I was reading/participating in huge discussions about gaming with people from all over the world, and that had a huge effect on me, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400369/#Comment_400369" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T13:30:38+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  1:30PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2012 1:50PM by Colinaut.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Middle School:</b> Choose Your Own Adventure Books<br/><b>Junior High:</b> Top Secret, AD&amp;D, Car Wars, Chill<br/><b>HighSchool:</b> Chill, Car Wars, Champions, D&amp;D, Shadowrun, Vampire<br/><b>College:</b> Vampire/Werewolf/Mage (including a bit of LARPing), TORG, Kult, Call of Cthulhu, Gammaworld, Paranoia, HOL<br/><i>[huge time gap which included some boardgaming]</i><br/><b>Random on a whim:</b> All Flesh Must Be Eaten, Godlike<br/><i>[another large time gap which included lots of boardgaming]</i><br/><b>Recently after having discovered the awesome world of indie games:</b> Nemesis, Dread, Apocalypse World, Lacuna, Deadlands, Sea Dracula, Fiasco, (with others on my list to play soon)<br/><br/>In many ways, my gaming history has been a voyage of continual discovery through the years as I fade in and out of the hobby, as new games come on the scene, as my tastes change, and as my group of friends shift.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400387/#Comment_400387" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T17:41:29+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  5:41PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started playing a little after 4th Edition came out and when I moved to Korea.

I learned a lot about comedy and improv from listening to the Mr. Show commentaries. A lot of these sketches are developed from a bunch of people sitting around a room dicking around on little ideas, much like my Fiasco sessions with my friends.

I sent off for a catalog, and my younger brother and I started ordering miniatures (just because we thought they were cool).  A one page flier came with one of our orders for a game called Empire of the Petal Throne.  It sounded really awesome, with weird aliens, super technology/magic, and a cool looking map.  I bugged my parents to buy it for me (it was $27.50, which I looked up using an inflation calculator last year to find was the 1976 equivalent of about $100) until they finally relented and got it for me for Christmas that year.  I spent all Christmas day devouring the book, loving the artwork and the weird writing, and trying to figure out how you played it.<br/><br/>When I got back to school after Christmas break, I got some friends together to play.  We really had no idea of what to do, and made tons of mistakes, but had lots of fun.  I went to my first convention that spring (1977), Gencon South in Jacksonville, Florida, and my friends and I were shocked to find that EPT wasn't the only RPG out there, and that lots of people played this game called D&amp;D which we hadn't really heard of.<br/><br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AdamK" title="AdamK"><img alt="AdamK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AdamK">AdamK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400601/#Comment_400601" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-12T12:45:52+00:00" title="December 12, 2012 12:45PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gaming in general started with the Commodore 64 during my kindergarten years. My father had a healthy side-business smuggling C64s into Hungary from Austria and selling them to pawnshops. Those beasts were just too powerful for us socialists to own, so it was put on the CoCom list of military equipment not sold by the Western bloc to non-allied states. Thus the C64 was in high demand on the Hungarian grey market. Anyway, my dad thought he'd invest some of the money he got from smuggling the computers through the border to actually get one for the family. From that time, my older brother and I were glued in front of the television for many hours playing games we didn't understand a single word of.<br/><br/>I left early for high school (I attended a 6 year long high school). One of the last things I remember of primary school is the birthday party of one of my buddies. He tried to play something called MAGUS with us which I later learned was the most successful Hungarian RPG, kind of a darker D&amp;D clone. The party was big and somehow I ended up playing some completely different game during that afternoon, so I left primary school without ever learning what a pen-and-paper RPG is and no chance to get hooked on it for another 5 years.<br/><br/>During high school some of my friends were roleplayers. We played some Star Wars d6 very briefly in the early years but it didn't catch on because playing in the school was forbidden and we didn't have another place to get together in the afternoons. I forgot about it quite quickly and the roleplayers returned to playing in separate groups. While I was already a gamer, roleplaying was still the hack-and-slash action of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nox_%28video_game%29" rel="nofollow">Nox</a> in my mind until the summer of 2001. I was pretty much a sci-fi geek by that time and had influential exposure to fantasy, although still not understanding much of the English dialogue in CRPGs and having no literary experience with the genre. My friends were fans of The Lord of the Rings though and decided that the forthcoming movie adaptation of this classic is worth to be celebrated with a MERP campaign. We started playing MERP quite regularly. After high school was over in 2002, we still kept coming together playing MERP, Star Wars, Oriental Adventures and any other RPG we could get our hands on. My brother and I also started to play D&amp;D3 with college buddies who we thought might find roleplaying interesting which also concluded in friendships still intact.<br/><br/>So in the end it was Peter Jackson deciding to adopt Tolkien's genre-defining epic that got me and by proxy another half dozen of my friends to become roleplayers.<br/><br/>As for how I got here: we entertained the idea of developing our own RPG about mutants running from anti-mutant-surveillance agents for a while and somehow I ended up reading the Forge a lot (no idea how I got there). Story Games was mentioned there around the time of birth of the site and I joined because the threads seemed more interesting than Forge topics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400612/#Comment_400612" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-12T13:54:03+00:00" title="December 12, 2012  1:54PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went looking for it.<br/><br/>I heard whispers and rumors about gaming, so I made up games based on what I heard and quested for more information that would fill in the gaps of my knowledge.

And I'm a nerd, so I've always been kind of aware that pencil-and-paper RPGs were a thing. At a con a couple of years back, I picked up a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons red box, looking maybe to run a game but also kind of just so I could say I'd read D&amp;D, you know?<br/><br/>So I read it, and I found it a bit... not what I wanted. I'm not really a fan of high fantasy at the best of times, to be honest, and something about D&amp;D left me cold. Can't quite explain it.<br/><br/>But it's really all John Rogers' fault. Rogers is one of my favourite writers - he's head writer on Leverage, and he's got a really great blog about writing. Just as I was getting into Twitter, he tweeted that he'd just backed a Kickstarter for something called Our Last Best Hope.<br/><br/>I went on over, checked it out. It was like an RPG but not like an RPG in all the ways that D&amp;D made my brain hurt, and Kickstarter is pretty addictive, and it turned out I could get a copy of the book pretty cheap...<br/><br/>Well, if that hadn't hooked me, the next bit would. I emailed Mark, who wrote OLBH, suggesting that the system would be pretty cool for running a superhero game - the structure of The Avengers is pretty close to a disaster movie. And then he asked me if I wanted to write it as a supplement for the companion book, so I went kicking around the Internet to find out a little more about this whole story games thing... And I've basically been here ever since.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400637/#Comment_400637" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-12T20:16:52+00:00" title="December 12, 2012  8:16PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was reading The Hobbit in 1979 when a friend's older brother brought home blue box D&amp;D.

In junior high, I looked at D&amp;D on the shelf, and went with Tractics instead.<br/><br/>Then in fall of 1977 my best friend had a weekend birthday party. Friday evening he opened presents. One of his presents was the Holmes Basic D&amp;D boxed set. I decided to watch that evening, but started reading the rules while my friend DMed. I stayed up all night reading the rules.<br/><br/>Saturday morning I invited everyone to roll up characters. Oh, and I was already hacking rules (*). It didn't make sense to me that weapons all did the same damage. Having no basis, I suggested that damage be based on the cost of the weapon (to which point, someone asked if they could use a warship - being the most expensive item on the price list). I forgot what my ruling in the end was on weapon damage.<br/><br/>The players launched into the dungeons of Geomorph populated with monsters and treasure from the realms of Monster and Treasure Assortment (in 1977, the boxed set came with a set of Dungeon Geomorphs and Monsters and Treasure Assortment not a module). We continued playing all day, sitting in the back of my friend's mom's station wagon on the way to and from Battleship Cove (which was the intended feature of the weekend, we did enjoy it, but D&amp;D definitely took over the weekend). In the end, I think we ran through several sets of PCs after they attained 4th level and ran off the end of the rules.<br/><br/>Of course I was hooked.<br/><br/>My gaming really kicked off when I was invited to go to one of MITSGS's conventions and the friend who invited me had lined up 16 players before I finished registering and making my way to a table. Poor little shy Frank... I managed, I managed so well a couple of the older guys complimented me and suggested I should start coming to MITSGS on Saturdays, which I proceeded to do.<br/><br/>Frank<br/><br/>p.s.<br/><br/>(*) I should note I actually had been hacking wargame rules. Not too long after getting Tactics II, I remember designing an alternate game board. I also tried my hand at game design with a game depicting the events of April 19 1775 (with the game board literally drawn on a pine board...). I also remember looking at some of the wargame rules before I got Tractics and thinking slope of armor should be a factor. Sometime in 1975 or so, we started getting together with my mom's best friend's family to play games. I ended up doing some wargame playing with their oldest son (which in retrospect is interesting I didn't get introduced earlier to MITSGS considering he was president of the club (not necessarily at that time - and maybe he wasn't in college yet) - the real funny thing was when I was in grad school at RPI and he became a professor and joined my Cold Iron campaign).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400700/#Comment_400700" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T13:55:37+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  1:55PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By gaming, I'll assume role playing games.<br/>I'm not sure how old I was, but I think I first played Tom Moldvay's Dungeons and Dragons?  <br/>It never took. <br/>I mean, playing pretend took, but D&amp;D didn't for whatever reason. <br/>It's still hard for me to wrap my head around role playing games, after how many years of playin' 'em.<br/>Anyway, a few years after that I got Marvel Super Heroes.

I was about 9, we were visiting family friends in G\xf6teborg and I wound up kind-of playing some form of D&amp;D in their rec room in Swedish-Norwegian-English.  I think it was a gloriously sunny day outside, but this was a life-changing experience for me.  Not sure how much actual gaming happened, but the books were magical in how they opened a door to another world.  I was reading Tolkien at the time, I believe.  Second time, a short while later, I played an Elf named Legolas, with Magic Missile in a one-shot.<br/><br/>Red box was what I first owned and for years the hobby was mostly lonely fun- mapping dungeons, making characters (so many characters), buying D&amp;D boxes, AD&amp;D rulebooks and settings that never saw any play.  Gaming became more regular at University- Shadowrun, Champions, AD&amp;D Dragonlance, Pendragon, Mage, and so on.  To this day I continue to buy more games than I've ever played.  I've always enjoyed reading RPG rulebooks.  In the post-uni fallow period, I totally lost my confidence on GMing, until introduced to games with support and a structured GM role a few years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Greg%20Pogor" title="Greg Pogor"><img alt="Greg Pogor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Greg%20Pogor">Greg Pogor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400778/#Comment_400778" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T02:50:09+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  2:50AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My parents got me <b>Star Wars : the Roleplaying Game</b> for christmas because I was really into choose-your-own-adventure books and they thought it was one \u2014\xa0my dad thumbed through the thing and saw the solo play introduction, and it was it.

The following years my brother solo played a whole campaign with me, and I sometimes even got to play with him and his friends. It felt magical.<br/><br/>I got into my first group with friends of the same age, seven years later, when I was fourteen.

The cover of FF7 struck me as really cool so we grabbed it once, and I quickly became enthralled by it. I did research on what was up with the game, and the magazines called it an RPG. My first thought was cool, apparently "Rocket Propelled Grenades" become a big part of this game later on......I was 12. I later found out what RPG stood for, and became addicted to that form of video game. <br/><br/>A couple of years later I am in a store at the mall that has all sorts of toys, board games, and fantasy trinkets. I saw a large corner of the store that said RPG's above it. I had a ton of books which I was only recently aloud to read (yes, was not allowed to read books until I was about 14), and a massive diorama of little figures fighting, and a little sign that Dungeons and Dragons. So I did as much research on this thing as I could, on my archaic dial up, and decided I must have it. "It is is the devil," according to my mother, so that had to wait until I moved out. Fortunately I moved out when I was 15, not the best childhood as you might have been able to tell. <br/><br/>My girlfriends sister was really getting into a MUD that her other college age friends were developing (the Patterns End), and invited her to play a game of DnD, but they needed more players. And so my journey began.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401043/#Comment_401043" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T02:23:04+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  2:23AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got into roleplaying via a freeform RPG on a Lego Bionicle fansite, where they used to run a big ongoing world every year. So I was aware that RPGs were a thing from fairly early on.<br/>... I remember shortly after getting really into Star Wars, doing a google search, expecting something similarly freeform and saw this big thick hardcover book instead. Where you could totally tell your own Star Wars stories. Well I thought that was pretty intense, and then found a copy of the book (The Wizards D20 Star Wars). I tried to run a game via a PbP on a forum, it was awful, not least because I did not know how to obtain a 20 sided dice and so used a cut pack of cards as a randomiser. It got left on the shelf but, fired up with the knowledge that maybe I shouldn't have tried to run a game, I went to see if there were people who knew what they were doing!<br/>But I went into a gaming shop and there were no games recruiting except for one game of Wraith. When I was about 11-12.<br/><br/>I took a break from RPGs for a few years after that. When I was over at my cousin's they found an old blue box set in the attic, and were curious as to what it was. Lording it over them with my knowledge of 'having seen D&amp;D on the Wizards website when I bought Star Wars so it should be the same game basically' we got immensely confused very quickly, but not confused enough to not pick up the latest edition... And it kind of snowballed from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401263/#Comment_401263" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-19T15:07:47+00:00" title="December 19, 2012  3:07PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started playing in 7th grade.  Nothing special really, the school district had multiple elementary schools but only one junior high, so I just met more kids that I hadn't known before.<br/><br/>A couple months after I started playing, my half-brother came to stay for the weekend.  I mentioned my new hobby and he said he'd give me his old books.  He came back with a near complete collection of AD&amp;D hardcovers, probably 40-50 dragon magazines and a large number of adventures.  Of course this just got me used to having a large collection, so when 2nd edition came out I proceeded to do whatever I could to acquire everything, including some juvenile delinquency.  It was a phase that quickly passed though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
