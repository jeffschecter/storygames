He's probably very organized about it. You just know that he irons his shirts, and puts everything neatly on hangers in his closet. He'll do your laundry, too, if you can't. He reads the washing instructions on the label, and he always folds everything just right.<br/><br/>Peter Parker does his own laundry, too, but it's always in a state of complete desperation. He's the guy in the laundromat wearing mismatched socks, a too-small t-shirt, and sweatpants with paint stains and holes, scrabbling at the bottom of his laundry bag looking for just one more quarter, c'mon, please, twenty-five lousy cents for the dryer, that's all I need, just this once can something please go my way? Plus, he probably has to leave before the load is finished, and then come back and beg the manager to let him have his clothes back.<br/><br/>Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark have heard of laundry, but have never done it. Not because they can't, mind you -- it's laundry, of course they can master it -- but because having someone else take care of that stuff is easier and gives them more time to do the things they actually care about. If they were ever trapped at home with nothing to do but laundry, they would do the HELL out of it. Tony would redesign the washer and dryer, Bruce would master t-shirt folding. They both care about doing things as well as they can possibly be done, but only within the area of their current obsession. Mundane little stuff like laundry is the kind of thing they happily pay someone else to deal with.<br/><br/>But at no point are the actual mechanics of doing laundry ever important or interesting; we don't need to make rolls or have a mechanic in place to handle separating delicates from permanent press or anything like that. We just like that character beat that says "This is the kind of person I am." As such, I don't know that there's any game that would handle this particularly well -- any game where at any point people can take a moment to do something mundane with their characters would do just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403260/#Comment_403260" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-09T17:13:35+00:00" title="January  9, 2013  5:13PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2013 5:16PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't know that the <i>actual handling</i> of ordinary situations is all that interesting for extraordinary characters, but revealing how they handle ordinary situations is definitely interesting when it says something about the kind of person they are.</blockquote>\nI loved this post. Awesome stuff.<br/><br/>I think it's important what sort of game you're thinking about.<br/><br/>If you want a serious game, and it's seriously about someone like Superman, then how does he get his laundry done probably isn't a compelling enough question to put extended time into. It's the sort of thing that can be either a side detail (Lois spends the night and finds that Superman has cleaned and pressed her clothes by the time she gets up in the morning.) or as a Monsterhearts style provocative question that leads to other things ("Who does your laundry, Supes?" "Well, I have my Clark Kent shirts and suits pressed at a laundromat run by this nice old Korean couple." "Ah, well when you get your suits back this week, you find {insert plot element here}")<br/><br/>If you want more of a satirical or comedy game, then completing mundane tasks is great stuff. I ran a Mystery Men inspired game for a while, and trying to accomplish basic mundane tasks and fight petty crime all while being pretty much an incompetent goofball was the primary subject matter of the game. Any lightweight task resolution focused generic system (like Savage Worlds) would do the trick. Or something like PTA, depending on how you want it to feel.<br/><br/>Or go gonzo and use something like Project Ninja Panda Taco, with the drift that it be about accomplishing something mundane rather than a plan to take over the world.<br/><br/>Or look through the playset thingys for Hillfolk. There's craploads of those planned. There's probably one close to this, if DramaSystem looks like it's the sort of feel you'd like. It might work very well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403261/#Comment_403261" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-09T17:26:51+00:00" title="January  9, 2013  5:26PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Smallville takes an interesting orthogonal approach to this sort of task, which might be fruitful. In that game it's never really about how good you are at doing any particular type of task, it's always about WHY and FOR WHOM you are trying to accomplish it. <br/><br/>So whether you want your clothes to look good because you want to show Lois how much she means to you or because you want to get back at Lex for how he made you look bad last week is the main thing determining what you'll roll.
