<p>Okay, a show of hands. When was the last time you had a preacher show up in a game with a dark vengeful past and/or ability with guns and/or secret murderin' powers? When was the last time you had a preacher show up WITHOUT these facets? Do you notice that the former crop up much more frequently than the latter?</p>
<p>Seriously now. What's up with the PwG phenomena?</p>

                            LOL... yep, sure enough my NEMESIS: Dark Tower playtest had just such a preacher.<br/><br/>It's iconic.  To be honest this is what surprised me about the preacher in the series, Deadwood.  It was such a departure from the genre.<br/><br/>years agao I played a LARP preacher that didn't have guns and was a bit of a change of pace.  he did have powers but that was probably due to his vampirism.  He was righteous and hella-crazy!                        </div>

                            Could it be that RPGs are generally about the murderin'?  You probably get fewer of these guys in, say, Dead Inside or Breaking the Ice.  Or even TSOY, I'd venture, which can address faith with a little maturity easily enough.<br/><br/>I was hoping this was a Dogs thread (grin).                        </div>

                            You know, it has been a running joke that I, as a player, will cycle through preacher characters of some sort pretty regularly (in D&amp;D, yes, that's a cleric).  There was a long-standing TORG game I played in where, it was pointed out to me, every other character I played was a priest of some sort (yeah, let's bracket why I had the chance to go through this cycle in a single campaign).  I never, ever, went the preacher with guns route. No dark powers, no shiny guns.  Just good ol' love and miraculous Jesus-driven healin' powers. <br><br>I just don't get or much enjoy the PwG.  I remember when someone loaned me the Preacher comic, I was all "WTF--this has some neat ideas if the writer could stop shooting people in the face and actually explore some humanity."  When I watched the series wind-up of Buffy, it just added to the eye-roll worthiness of the whole thing for me.  <br/><br/>Part of it surely has to do with the murderin' element Jason mentioned, but I wonder if it is a tendency to assume that gritty is somehow more real than not gritty--that there must be some dark secret behind anyone who would get behind 'clean' faith.  Kewl powerz and guns just being the visible manifestation of that.                        </br></br></div>

My theory is that it just has to do with the overflowing coolness that is Clint, whose presence exceeds every role in which he enters, demanding that it be re-embodied again and again in different fictional incarnations.                        </div>

                            The type shows up because its a powerful type. <br/><br/>Seriously, it shows the very ambiguous ties in the American psyche between religion, violence, individuality, and redemption at the barrel of a gun. It contrasts the peaceful face of Christianity's midwestern exterior with its past of brutality and repression, and does so in the context of fringe elements of the occult, secret combinations, and the kind of full-bloody heroic spirituality that scares and compells most North Americans with its horrific and yet foundational world view. <br/><br/>It also shows up often because its such an easy type. <br/><br/>A priest who kills! It's such a simplistic juxtoposition that, like Snake Gandhi, it doesn't take a lot to get some kind of juice out of it. He has faith and yet he uses a gun! Oh nos! It's also, as some have pointed out, a motif that has been done in enough in movies and novels to have some cultural capital attached to it, without having been quite as overdone as the vampire with the katana (and being less rediculous besides). So, when looking for an easy thing... <br/><br/>Plus, it's easy in an RPG context. Real faith isn't something many RPGs deal well with, and power from faith has mostly only been tangible in games in so much as it lets you kick more ass. So, having a priest who kicks ass and thus lets you be religious and still "get to the point" (killing shit and taking its money) is a real sweet spot for a lot of RPG play.<br/><br/>In a related note, what about the position of priests in CoC or Conspiracy of Shadows games? How often does the type fall into either "saintly one who resists the evil with their inner brightness and inhuman purity" or "scary fuck who may or may not be corrupted but has to be played in the TV series by Anthony Hopkins because he's just so damn intense and excorcist style scary?"                        </div>

<p>Brand: very interesting.</p>
<p>I think the "preacher with gun" thing also can be a player license for getting into a "just war" or righteous vengeance mindset. To be clear, I think this mindset is <strong>really, really terrible in the real world</strong>. (Why is an exercise for the reader.) But, for many people, the just vengeance thing is really satisfying to watch in a fiction. With PwG, you're almost always two scenes away from being pushed Too Far and enacting some entertaining and morally comfortable badassery.</p>

                            Dev, <br/><br/>Ayup. <br/><br/>Plus its an easy path to take for someone who wants a heroic religious experience. Really, the dark preacher with killing powers is just the Americanized version of the Paladin. Like Roland meets Owen Porter Rockwell.<br/><br/>Which, when I think about it, makes me want to play a modern D&amp;D game in which every single Paladin is the scarriest mother fucker on earth. Not because of the killing powers, but because they really honestly believe in a modern context that they can sense evil and have the moral decree to kill it dead. You know, Dogs in Los Angeles.

                            Crap, Brand, I think you just pointed out something big for me about my ambivalence to the symbolic substratum of the society in which I live.  I had the higher order differences pretty firmly fixed in my head, but this connects those to a more visceral break.  I have to go put that in my thinking pipe and smoke it for a little while...                        </div>

                            I'm thinking of two recent "preacher with guns" characters I've played, one in <i>Dogs</i>, one in <i>a|state</i>.<br/><br/>Brother Zebedee believed that his job was to kill people so that regular people wouldn't have to. Someone had to do it, or the Faithful would fall into sin and suffering. It was a terrible, awful, horrible responsibility and would probably end badly for him - and for sure a lot of people would hate and fear him - but that's what the King needed him to do.<br/><br/>Deacon Penitence was raised from infancy to be a church militiaman. He broke when confronted with real faith, and ended up devoting himself to defending the schismatic parish he'd been sent to pacify. He knew he was already damned for his sins, but if murder is the only thing you know how to do, better to murder them as deserve it.<br/><br/>I guess they're both really about means and ends, and not so much whether ends can justify means, but "what does it do to you when you know that your means are evil, and you believe that your ends are good, but they're the only means you have, and the other guy's ends are really bad?"                        </div>

                            Well, trying to come up with archetypes for religious characters off the top of my head, drawing mainly from Christian themes:<br/>
<br/>
The Martyr - sacrificing themselves for something bigger<br/>
The Crusader - kicking ass for the Lord<br/>
The Penitent - self-flagellation, physical or emotional<br/>
The Fallen - used to have faith, but has become corrupted or disillusioned<br/>
The Disciple of Love - turn the other cheek, be nice to each other, follow the example of Christ<br/>
<br/>
Now in a roleplaying game, the Martyr is going to have a rather short story arc, the Disciple of Love will rapidly turn into a Martyr or become disillusioned (and Fallen). The Penitent and the Fallen often co-exist with each other or the Crusader, but has also been pretty much subsumed by emo/goth stereotypes.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas the Crusader (with or without other archetypes) gets to kick ass, and live to kick ass for another day, and excels at mission-based play. He or she is also inherently proactive - and hence popular.<br/>
<br/>
I'm shooting the shit a bit here, but I think there's something to this.                        </div>

Also, compare "When was the last time you had a preacher show up in a game with a dark vengeful past and/or ability with guns and/or secret murderin' powers?" with "When was the last time you had a character of any type show up in a game with a dark vengeful past and/or ability with guns and/or secret murderin' powers?"

<i>Do Mullah's count? </i><br><br>This is something I thought about, but it doesn't feel like the same cultural archetype or even a close relative.  Clearly, they are related in important ways, but they don't seem to invoke the same sort of faith model.  The preacher with gun often appears as having an incredibly personal, unmediated relation with his God that has been conditioned by a certain sort of Protestantism.  <br><br>One of the PwG's defining traits is that they are loners, containing a power unto themselves.  My (albeit quite limited) exposure to the MwG archetype is that it tends to have a real social tail, that it is articulated with a group.  Moreover, it is often not as the face of the group, the one pulling the trigger, but as its head, giving marching orders to its group.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Consider this: In Deadlands, the preacher types are the easiest characters to abuse in play, because the restrictions on abuse of their power is pretty vague.

                            Brand--<br/><br/>This is interesting, let me see if I can articulate a little more clearly the 'world' evoked by the PwG (here I'm going a little academic, so some might want to tune out).  The PwG seems to owe a lot to a frontier mentality, a world where the next town over may be too far to offer any help or aid if things go bad.  The preacher comes in, too, without clear ties to any of these other towns, he is 'of the wilderness,' touched by its danger and anonymity.  He clearly has ties to the Old Testament prophets in this regard, but unlike them he does not simply speak of God's impending punishment, he inflicts it himself.<br/><br/>Structural variations abound--the way in which the 'postmodern' PwG emerges from the anonymity of the modern city, in which his wilderness is the collapse of community, for example.  But the core remains--from outside, from nowhere in the sense that he lacks a community capable of naming and positioning him (he has no papers to be put in order), he speaks in God's name, he invokes and brings about the judgment.  <br/><br/>When 'secret murderin' powers' come into play, he acquires a second layer of complexity--because he is unfixed, because he has no earthly authority that certifies his powers as holy, they intensify the ambiguity already at work in the type--namely, is this man really holy or does he draw inspiration from something more diabolical?  This seems to tie in with your earlier point about occultism and the PwG and summons to the foreground an anxiety about our knowledge of divinity.  It's veritably Kierkegaard-ian, is this true faith or madness?  Just writ in big letters.<br/><br/>More powerfully, by firmly binding his spiritual and worldly power, the type pointedly raises questions about the moral ground of any power.  Do the people he judges obey out of love/fear of the divine, or simply fear for this particular man here?<br/><br/>Of course, the question can only be asked or answered if the community subjected to the PwG *buys* the faith upon which he depends.  Otherwise, the powerful question disappears and he almost immediately becomes a sort of diabolical power.  Which is all to say that the PwG can only be a PwG in his own world, otherwise he becomes a madman.  The MwG is the correlate of the PwG only for someone to whom the M is a real moral authority.  An MwG *can't* be a PwG for me.  Or, rather, as myself--I could totally see how an MwG could work for me if that were properly prepared for me by the game setting.<br/><br/>Roleplaying wise, from the 'inside' of the type, there are at least two ways to experience the PwG as a character--as a fun chance to be the moral authority, to just take for granted that you are right, come hell or high water.  The second is to play it as a pointed question, to stress the ambiguities, to feel them out.  Of course, you can also play it at least one more way if you are willing to push the double-consciousness: to play the character as moral authority 'from the inside' while being sure 'in your own mind' that they are quite the opposite.  <br/><br/>A range--the second seems the most intense and honest since it frames the dialogical component of the rpg, that the player is conversing with the character, engaging in a sort of running free indirect discourse.                        </div>

                            Ian, <br/><br/>I'm agreeing with much of what you're saying. I'd add to it that there is actually a lot more dialogue going on in the structure than just that. We're getting into real carnival of voices stuff here, with not just player and character interacting, but multiple levels of player, culture, other players at the table, character, and the surrounding culture going on. As multiple folks have pointed out on this thread the plethora of ideas enmeshed in the archetype are not always easily unpackable -- from ideas of masculinity, priesthood, faith, authority, and violence (all of which are pretty central to the American psyche and held in a stern and endless war with secularism, individuality, responsibility, and feminism) it quickly becomes not just one voice, but many and all talking from different angles. <br/><br/>The reason I brought up the Mullah in the first place is because we'd been talking about non-white PwGs, and my point there was that the Mullah is an interesting case in that field because in many ways in its home field the violent mystic/preacher has a long and very similar backgrounding in some eastern countries. The Persian folk-loric emphasis upon the true visionary who comes out of the hostile wilderness uncontaminated by decadent civilization, with a burning vision of world truth that he then imposes upon the world with either prayer or sword (usually both) reads very much like the PwG, but just with cool pointy toed shoes rather than cowboy boots. <br/><br/>Which is where it becomes interesting, in that whole cavalcade of voices, that your first response to the MwG was "bad man sending his minions off to die for him." Because that is very much one perspective on the issue, one of the voices in the world that is right now speaking very loudly and with a whole lot of guns on its side. But there are reasons why a lot of folks are drawn to Osama, and one of them is because he fits an archetype from their PoV â€“ an archetype of the desert priest who fights against power no matter the odds because God has commanded him and he must obey. Combine that with a little bit of hashassin mythology, andâ€¦. <br/><br/>That's about where it hits the exploding point too. See, no matter how conflicted the North American view of Christianity and all its divisions and indecisions, no matter how much we might be compelled and fascinated by the image of the white man with the gun and the authority of God, its still something that is an "our problem" in a lot of the voices going on. But change "white man with a gun and the authority of God" to "brown man with a gun and the authority of Allah" and all of a sudden you're facing a different beast. <br/><br/>It almost doesn't matter how structurally the same they are, how much the frontier town, desert nomad background, hostility of the world, fighting the savage Indian/Indian, secret killing powers and division between secular life and religious vision are. In all those ways the two really are very close to each other. But change "white" to "brown" and "God" to "Allah" without changing anything else, and you're going to be playing a different game. Not because the structure is different, but because you've flipped the simple switch of "us" and "them" for a lot of those voices that cluster around the table. <br/><br/>Or, for that matter, leave "white" but change it to "woman" and "Hecate" and push it to the same extreme and see where you end up. But even there, with all the friction between man and woman, pagan and Christian, those that say there is a war and those that say there isn't... I don't know that it would be the same. After all, the cradle of the best and the worst isn't at war with Hecate.                        </div>

                            Brand--<br/><br/>Total agreement--it's why I raised the whole issue with the PwG functioning differently when those 'at the table' don't have a lot of 'real-life' buy-in to the PwG's beliefs (double consciousness).  As soon as I start playing MwG, it's gonna be an entirely different ballgame than me trying to play a PwG.  Similarly, as soon as you start bringing in other 'real-life' buy-in issues, things will get real wild--because, I suspect that someone playing an MwG who has some serious buy-in to an M's authority, will *also* bring the real-life context of M's place in the modern world. <br/><br/>And rock on with your Leonard Cohen self : )                        </div>

                            This sounds like a very American discussion to me.<br/>
For me, the Preacher With a Gun is The Medieval Inquisitor, or the Fire and Brimstone Medieval Preacher (who was a soldier before he heard The Call) who just happens to have a gun because the game is set in modern times. It's the Missionary who goes out to bring civilisation to the heathen, and is a practcial sort who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty.<br/>
<br/>
Clint is cool, but I think the archetype is much older.<br/>

                            To me (as a non-American) the PwG looks like an avatar of America - or at least of one America, the one that believes it dominates by moral authority but actually dominates by having a big weapon. There are lots of Americas.<br/><br/>But Darren is right, it goes further back in western civilization - pretty much back to Constantine, I suppose, with roots further back in every religion that glorified its god by killing the unbelievers.<br/><br/>Makes me want to found another thread on national avatars, but I'm not sure how interesting it would be. Particularly since mine would be the farmer who helps his neighbour fix his water pump with No. 8 fencing wire.                        </div>

<p>I have played PwGs. My last one, it might be noted, would have eschewed guns as his faith got stronger; the system (a drifted FUDGE--gad, I wish we'd had Fate back then) allowed it.</p>
<p>I love ass-kicking preachers and other such ethical/faithful folk. It's hard to show in movies, and very hard (until recently) to do in games. Do some reading on nonviolence, and you might realize, with requisite chills down the spine, just how powerful it can be. Everyone knows about Gandhi, and I often get into arguments about how what he did was a unique historical moment, couldn't have done it without media exposure of the day, blah blah blah. I call bullshit, because other people continue to do it all the time. (That military coup in Russia, the one that failed? It failed because of <em>trained, prepared</em> nonviolent action.) It's just that nonviolence makes <em>crappy news copy</em>. It's also hard, but not impossible, to write. Or to write <em>well</em>, anyway.</p>
<p>On the cultural note, I'm not really seeing how the ass-kicking monks in so much Asian cinema are that much different from our PwG archetype. Same pitch: "he's a <em>monk</em>! Who <em>kicks ass!</em>" OK, less of the tortured past stuff, and usually in a more defensive, less punitive role, but c'mon, they're plenty violent.</p>
<p>My character (who I must go make up now) in Spirit of the Century (go buy it! now!) is going to be a Thai ex-monk in the royal line, a Resolve (SotC's closest match for faith) monster who doesn't have to resort to guns. Happily, in SotC, except for range, fists are literally as effective as guns. So he gets to beat down folks, he just won't kill them. Woo!</p>

                            To go for a much shallower analysis (and to resurrect a fascinating thread): there is the simple appeal of the costume. Every PwG of whom I can think wore the black suit and collar. The protagonists of romantic ultraviolence in American cinema are always donned in outfits of clean black and white. The less extreme "action hero," by contrast, has a working-class aesthetic. I'm not quite sure what this means, exactly, but I'm sure one could write a whole paper on the class symbolism of it.                        </div>

                            I would just like to add that Jesse Custer from the Preacher comic doesn't really fit this stereotype. He is not a man of the faith and he hates God. He was just a preacher at the beginning of the story because his evil inbred grandma made him. <br/>

                            No, Jesse is totally an instance of the stereotype. He's American masculinity balled up into a big bowl of self-righteousness and subsumation into a cause, and he runs around casting judgement everywhere he goes. The force of his Authority is even physicalized.                        </div>

                            Non-white PwG's?  Monsignor Martinez from "King of the Hill?"  Or, on a more serious note, Nat Turner, who got visions from God inspiring him?<br/>
<br/>
But, I do tend to think that some of the discussion here may have passed over some of the deeper veins of this-I certainly can't think of this character without invoking John Brown-I mean, looking at the picture at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/nystrom/images/Antietam/pages/page_17.html, I certainly can't get a more vivid PwG picture in my head, with or without Clint Eastwood.  For the darker side, Robert Mitchum in "Night of the Hunter" stays with me more strongly than any Eastwood thing.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I think that both sides of this are hugely and deeply American, some kind of reflection of a national conviction that one man's ability to stake everything on his conscience is the greatest and most terrible thing around.  That's not too well said, but I may try to push it harder in a second.                        </div>

<p>One direction I wanted this thread to go in, and perhaps it still could: Rabbis with Guns. I'm serious, and I am <em>not</em> interested in turning it into a joke. I'd ask those of the Jewish persuasion: what would it mean for you if a rabbi figure in fiction chose to pick up a tool of vengeance? (Do note I have ignorance about the details of Judaism myself.)</p>

                            Well, non-practicing Jew that I am, I feel obliged to point out that there were "Judges" in the Old Testament that wielded both divine authority and the means to back it up. Samson and Gideon come to mind. Ditto for Elijah. Although the Judges didn't really "judge" the Jews. God's physical wrath against the sinners is almost never manifest in the prophet/judge; looks like God likes using external means to punish his "chosen people" - plagues and enemies seem to be most popular. The only time I remember this happen in the OT is during the times of the Golden Calf, and that was before the Jews really *were* chosen. <br/>
<br/>
Rabbis with Guns, therefore, don't go well in the Jewish worldview as I see them. (Turning these guns on the heathens, OTOH... this worked more than once.) <br/>

                            I had a lovely PC in a high-powered superhero game I used to run:  He was a Church of England minister who discovered the Holy Grail and became possessed by the spirit of Sir Perceval, becoming The White Knight -- clad in spectral armour and armed with an energy sword whose touch caused evildoers to repent of their sins.<br/>
<br/>
What was neat about the character was that the player handled him as a genuinely devout, concerned man with some real morality.  The player, a really good friend of mine, is hardcore atheist-humanist whereas I am lapsed Scots Presbyterian.  We had a lot of fun framing up scenes which challenged the character's faith and morality.<br/>

There was also good interaction between this character and another PC, who was playing a genuine pagan god, exiled to Earth in mortal form.  Fun theological discussions all around.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of the actual archetype Dev is talking about, I've only run into it once -- playing in a Deadlands game.  That game was ... um ... not very good.  Basically it was a kind of spaghetti western with rubber monsters take on the setting and there was very little attempt to take anything seriously or do much more than wait around for the next GMPC or random firefight to show up.  The other PCs were ... thinks ... an omnicompetent US Marshall and and oh-so-secret secret agent.  Even my "kid on the run from an abusive past" never really found a way to express anything resembling interesting character or psychology.                        </div>

                            Re: Rabbis with Guns, actually there's an OT law that refers to dealing with a town that strayed wholly from the faith. Something about destroying it wholly by sword and by fire, slaying every living thing in it, and never building it again. Not a very nice law. Then again, it had never been carried out.                        </div>

<p>The computer adventure game "Shivah" features a sort of two-fisted, hard-boiled rabbi, albeit unarmed. Quite fun if you like the old-style King's Quest games, and hey, it's five bucks. I hope the guy makes a bigger sequel.</p>
<p>It's at <a href="http://www.manifestogames.com/node/1807" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manifestogames.com/node/1807</a>. I played the whole thing through in an evening, but I did cheat a teeny bit.</p>
