A lot depends on how you view anime: is your cultural interest in "anime roleplaying" best satisfied by a game that attempts to simulate all recognizable geek anime cliches with point-buy powers? I do believe that anybody who wants a rpg system to have a solid character spec, but otherwise get out of the way of the GM's campaign, and who doesn't mind the system being somewhat less robust than say GURPS (in terms of power-gamers trying to break it, I mean), could well enjoy it.<br/><br/>That being said, the sense I got from the first edition was that it's something of a labor of love, and despite the derivate nature, basically an artistically independent effort. These are reasons to believe that the new edition could be potentially quite different, as the author has presumably developed to some direction in his roleplaying hobby, and there are no obvious reasons for why the game wouldn't follow suit.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
