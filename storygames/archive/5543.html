I think it can't be done. To wit--Jason, Remi, Clinton and Joe do it all the time, but I think that they are doing something very different. They are all acting as the GM.  Of course, I haven't watched them in action (though I did play once with Clinton and Dave Younce) but I have these suspicisions that they:\n<ul>\n<li>Take strong opposition to one another's best interests</li>\n<li>Have an overarching plot that threatens everyone and keeps the plot ticking along</li>\n<li>Watch out for where other npc can fit into the structure of putting pressure on eachother via best intersts</li>\n<li>And don't let up</li>\n</ul>\nI talked with several folks who played Wicked without one person functioning as the GM per se at Dreamation, and from what they said, it was very problematic.  Just opposing one another's best interest leaves you in the lurch once one or the other person succeeds:  okay, I've made you marry me, now what? Your interest is wiped out and the tension there is resolved. What keeps the plot humming? <br/><br/>The role of the GM in Wicked is to 1) identify strong lines of conflict evoked by the situation brainstorming to galvanize the player characters and then 2) to use the npcs to keep the pcs hopping in that or another direction. All of the player characters also have their own agendas that they bring to bear on one another and the main adversity, but unless everyone is paying attention to keeping all of those lines of tension taught, or there is one person whose job it is to do so, you run a strong risk of having the game flop around on the table.  <br/><br/>Polaris style structures might really do good things.<br/><br/>best,<br/>Em                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124303/#Comment_124303" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T10:09:01+00:00" title="February  4, 2008 10:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make up stats for the NPCs as per usual and then anyone who's not directly involved in the conflict currently at hand can play any NPCs who are.<br/><br/>Or declare them irrelevant and don't stat them out.  Whatever they are, they're not what the story is about, so you don't need stats for them.  They'll simply be part of the narrative that the other characters have conflicts over.<br/><br/>So let's assume 4 players and here's the oracle results:<br/>Blood &amp; Sex<br/><br/>9C: A young girl, inexperienced but astute and a canny judge of character.<br/><br/>6H: The alliance by marriage of a certain tyrant's family with the cult of a certain desert god.<br/><br/>QS: A warrior-priestess of a truly bloodthirsty cult.<br/><br/>8H: The local lord's daughter, tramping after strawberries.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/>Young girl<br/>Tyrant<br/>Bride<br/>Groom<br/>Cultists<br/>Desert God<br/>Warrior Priestess<br/>Local lord<br/>Daughter tramping after strawberries<br/><br/>So start combining them a bit<br/>The young girl who is astute and a good judge of character is the one after strawberries and is the sister of the groom<br/>The Local Lord is the tyrant.<br/>The Warrior Priestess of a bloodthirsty cult is the bride to be.<br/><br/>Player 1 takes the Warrior Priestess/bride to be<br/>Player 2 takes the Local Lord/Tyrant<br/>Player 3 takes the Desert God<br/>Player 4 takes the Young girl (sister of the groom)<br/><br/>That leaves the Cultists and the Groom as undefined as a character.  Make up NPC sheets for them and have anyone who's not actively involved in a scene feel free to grab them as needed.  Or don't stat them out and whomever has narrative rights talks about them when answering other characters in conflict.<br/><br/>Some best interests:<br/>Desert God wants his Warrior Priestess to kill the tyrant/local Lord and wants the young girl as a new Initiate/concubine.<br/>Local Lord wants the Desert God's power to come under his sway and wants the priestess to get pregnant (preferably by his son, but he'll step up if need be)<br/>Warrior Priestess is jealous of the relationship between her husband to be and his sister (they're close) and wants her to be gone/dead.  She also wants to restart the war between the Local Lord and the Desert God<br/>Young Girl wants her brother to stay single and have it be like when they were younger and wants her father humiliated for how he abused her and her brother when they were younger<br/><br/>If you really need to represent the cultists, make them the Warrior Priestess' strength (far reaching).  The fact that the groom has no character simply means that no character can accomplish their best interests related to the wedding by going after him.  They would have to go after someone else with the groom simply being an object they are struggling over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124306/#Comment_124306" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T10:14:01+00:00" title="February  4, 2008 10:14AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our play is very adversarial, but I don't recall strong over-arching plot.

Each of us then choses one to two characters to be our PCs. (Mo often takes two, I usually only take one.) The other characters all then go in the NPC pot. Because I'm quicker about such things, I usually stat up the NPCs, but Mo often gives them Particular Strengths. <br/><br/>We then play with each PC (not each player) getting a scene in a round robin. So if Mo has two PCs and I've one, she'll get two scenes to my one. So far this hasn't been a problem. Either of us can frame the scene, but the GM at the moment usually does it. In those scenes the player of the moment plays the PC and no one else, while the GM uses which ever of the NPCs they want to. Which, yes, means we often play the same NPC in different scenes. So far this hasn't been a problem, but as we get closer to the end of a chapter we have noticed we often get a "signature" NPC or two that the other person is reluctant to play. (That NPC often becomes a PC in the next game.) In those cases we just informally do it or don't -- a system which probably wouldn't work for larger or more contentious groups. <br/><br/>And yes, we often have multiple PCs in a scene -- though so far we've only ever had one PC from each player in the scene at once. Two PCs of the same player haven't been in a scene together, but that should change next session. This too has not been a problem so far, we just stick to best interests and let the dice fall. <br/><br/>As for the issue Emily points out -- having someone keep track of the plot -- both Mo and I are good at that, and we both push plot lines in game. How they turn out depends on character action, which depends on dice, and boom... no problems. However, that's because we're not having "no GM" and really are doing "dual and dueling GMs."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124310/#Comment_124310" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T10:21:16+00:00" title="February  4, 2008 10:21AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps we're miscommunicating the subtle distinction between "no one GMs" and, as Brand says, "everyone GMs".

Every move a GM's characters make is against a PC, which is not true for PCs.<br/>3 - Because one person has scene setting power (of course input can be taken from everyone), you can steer the nature of a chapter and bring it to a close when it's time. (Actually I consider that part to be a bit of a weakness of IAWA, how am I, an unfeeling monster, to know when a chapter is over?!

Of these, only one seemed to have any lack of punch (of course, this was the one Vincent was playing in). <br/><br/>When we play, we stat out all the characters as PCs in the beginning, one or 2 per person. Usually, one of these is always the domain of that player to play, and if the other character needs to appear in the same scene as the first, the scene framer just asks someone else to play them for the scene. Or, if all the characters are together in a scene, its as easy to have 2 players representing 2 characters each as it is for one to have 1 character and the other (GM) to have 3. <br/><br/>JDCorley's GM roles are meted out as follows:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>1 - Your characters are never going to be protagonists and they can't go on the owe list, so you're free to make them explode crazily.</blockquote>\nRight, in GMless IaWA anyone can go on the We Owe list. Which is good for me; I like the freedom of letting that emerge in play from whoever happens to be playing a character that turns out to be interesting.  I feel free to make all my characters explode crazily, without regard to whether I'm playing as 'GM' or 'Player'. In one of the games, a bear almost went on the Owe list, except he never had the smaller dice in a conflict. In an anthology machine, protagonism naturally follows the interesting characters. By definition in IaWA, those are the characters willing to go up against bigger dice. Excluding some characters from being in later stories just because of who happened to be playing them has a good chance of depriving me of stories I might like to hear about them later. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The best interests of your characters will always target PCs, and that's only sometimes true for PCs. Every move a GM's characters make is against a PC, which is not true for PCs.</blockquote>\nWhen making characters for GMless play, everyone should have at least one Best Interest that targets another character, and for most characters, both Interests will directly oppose the interest of some other character.  Since there's no such thing as PCs or NPCs, everyone is arrayed in opposition. Everyone's job is to fight for their Interests and interrupt the interests that interfere with them. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Because one person has scene setting power (of course input can be taken from everyone), you can steer the nature of a chapter and bring it to a close when it's time.</blockquote>\nWe rotate scene-framing duties in GMless play. I read the section aloud about how to put conflict in scenes, and tell all the players this is their job when they frame a scene: put one of their characters in it, put another character in it, and head for either a direct conflict, a circled conflict, or drawing out a new conflict. In general, this works just fine. When that scene is over, a player who wasn't in that scene takes over, framing the next scene. Chapters tend to come to a natural close, either through time constraints in the real world or through one or more of the players accomplishing something in line with their Best Interests.  Vincent's checklist is good advice here. <br/><br/>Emily's caution is important - somebody needs to be opposing the other characters - but if everyone's Best Interests are properly pointed, there will always be someone to do that with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124366/#Comment_124366" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T13:54:41+00:00" title="February  4, 2008  1:54PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthew's example is a good one to properly point the interests as Dave is saying:\n<blockquote><b>Player 1</b> takes the Warrior Priestess/bride to be: Warrior Priestess is jealous of the relationship between her husband to be and his sister (they're close) and wants her to be gone/dead. She also wants to restart the war between the Local Lord and the Desert God<br/><b>Player 2</b> takes the Local Lord/Tyrant: Local Lord wants the Desert God's power to come under his sway and wants the priestess to get pregnant (preferably by his son, but he'll step up if need be)<br/><b>Player 3</b> takes the Desert God: Desert God wants his Warrior Priestess to kill the tyrant/local Lord and wants the young girl as a new Initiate/concubine.<br/><b>Player 4</b> takes the Young girl (sister of the groom): Young Girl wants her brother to stay single and have it be like when they were younger and wants her father humiliated for how he abused her and her brother when they were younger<br/><br/>That leaves the Cultists and the Groom as undefined as a character. Make up NPC sheets for them and have anyone who's not actively involved in a scene feel free to grab them as needed. Or don't stat them out and whomever has narrative rights talks about them when answering other characters in conflict. If you really need to represent the cultists, make them the Warrior Priestess' strength (far reaching). The fact that the groom has no character simply means that no character can accomplish their best interests related to the wedding by going after him. They would have to go after someone else with the groom simply being an object they are struggling over.</blockquote>\nSo we've got 4 characters putting pressure on one another. I'll use arrows to represent pressure.<br/><br/>Warrior Priestess<br/>---&gt;Young Girl (wants her out of the way/dead)<br/>---&gt;Local Lord (wants at war with Desert God)<br/>---&gt;Desert God (wants at war with Local Lord)<br/><br/>Local Lord/Tyrant<br/>---&gt;Desert God (under his sway)<br/>---&gt;Warrior Priestess (pregnant by his son)<br/><br/>Desert God<br/>---&gt;Warrior Priestess (to kill Local Lord)<br/>---&gt;Young girl (become his initiate)<br/><br/>Young Girl (groom's sister, Local Lord's daughter)<br/>---&gt;Groom (stay single, keep their relationship the same) (implied pressure on Warrior Priestess and Local Lord)<br/>---&gt;Local Lord (humiliate for childhood abuse)<br/><br/>That's a great story right there. The web is strong, each character has at least 2 arrows pointed at them. (Warrior Priestess 2 1/2, Local Lord 2 1/2, Desert God 2, Young girl 2).  And there are natural alliances, the Young Girl could apply to the Desert God for power as an initiate to take down her father and oppose the Warrior Priestess. The Local Lord and the Warrior Priestess have similar plans for the groom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124368/#Comment_124368" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T14:06:46+00:00" title="February  4, 2008  2:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to answer the original post: Polaris-like cosmos wouldn't work well for IAWA (I think -- experimentation might help) because the cosmos is strongly character-centric and characters in IAWA are disposable commodities.
