I'm looking for a gaming group in London, perhaps doing a few one-offs initially.  I work full time and am doing an MSc part time so I might not be able to commit to anything weekly.  I've got stacks of the rulebooks and would actually like to get around to playing some of them.<br/><br/>I'm keen to try PTA, IAWA, Dogs, Trollbabe, Polaris and Burning Wheel/Mouse Guard amongst others.  I have some experience of Sorcerer and Cold City and would also like to play these.   Actually I'm happy to play anything character-driven.<br/><br/>I live in South London (SE23) but can travel - weekdays, except Tuesdays or weekends possible at present.  Feel free to post or whisper.  Perhaps a social meet might be in order to suss each other out a bit.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Piers                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265739/#Comment_265739" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T06:36:35+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  6:36AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've been known to dabble. Keep an eye on one-off events, either in London or close to it. There was a SteveCon recently (a mini-convention in a pub). Also, I recommend Concrete Cow, which is only an hour's train journey from London. If you fancy a longer trip, IndieCon, on the South Coast, is excellent.<br/><br/>If you organise some one-off events, there are various Londoners who might come along, depending on stuff.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265745/#Comment_265745" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T07:56:04+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  7:56AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, thanks for mentioning <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow</a>.  The next one's on 11 September, in Milton Keynes, if you're interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of people from the Milton Keynes RPG club work in London and play/run various games there.  Whisper me some contact details and I'll pass them on.  I'm afraid I'm not that sure what games they're involved with, so I can't be more specific.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
