I'm thinking of running a game that would start off as one thing, turn into something else, and then hopefully end up as a third thing.  But I don't want the players to feel as if I'm playing a game of bait-and-switch.  Or fall into the traps of a "meta-plot" that makes them feel like their characters are insignificant.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess what I'm asking is what is the best way to change the campaign on players?                </div>

                            Just to clarify, are you doing this with the player's foreknowledge or are you surprising them?                        </div>

                            I'm not sure yet.  That is part of the question.  Is it better for the characters to know or not know?<br>
<br>
The basic idea is a game where the players are playing knights.  It starts off in what I like to think of as "knightpunk" where the characters are knights that go to tournaments and engage in courtly "love".  It uses simplified rules (no damage since all the weapons are supposed to be blunted).  After some foreshadowing, civil war breaks out so all the violence and sex now hurts more.<br>
<br/>
So the setting changes, the rules change, and the situation is altered.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            Ooooooooh, that's not at all what I thought you were talking about.  I thought you were talking about starting off with The Shadow of Yesterday and then switching over and suddenly playing Shadowrun.<br/><br/>I would suggest that you present the tourney as a 'tutorial' phase where the players get into the game -- they learn the basic rules (assuming you're using the same mechanics to hit, just dropping damage, and the like) and they get acclimated to setting and character.  Then you take off and go.<br/><br/>But I think you should make it explicit from the start that the game isn't the tourney, the tourney is the prequel to the "real meat" of the game.  Otherwise you may have players who really dig on the courtly tourney and get disappointed when they're stuck on a battlefield.<br/><br/>(Quibble: it sounds like the setting doesn't really change, the rules get elaborated, and the situation is expanded)                        </div>

                            I'd be entirely up front, myself.  If you think the jarring surprise will delight them, just tell them the game will be changing mid-stream.  I think it would be better to lay out the entire idea, since they can then help you foreshadow and get their characters into interesting, compromising relationships in advance of civil war.                        </div>

                            If the POINT of the first game is to create relationships, and the system rewards and encourages that, then they'll do it.<br/>
<br/>
If the POINT of the second game is for those relationships to come into conflict, father against brother, husband against wife, and the system rewards and encourages that, then they'll do it.<br/>
<br/>
What would the point of the third game be?  To pick up the pieces afterwards?<br/>
<br/>
In the first game, reward people for creating, defining, and enhancing relationships.<br/>
<br/>
In the second game, reward people for "burning" relationships, in whatever way seems best.                        </div>

                            I suddenly love the idea of this game. It's sort of A Game of Thrones meets Pendragon. <br/><br/>Nummy. <br/><br/>But for sure, for certain, and without a doubt, I would want to know about it before hand. I would also want to know the general changes, and how long you'd guess it would be before we would switch from one mode to another (or how we'd mark out the change, or a similar structure). <br/><br/>Without that knowledge I'm going to have a harder time bringing my character and the game into story alignment.                        </div>

                            The third game is more fuzzy in my head.  I want the characters to go on a Quest (with a capital 'q').<br/>
<br/>
In a way the game is about violence and sex.  The first phase they are supposed to be games where nobody gets hurts, then people start getting hurt and it becomes the second game where violence and relationships (a better word than sex) are used as weapons.  But the civil war can't stop itself, too many people are hurt, so a scared Quest must be used to heal the land ... and the characters.<br/>
<br/>
There isn't going to be a set Quest (like find the magical cup), I'd like the players to help come up with one.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know enough to make the Quest what i want it to be yet.  But I do know that the game will change and I don't want the players to feel betrayed.  The characters, sure I want the characters to feel betrayed, but not he players.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I'm going to chime in on telling your players at the outset that the game has three phases, and either have an explicit pacing mechanic or just outline how many sessions each phase will take.<br/>

                            Over lunch, I got the idea that the changes are player driven.  They get to choose with to go from the first to the second phase by when they want to hurt someone.  And they can choose when to go from the second to the third by choosing the Quest.                        </div>
