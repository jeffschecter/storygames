I'm an author of fiction (sci-fi, fantasy, martial arts epics and superhero genres) and I'm interested in creating a system that I can plug-and-play my settings with. It will be marketed to fans of my fiction, not hard-core gamers, so it could serve as a gateway game for new players. Although, that's just an excuse for me to be able to play around in my own worlds, which I love.<br/><br/>The game, thus far, follows the theme of narration. It was inspired by Fate, Technoir, Lady Blackbird and, to a lesser degree, the Storyteller system. The concept is as follows.<br/><br/>The author (Gamemaster) lays out the narration and directs the plot. The story involves nouns (people, places and things), of which protagonists (player characters) are the most important. The author moves these nouns around until conflict erupts. Conflict happens when a noun tries to change the narrative by adding, revising or editing out adjectives on other nouns. Nouns use verbs (skills) to change the narrative by proposing which adjectives they want to add or modify.<br/><br/>The Law of Narrative Truth (LoNT) dictates what happens in the narrative and MUST be obeyed. To add/modify an adjective it must be believable to do so. Once it has happened, the narrative has been changed and the next acting player should consider this before they decide on their next course of action. The LoNT also states rules on the severity of adjectives that are allowed, which must match the length or success factor of the mechanics involved.<br/><br/>All nouns have two descriptors: adjectives (attributes that describe what they are) and adverbs (that describe how the noun can use verbs or how adjectives can be applied). Characters have a third descriptor: verbs, which are the skills. For instance, an elf might have "Agile" as an adjective and a "Low-Light" as an adverb on their (perception) verb, describing special ways they can use that verb - in low-light conditions in this case. Adverbs essentially add to the definition of the verb, which will dictate exact uses of the verb under normal conditions.<br/><br/>Obviously, that stuff is pretty similar to Technoir. Although, I would venture to say that it is the underlying element to just about any other game, Technoir just brings it to the fore instead of covering it up with confusing mechanics. I suspect quite a bit of the above will change with playtesting, but that's where I'm at with it.<br/><br/>Where I'm stuck is with the dice mechanics. I have some really good ideas for using a similar dice mechanic to MHR - that Effect Die has so many possibilities - and since I want to plug-and-play this system with many different settings, it could work. But Cortex+ has a pretty distinct rolling mechanic, and I don't know if I want to go so far as to take it wholesale. As an author, I'm constantly trying to make things unique in my fiction, so taking inspiration from other sources already has me feeling a bit guilty - outright borrowing of a mechanic like that just feels...wrong.<br/><br/>Another option I've been considering is a success mechanic, similar to Lady Blackbird, where the dice are rolled and the successes determine how severe the adjective can be, or how well you go about removing it. But this makes it difficult for the plug-and-play capabilities - I don't want massive amounts of dice being rolled in a supers game, for instance.<br/><br/>So, that's where I'm stuck. Any advice on choosing a mechanic would be awesome. Here are the goals for the mechanic in this game...<br/><br/>Simple - since this is targeted as a gateway game for fans of my fiction and settings, it shouldn't be of the complicated sort that hardcore gamers would enjoy.<br/><br/>Varying Degrees of Success - inflicting adjectives on a target can allow for some very devastating results from a single roll. By making the mechanic have degrees of success, I can determine how severe an adjective can be. This seems to conflict with the first goal a bit, which is why I like the MHR mechanic for its built in level of degree.<br/><br/>Evokes Traits - static modifiers to rolls make it easy to look at the numbers and forget where they come from in the narrative. By consulting the traits and determining which dice to roll from them, it evokes the character's attributes and solidifies their presence in the scene. I guess that's a long way of saying "reduce the meta."<br/><br/>Thanks for any help.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383356/#Comment_383356" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T17:30:54+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  5:30PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [cross posted]<br/><br/>Since you mentioned the Law of Narrative Truth, I strongly suggest checking out Daniel Bayn's Wushu Open.

I looked at Wushu in the past, which is probably where the Narrative Truth idea came from - I knew the words sounded familiar when I came up with them, but Google turned up nothing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/>At the time, Wushu didn't seem like what I wanted, but now, it seems very appropriate. I was just working on something like the Chi mechanic, although not as polished, and this gives it some validity. If I replace the "dice per action" with "dice per relative trait" I could have something closer to what I'm trying to do. Although, I kind of like the idea of not limiting actions...<br/><br/>Thanks very much. I'm going to explore this option.

If you can narrate a trait, you add a d6 to your dice pool. Then the GM narrates and adds 1 die, then you narrate and add 1 die, until you run out of traits, roll the pools and compare them. Alternating the narration of traits (rather than declaring them all in one go) generates fiction beautifully and in dire straits it forces the characters to resolve the situation with some unusual traits.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14752/becoming-heroes-is-available/p1" rel="nofollow">authors' thread</a><br/><a href="http://games.transneptune.net/games/becoming-heroes/" rel="nofollow">the game page</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer" title="worldnamer"><img alt="worldnamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/224926835_32ff7cf58d_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer">worldnamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383366/#Comment_383366" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T18:38:05+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  6:38PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, so lots to say here, but I don't know how to say it coherently.<br/><br/><b>Advice on a mechanic</b><br/>This depends tremendously on the game you're building and the post you've written makes it sound like you're shooting for a "generic" RPG. There are no generic mechanics. The things you want your core mechanic to have are likewise things I would want for any core mechanic. That is, they don't help select from the vast and beautiful world of possible mechanics. Find the thing you're modeling and create a mechanic for that.<br/><br/><b>Advice on terms</b><br/>I pretty much never want to inflict an adjective to anyone. Finding the right terms for what you're talking about will go a long way to find the right mechanical representations for those terms. If you have to explain what a term <i>means</i> (and not simply how it works) then it's probably time to find another name.<br/><br/><b>I'm kind of terrible at these</b><br/>Just because I say these things are true isn't like, some claim to authority on my part. I suck at this. But I've found that getting better at these two points (choosing specific things to model and using the right language to describe those things) has made the stuff I make better. This is all intended in the spirit of "hey, there've been times I've screwed this up and it might be helpful to share that."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383368/#Comment_383368" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T19:27:21+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  7:27PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ivan: That works well with the Wushu mechanics, and still leaves it (somewhat) turn-based, which I like. And, a big plus here, it invokes the abilities of the character. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'm not sure how it would work for the GM when there is no trait - ie. when the attempt is to overcome something in the environment. Maybe they could describe difficulty, complication, etc.<br/><br/>worldnamer: Thanks for the advice. After looking back at my first post, it seems that I've returned back to square one, and after more than a month of work... Your advice is greatly appreciated, as this is my first go around at this.<br/><br/>I get what you're saying about traits, but I don't foresee it as being a big problem (again, my first time - it could turn out to be huge!). I don't think it's anymore complicated than trying to explain what Essence does in Exalted, or Willpower and Disciplines in Vampire. In fact, my noun/adjective/verb/adverb could be easier, since once you learn what it does, it applies to everything, in every setting the game is played with. <br/><br/>Of course, that depends on how generic it can be made. As you've pointed out, building a system towards the specific system has its advantages, as Cortex+ has proven.<br/><br/>Maybe I can strike a balance? Build a core set of rules and then modify them based on setting, perhaps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383369/#Comment_383369" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T20:12:52+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  8:12PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would stat up the environment only if it makes sense to challenge it.

That said, there are a few hold-overs from other systems that I'd like to mix in. For the most part, I'm finding it fairly easy to do so. My biggest problem is in a condition mechanic (the Adjective one from above, although I'm likely going to abandon that whole "Narrative" approach to trait naming).<br/><br/>I like the Chi mechanic, a lot, but I'd also like to explore potentially using a condition mechanic. It's one of the things I wanted to use from the beginning of my design phase and, if possible, I'd like to stick with it.<br/><br/>The idea is that achieving a success over an opponent (which would normally remove 1 or more Chi) the target gets a complication. Complications are rated 1-5, depending on how many successes were achieved - future rolls against the target can increase the Complication ranking or add another one. Complications do affect play, they aren't just narrative.<br/><br/>That would do well in a one-on-one fight, but when you have a nemesis against two or more PCs, you run into the problem of which Complication to apply - and it can get real messy with a whole party against a Huge Bad (X-Men against Magneto, for instance). At the end of the round, when all the players's Yang successes are added up, which Complication gets added (there could be more than one, depending on the descriptors of the actions).<br/><br/>I've already thought of splitting the phases into traditional rounds (one player acts, then turns over initiative to someone else), as that would make it easier to determine which Complication is applying at that moment. I don't like that for a number of reasons, the two most important being that reaction rolls will drastically increase the time we spend in the meta game, and the action is just so cool when done simultaneously. I only ever did it once before, with Marvel's old MURPG (the one with the stones). I loved it, but the mechanic sucked.<br/><br/>I know there is a thing for setbacks in Wushu, but it's not quite what I'm looking for, although it's close. I'd like to remove Chi (or any other meta pacing mechanic) and replace it with a descriptor (or several) that evokes the actual injuries and conditions that are affecting the characters.<br/><br/>Thanks guys. That suggestion alone (Wushu as a system) has already been a huge help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383523/#Comment_383523" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T23:37:19+00:00" title="June 26, 2012 11:37PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, this is an easy fix.<br/><br/>When the players all face a nemesis together, if any of them choose different conditions to impart, the player with the highest number of successes gets to choose the condition that is imparted.<br/><br/>I like that, for its simplicity, but I don't because it means that some players are going to feel that their actions were totally moot, except that they contributed successes to help that condition become more severe.<br/><br/>Hmm...maybe not so easy a fix.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
