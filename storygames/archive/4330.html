I think I finally realized what the crux of the issue or problem or dispute or whatever over social issues actually is, and why it was so hard to come to any satisfactory resolution:<br/><br/>(Here's my hypothesis, anyway)<br/><br/><i>The argument isn't actually about mechanics for social interaction as opposed to freeforming social interaction; the argument is about the intersection of narration and mechanics.</i>  In a lot of Indie games I've played, the narration and the mechanics are very closely tied together, because in order to bring something into the game mechanically, you also have to bring it in through narration of your character's actions\xe2\u20ac\u201dor, significantly, through your in-character speech!<br/><br/>BW and DitV spring to mind immediately, but there are almost certainly other instances of this principle.  SotC certainly seems to be in this category, I just know so little about it...  :-(<br/><br/>Anyway, that <i>general</i> principle, for all mechanics, applied to social mechanics, is what can make the latter work, make their use interesting and engaging.<br/><br/>And this isn't a principle I've seen in trad games.  Yes, in order to use the ability you have to narrate appropriately.  You can't describe holding a knife to someone's throat and roll Diplomacy in D&amp;D;  that action clearly falls under Intimidation.  But interesting narration will get you <i>at best</i> a +2 bonus that's completely up to the whimsy of the GM.<br/><br/>Note, this has nothing to do with stakes setting, or in other words the issue of "my guy would never do that!"  That's handled by things like BW's rule that you can't force someone into a Duel of Wits if you can't agree to stakes.  What I'm trying to get at here is actually much more basic.  It has to do with when you narrate, and in the games we're discussing, you do a lot more narration *before* the roll than in the trad games I've experienced.<br/><br/>Yes?  No?  Death threats?  Poo-flinging?<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97770/#Comment_97770" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T07:33:23+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  7:33AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2007 7:33AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sort of see what you're saying, but I always assume when someone is attempting to use the Intimidate skill that they are doing so to the best of their ability (holding a knife on them, idly twirling a dagger on the tip of a finger, etc.) Player narration in D&amp;D is pretty limited in effect, it activates mechanics but has minimal effects on them. It's DM narration in D&amp;D that is where all the interesting narrational stuff happens.  This is made explicitly clear on the first page of D&amp;D3 (not sure about previous editions). <br/><br/>In other words, it's not "+2 if you hold a knife on them", it's "we assume you're being as intimidating as you reasonably can", the situational modifier is for other things - the target knows something scary about the intimidator, the target has mistaken the intimidator for someone more scary, the target is already inclined to believe the intimidator's threats, etc.<br/><br/>But I see what you are saying.

The mechanics are there to help us determine if my fighter hits the orc and then how much damage he does. Some of the indie games have looked at that paradigm and said, "Well what's really happening is the two players are in conflict over the direction of the story." In one narration, the fighter hits the orc, in another version of the story, the fighter misses the orc. The mechanics are really there to determine which narrative path we choose to follow.<br/><br/>Once you open the lens to view conflicts as being about narratives or narrative directions, you can start to do very interesting things. Frex, in SOTC players are free to make declarations about the scene or about the game world. In DitV, you can play with time and have conflicts play out over days or resolve within nanoseconds. I think you could narrate "a dog's bark startles you" or "a gust of wind knocks your shot wide" as your character's See without breaking the game, so long as it fit the narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97996/#Comment_97996" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T17:11:27+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  5:11PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good insight, noclue, and it's exactly why the conflict-level analysis doesn't ring true for a lot of players. They don't see the mechanic as resolving a conflict between players. Although the player of the dude with the sword may want his guy to hit the orc, he may not (and I submit probably rarely) think the GM wants him to miss.  And he is usually right about that, typically GMs don't have that level of granularity of intent. Often times players don't either - they may separate tactical or second-to-second decisions from their intent fairly explicitly, although they have to make tactical decisions, they're not invested in whether any one choice turns out to work or not.<br/><br/>In other words, if you asked my group "So do you think Steve should hit the orc?" most, including the GM, would shrug. That's why we use the mechanics, not to resolve conflicts between players, but instead to establish narrative at a level of detail where nobody has a particular point of view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/budfannan" title="budfannan"><img alt="budfannan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/budfannan">budfannan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98019/#Comment_98019" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T18:33:48+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  6:33PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD I find your reponse interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that I personally always invested in a roll.

That doesn't mean we cut the fight scenes just because a particular outcome is not of interest to me or perhaps to anyone.<br/><br/>Put in another game context, if we're playing Go Fish and I ask you for sevens and you say "go fish", I am not disappointed, even though I "intended" to get sevens from you. Even though we're competing, we're not in conflict when this happens. We've previously agreed on the rules of the game and you and I both know you didn't have any choice, the rules say if you have no sevens you say "go fish".<br/><br/>Conflict implies you and I want different things to happen, and in my group, people are perfectly happy to, within limits, "let the dice fall where they may" in tactical situations. That doesn't mean they're not interested. It just means there's no conflict. We're all highly interested in seeing whether the orc gets hit. Extremely so, sometimes.

When you say:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Although the player of the dude with the sword may want his guy to hit the orc, he may not (and I submit probably rarely) think the GM wants him to miss.</blockquote>\nI ask, why not? As GM I want to provide fun and challenging adversity, and if the orc gets hit and goes down before he unleashes his own attack, the player won't be very challenged. So hell yeah I want Sword Dude to miss. in the sense that we're <i>competing</i>, not that we're in <i>conflict</i>. It doesn't mean that I am having No Fun when Sword Dude doesn't miss, and Sword Dude's player isn't (one hopes) having No Fun if he does miss. But all misses or no misses wouldn't be fun for anybody. So how do we resolve the player's desire to kick orc ass with my desire to take a piece outta Sword Dude? We engage mechanics to decide between two players' competing desires. Competing, not conflicting. We're all still collaborating toward Fun and Cool Story, but we're doing so in a fashion that arbitrates conflicts and doesn't swing things all one way.<br/><br/>I think you're right that most players don't see such a situation this way. But that doesn't mean it isn't a valuable truth. I think one thing that might block folks from grasping RPG resolution in this fashion is the granularity of an example like this. I mean, yeah, the GM probably isn't sweating each and every individual hit/mis vs every little orc. But he cares in the sense of the big picture, and each orc-hit is a contribution to the direction of that big picture.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98084/#Comment_98084" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T07:20:35+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  7:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the granularity isn't blocking people from understanding, I think it actually does change things. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>There's all kinds of reasons why you might invoke a system other than to resolve conflicts or even competitions between players.

That's why I appropriated JD's phrase, "competing, not conflicting."

I certainly shouldn't get to attached to them, to the point where, say, I pout if they lose or lose too easily--as you say, I should just let it roll off my back and move on to the next challenge, learning from previous experience to make it better than the last.

I was not try to say that every roll should be vitally important to sizing up the scene but that fro me and my group if the roll does feel like it matters to our story then we dont make it.  Everyone  may want to expereince that small battle between man and orc blow by blow, no problem.  Everyone may want to see this little battle settled in one grand roll.  Ok too.  What matters is that rolls happen that someone feels some gut energy for.  Your right we don't care about Bond getting beat up by the stooges and strapped to a nuke but that is because we don't feel our guts tightening at the films tension.  Once the nuke is counting down and the guy with metal teeth is kicking Bond's ass then we feel the tension and we care about the outcome.  We want to know the rolls.  If the moment in the story when Bond fights a guy on the docks and its a struggle involving water, boats, gasoline and a gun then we are interested and want the little tension details.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Joel said "[Edit:] I think this is really just an extention of your "Ignore the rules when they ruin fun."

That's handled by things like BW's rule that you can't force someone into a Duel of Wits if you can't agree to stakes.  What I'm trying to get at here is actually much more basic.  It has to do with when you narrate, and in the games we're discussing, you do a lot more narration *before* the roll than in the trad games I've experienced.<br/><br/>Yes?  No?  Death threats?  Poo-flinging?</blockquote>\nI'm gonna come down on the 'no' side. IME, the difference is precisely the inverse: you do a lot <b>less</b> narration before the roll in the more Narrativist-oriented games. Precisely because of the close tie between mechanics and narration, combined with a frequent emphasis on "cutting to the chase" and emphasizing the 'important' scenes, plus [excellent] ideas like "say yes or roll the dice". These factors combine to deprecate lengthy narratives, because if it doesn't drive to the conflict, or lead to mechanical results, it's devalued.<br/><br/>A specific example: I played an excellent game of Primetime Adventures at Gen Con. Each scene we set the setting, did a bit of RPing in those cases where we didn't know the conflict right away, resolved the conflict, and RPed the results. So, in most cases, ~5min to get from scene opening to resolving the conflict. Similar scenes from my trad gaming could've easily taken an hour of RPing before we'd get around to worrying about whether or not there even was a conflict, much less resolving it. And, in fact, my trad gaming experience is that probably 90% of the time around the table has nothing to do with conflicts or their resolution. So, always driving to conflict, without any mechanical changes, would cut the narration:mechanics ratio by a factor of 10. And i'm not talking about off-topic discussions and other distractions, i mean of the serious, on-topic, focused play.<br/><br/>Which may tie into the "20min of fun in 4hrs" meme. That is, for someone who only sees the heart-wrenching, thought-provoking, tough-choice conflicts and decisions as fun, yeah, most of my gaming would fit that definition. But we were having fun with every bit of it--and maybe more fun with the stuff that didn't tie to conflicts or address themes than the stuff that did. Also, for me, the very act of driving to the conflict actually decreases the fun for me. In general, a given conflict will be more engaging for me if we got there through a couple hours (or months) of meandering, low-intensity, RPing; than if we simply describe the conflict, and set the stage as it comes to a head, and then play out the climax of the conflict. <br/><br/>Which, at least to me, *isn't* a tangent, but directly relevant to your initial question of the interaction of mechanics and narration. The big difference i see with lots of more focused indie games isn't the lack of narrational impact on mechanics (though, you're absolutely right, in a lot of trad games, that is unfortunately true--or at least possible), it's the lack of mechanical <i>necessity</i> for narration. In With Great Power\xe2\u20ac\xa6, i can narrate all i want, but if i don't have the cards or traits to back it up, it's has no impact on the story. So it's kinda pointless. In OtE, the narration is frequently the whole point, with rules just intruding on occasion, and conflicts, at least IME, easily and frequently resolved without ever touching the dice; and narration can even be it's own resource, rather than being tied to or constrained by some other mechanical construct. [i'm thinking specifically of the rules that lack of narration causes your combat rolls to steadily decrease; though narrating bonuses is constrained by your bonus dice, just like escalating in DitV or changing tactics in WGP.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98378/#Comment_98378" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T23:44:19+00:00" title="September 22, 2007 11:44PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: budfannan</cite>JD I find your reponse interesting.<br/><br/>I have to say that I personally always invested in a roll.

I submit that if you can choose an outcome without a roll, you, by definition, have some investment in that action/roll. <br/><br/>But what if you (and by "you" i mean "all the people sitting at the game table") have no investment in that action, but <i>do</i> want the action to occur? It's precisely the lack of investment that leads to the roll--since i have no investment in either outcome, if i were asked to make the decision (rather than leave it to a randomizer), i'd end up, probably literally, flipping a coin (or rolling a d2, if that's handier). Because i have no investment in the outcome. <br/><br/>I think this is an extension of the "only roll when both outcomes are equally interesting" principle that some games explicitly codify, and others use as a guideline. That is, "equally interesting" can also mean "i have zero interest in both". So, yeah, when there's a single preferential outcome, don't roll. And if there were a preferential outcome, i'd agree with you: why are we rolling? But i think JDCorley is saying that, for this one little action, there is no preferential outcome--both results will be equally interesting, or equally droll. And, in the latter case, no one therefore has any investment in the roll. But since they're <i>equally</i> droll, there's still no basis to make a decision, absent the randomizer.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>But the point is I'm<i>fer damn sure</i>intersted in my Orc hitting the fighter.

Its emulating TV after all, not the Prose Edda. You don't get a bunch of people just acting in character for 90 minutes on TV. You get scenes. <br/><br/>I would think if everyone wanted to have months of meandering low intensity RPing around the table, <i>Burning Wheel </i>or <i>Spirit of the Century</i> would handle it just as well as <i>D&amp;D</i> or <i>Shadowrun </i>(Don't recognize OtE, sorry) or whatever. None of them have rules to support it, but none of them seem to have rules to preclude it.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh, and I don't really know where your coming from with the "lack of mechanical necessity" to narrate comment. In <i>DitV</i> your raise and your see are <i>both </i>the dice and the narration. No narration, no action. That's as mechanically necessary as you can get. In <i>Spirit of the Century</i> you invoke an aspect an then you describe how you do whatever you are going to do. In Don't Rest Your Head, you decide how you handle narrative control (centralized or distributed) and then you narrate scenes. <i>Primetime Adventures</i> is massive amounts of narration. The scenes may be focussed but the whole game (at least when I played) was narration after narration after narration. There's no mechanical necessity to RP long conversations, but there's oodles of story narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98386/#Comment_98386" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T00:56:33+00:00" title="September 23, 2007 12:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: woodelf</cite>What do you do if the players are heavily invested in fighting the orcs, but you, as GM, don't care about them, or fighting them? Perhaps you intended them as color, but the players find them an interesting conflict they care about and want to play out? Or by "we" do you mean "the majority" or some other subset of the whole group?</blockquote>\nInteresting question, Nat. I'll confess that in this case "I'd be inclined to skip" doesn't translate to "in practice, I actually skip." Because my group doesn't operate from a paradigm that allows for that. In fact just last night I was having a talk with the group about what's missing for me in our games, and on this particular point the majority of players (while supportive and eager to hear me out) probably thought I was speaking Martian. "What? Skip rolls? Huh? Not play out a combat?" Kinda like if I asked them to walk without feet, or eat without their mouths. After talking it over, I'm pretty sure there's no way I'm getting this kind of play out of the group with a system like D&amp;D. Rulesets that support it better might gain some traction; fortunately I GM OtE myself so I might be able to lead by example a bit.<br/><br/>But anyway, I guess what I'm getting at is, Barring a ruleset that supports "There's a fight, but it's not important, just assume you won" type narration and scene froming (the games that come to mind are PTA, Capes, and Shock:), I'd simply not introduce an element like Orcs unless I AM invested in the PCs fighting them. But the other dimension of the question is that yes, I do mean "we " in the sense of the majority. . .if I'm GMing and the players latch onto something I considered unimportant, then we DO focus on that (which has happened more than once, and usually with the effect of pretty intense and unpredictable fun). If time goes by and I, as the minority voice, am not seeing much of what I'm after, then it's time to address that around the table (like last night). But in the meantime, I'm all for going with what's fun for the group.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98387/#Comment_98387" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T01:03:14+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  1:03AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>I'd simply not introduce an element like Orcs unless I AM invested in the PCs fighting them.</blockquote>\nThat makes good sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98392/#Comment_98392" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T01:47:39+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  1:47AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>They don't see the mechanic as resolving a conflict between players.

We could just talk it over and decide, but usually don't we decide to roll dice (or whatever) to settle who kills who? Does that decision mean I no longer care whether I kill the orc? Unless, you're arguing that the decision to use the mechanic resolved the player conflict, and the mechanic is only solving the character conflict (now my heads breaking).<br/><br/>Also, I've read some of Luke's <i>Burning Wheel</i> discussions where he uses dice to resolve player conflicts. If the players are disagreeing at the table then he goes to the dice to resolve it.

I think what I've been fumbling at is that mechanics <i>do</i> resolve things that the players <i>care</i> about, which is not the same as saying they're <i>fighting </i>over the results. Vincent's quite right--damn him and being, like, genius all the time--once we hit the dice/cards/tiddlywinks we're not in conflict anymore as people. We've agreed, "OK, either A or B or possibly C." And we resolve. "Roll!" "Natural 20! Rock!" But if the whole process is working like it should, we <i>are</i> invested (one or more of us) in the result. Like I said (er, swiped from JD), "Competing, not Conflicting." We're not in conflict as people precicely because we've agreed to compete (through skill or luck or both) over the outcome.<br/><br/>That make sense to people?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS Thanks, John, for sharing the tasty Vincenty goodness.

As a GM, part of my role is to create uncertainty as to whether or not I am emotionally invested in the desire to, for instance, kill another PC. This encourages the player to make a similar investment. The game mechanic takes on the subtext of being an expression of will. The results are about how that will matches up to the narrative environment. <br/><br/>This is not a mode of play everyone can enjoy and doesn't fulfill the more passive approach to game play people often advocate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98520/#Comment_98520" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T04:12:35+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  4:12AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>It's too safe, at least from the standpoint of an immersive, emotionally invested play style.

If the players know that there is no danger to their characters / goals, because in the end heroes don't die and the good guys win, then there is less thrill of potential risk when they walk into confrontation with their enemy. On the other hand if they are left wondering, how dangerous is this guy? How hand can he hurt us? Is the GM setting this up so we might die if we don't pull something out of the Hat? Then they will approach it in a totally different way.<br/><br/>But I still think games often have a lot of low investment areas for the GM (or the players). Tonight, for example, I expect my GURPS players to go out and spend some of their newly gained loot on stuff. That shopping may well (if they are in the mood) involve some colourful shopkeepers, contests over price with merchants, and so forth that will determine how much they spend and what they get. <br/><br/>My players may well be interested in the results of those dice rolls but I (as the GM) certainly am not! In fact we will roll for such things precisely because I don't care. If I cared I'd have lists of prices and goods in advance, and the shopping would be more core to the story, but I'm not. They will still enjoy themselves though, which is important, and we'll all get the thrill of a little gambling and chance.<br/><br/>Other times the situation is reversed, where I care what the monsters do, or how long the journey takes, or whether they can start a fire, but the players really don't. Those are less good, since they tend to reduce enjoyment <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98557/#Comment_98557" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T07:13:46+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  7:13AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>Edit: Oh, and I don't really know where your coming from with the "lack of mechanical necessity" to narrate comment. In<i>DitV</i>your raise and your see are<i>both</i>the dice and the narration. No narration, no action. That's as mechanically necessary as you can get. </blockquote>\nI just went back and looked, and i wrote my sentence kinda backwards. It sorta says exactly the opposite of what i intended, due to really convoluted sentence structure, and me just plain mis-speaking. What i meant to say is that lack of mechanical necessity characterizes a lot of trad RPGs, and the focused story games are different because they have a mechanical necessity for narration. Here, try this:<br/><br/>"The big difference from traditional RPGs that i see with lots of more focused indie games isn't that the former lack narrational impact on mechanics (though, you're absolutely right, in a lot of trad games, that is unfortunately true--or at least possible), it's that trad RPGs lack mechanical necessity for narration."<br/><br/>That is, it seems to me that a lot of the current crop of Narrativist-oriented RPGs devalue-to-the-point-of-eliminating narration that doesn't tie in with the mechanics. You can narrate all you want in DitV, but if it isn't accompanied by a Raise or See, it has no impact--it's not really real, in the gameworld context. Likewise for With Great Power\xe2\u20ac\xa6. Burning Wheel, while in other ways a very traditional RPG structure, espouses similar notions that if it matters, it should go through the game mechanics.<br/><br/>Now, obviously, in any RPG you can skip the rules and just RP out whatever you want--including conflicts of any sort. But i'm looking at how the rules are written, and the apparent intent of how they're supposed to be applied. And while some of this is interpretation, rather than explicit statement, it does seem to come across that way to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98559/#Comment_98559" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T07:21:31+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  7:21AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>This is not a mode of play everyone can enjoy and doesn't fulfill the more passive approach to game play people often advocate.</blockquote>\nPassive?

Just wanting to put your own political spins on the outcome. But it's the same play result in all cases. That is, you have three cases, and we all agree on how they should be handled:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) You have some in-game event where the players are not all that invested in the outcome. You have two choices here, you can either just fiat the result, or you can roll. Since nobody's all that invested, nobody's going to complain about either way. Where the players are not invested, it really doesn't matter what method you use. Yes, you can potentially speed up play by just freeforming it in these cases, but a quick die roll never hurt nobody. In fact, when nobody is invested, often nobody wants to make up the narrative, and it's best to leave it to a die roll. This does run some small risk of promoting certain kinds of incoherence, but really it's not a big thing. I personally do it all the time in play. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) There's the case where the players are invested in the outcome of a social conflict (or whatever form of conflict, really), and they're trying to "just roleplay" to come to a conclusion. Nat is right that often this goes on far longer than when using systems with a Narrativism bent (really more just games about discerning player intent), because often the players have no recourse other than to just continue arguing. Many RPGs don't even have a social conflict system. In those cases, heck yeah, arguments can go on interminably... I've seen it destroy games in cases where the GM didn't step in and decide how to move the story on. On the other hand, usually the players do reach an agreement finally (with or without some metagaming going on to facilitate). Sometimes it comes down to which player is willing to go on longer than the other. <br/>\n<br/>\n3) There's the case where the players are invested in the outcome, can't agree, and the system says that they should go to social conflict at this point, agreeing on the stakes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the interesting thing about these sorts of RPGs. The hope for such mechanics is that, in fact, the player gets to narrate precisely as much as is comfortable and/or interesting. You go to the social mechanics only if/when the players realize that they are at an impasse as players, and want the story to move on, and are both willing to use the social conflict resolution mechanics to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's simply an available tool that's used best when everyone discerns that the "roleplaying" going on, if it were to go further, would be the dread dull/annoying case of players simply trying to outlast each other to get their way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs JD says, often we don't care to narrate out the conversation at all, perhaps because our characters are better than we at it. At that point the player is conceeding that he wants a result, but that he doesn't want to do the narration, and is asking to go to the mechanics simply to get out of having to do some bad first person portrayal. Which seems to me to be a good use of the tool. Yeah, if you want people to do more first-person portrayal, that might be a valve that let's people off the hook. But I don't think that it's laziness, it's honestly the player figuring that they can't do their character justice in this regard. <br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno, is any of this really contentious? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98569/#Comment_98569" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T08:02:23+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  8:02AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>This is not a mode of play everyone can enjoy and doesn't fulfill the more passive approach to game play people often advocate.</blockquote>\nPassive?

They sabotaged his game. The individual in question decided to get a new group of gamers and did just fine with them.<br/><br/>2) One person who complained about playing a shitty SOTC game where people talked big about being invested and weren't. This individual admitted to me that s/he lied about AP reports.<br/><br/>3) One person who admitted to me that s/he basically hated the game s/he was in but felt compelled to defend it.<br/><br/>That's just a sampling of the correspondence I've gotten from people who don't want to publicly rock the boat. So while I'm sure you have it all tied up in your head, I've seen differently. Some of you don't like your groups and don't like your games and in my opinion, you're not doing any better than anybody else. The instrumental approach to narrative is fascinating and worthy to explore aesthetically, but I don't see how it's solved problems. In fact, the way that the indie/S community has constructed its identity as a way to solve mainstream design and play problems seems to have merely stifled public discussion of them.<br/><br/>So I stand by what I say. The instrumental approach *is* passive. You et thrown a bone or beg along approved channels within the system to construct a narrative simulacrum -- it strings words together to sound like a story but there is no real obligation to give it sentimental weight. Real emotions are dangerous, but if you seek that type of play you go in conscious of the risks. There are of course degrees of commitment as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98570/#Comment_98570" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T08:05:09+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  8:05AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>It's funny, because I see you all as rabidly agreeing with each other.

Hopefully you're seeing all of it, and there's no larger phenomenon. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt should suffice to say that this is all just a preference thing. I hope it will suffice. In any case, it's quite tangential, as I hope that I've demonstrated. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, on your last post, I agree completely Malcolm. Basically there's no real social constraints on the characters, so players are free to have them go on and on to ridiculous lengths. Having a tool for the GM around to say, "OK, let's move this on to mechanics" is no different than having a combat system there to resolve who gets hit instead of us arguing about that. Such mechanics simulate the social minutia as much as combat systems simulate minutia of things like the interactions of the motions of combat. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98578/#Comment_98578" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T08:18:23+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  8:18AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 8:19AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Backtracking and then marching off at a tangent, it occurred to me that one of the things my group enjoys most is comedic situations where their characters are highly invested in something <i>unbelievably trivial</i>, indeed, I did a whole game based around this which was one of our favorites of all time: Cyberpunk Clerks, in which the characters were losers working in a giant mallplex arcology and were concerned with grinding their skateboards down the escalator rails while dodging the security robots, what Marcie the Slut said about them behind their backs, and, generally, how to avoid doing anything at all. I later resurrected it to a lesser degree in a Cyberpunk Repo Man game in which a good portion of each session was spent yelling at Lazy Shit Rich (NPC) and trying to frame him for problems in stealing cars.  <br/><br/>By taking the trivial-to-the-players and magnifying it in the eyes of the characters, we achieved comedy nirvana.

People need a way to stick together in the face of folks accusing an entire movement of being a waste of time. Do people really want to reveal their vulnerabilities to hostile outsiders?<br/><br/>At the same time, there is social pressure. People write to me about it not everyday, but often enough for it to matter. Hell, I'm sure you know there's another Vanilla-powered board where self-identified indie types get together to discreetly talk about having pretty much the same problems as everybody else. And of course Jack Spencer Jr. comes to mind. That's okay, but when those people turn around to try and "fix gaming" in any global sense it's . . . wacky.<br/><br/>This is why I think it's time to open up another line of thinking about this, so that at least we have *more* tools, instead of merely arguing for our faves. And I think roleplaying in the context of performance and exploring riskier thins is worth doing. I do have some aesthetic problems with instrumental approaches to story but in the end, this is more about what I value artistically and think should be a part of the "diet" of serious gamers, rather than a One True Way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98631/#Comment_98631" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:23:04+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:23AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was reading about the principles of anonymous posting championed by things like 4chan and 2chan today, and one of the reasons 2chan gives for it is this very thing, that people find it hard to speak their minds when they can be identified and ganged up on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98637/#Comment_98637" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:30:34+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:30AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 10:35AM by Andy.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I was reading about the principles of anonymous posting championed by things like 4chan and 2chan today, and one of the reasons 2chan gives for it is this very thing, that people find it hard to speak their minds when they can be identified and ganged up on.</blockquote>\nHere's what I learned from 4chan, and the original Japanese 2-channeru:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.penny-arcade.com/images/2004/20040319h.jpg"/><br/>(courtesy of Penny Arcade)<br/><br/>Sure, Anonymity loosens people up. But in situations of total anonymity I've rarely seen anything discussed that ever, ever mattered. You might as well be talking into your pants pocket.<br/><br/>I'd rather create "safe environments" for people to feel better about speaking their mind without being ganged up on, than to revel in all the freedoms that free speech at 4chan or 2channeru provides. Look in /b/ if you disagree. The "traditional gaming" forum is about this (holds fingers about 3 millimeters apart) much better.  And the stuff on 2channeru is worse, because they think they have, like, global anonymity because "no one else can read Japanese".<br/><br/>It works for some people. I'm hoping that the folks informing Malcolm or keeping it bundled inside find a place to let it out (I'd be fine with it here, and would shiv any gang-upper's account in the neck... but I can only say that, I can't ask others to believe that).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98645/#Comment_98645" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:43:45+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:43AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can we call this thread now completely and truely derailed by this tangent? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was about narration quality and quantity, and how that affects different sorts of players perceptions of the acceptability of social reward mechanics.

Just wanting to put your own political spins on the outcome. But it's the same play result in all cases. That is, you have three cases, and we all agree on how they should be handled:<br/><br/>1) You have some in-game event where the players are not all that invested in the outcome. You have two choices here, you can either just fiat the result, or you can roll. Since nobody's all that invested, nobody's going to complain about either way.<br/>Mike</blockquote>\nwell, I'll pick a nit with this one I guess (but not out of any motive of fixing gaming or anything so pretentious). You see, back to my orc vs. fighter example, I may not have a preference in the outcome, but that doesn't mean I'm not invested in the conflict. By way of example, lets pick three outcomes:<br/><br/>1. My fighter kills the orc. Cool! Completely awesome, my dude swung his big axe and decapitated that evil orc covering himself in evil orc blood. Fantastic. I like that.<br/><br/>2. The orc kills my fighter.....ouch...but still cool! My badass fighter struggled mightily against the evil orc minions but tragedy ensued and my heroic warrior was slain. Tragic, but tragically awesome.<br/><br/>3. No roll, just figure out who wins by GM Fiat and narrate the result. Either outcome is equally prefered, right? So why roll?<br/><br/>Now 1 &amp; 2 are awesome. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> would just piss me off. My fun just got eviscerated. I can make up stuff by myself, I don't need rulebooks and shiny dice to do that.<br/><br/>Mike: I will add my voice to your shouting.

I'm saying that the evidence that people *send me without being solicited to do so*  indicates that *your community* (which may or may not include you, personally) isn't filled with people who are any happier about how their games are going.

I'm sure you don't want Tarnowski and the RPSite Howler monkeys who believe that *all* new directions in games and thinking about them need to be sabotaged using this to break your momentum. But to have these issues -- these *normal* issues -- and then lecture me about "how you roll" implies you have some sort of solutions in hand when you don't. You just don't.<br/><br/>The thing is -- and I wish you guys would really accept this -- is that you are no *worse off* either.

Your fellow gamers don't want to play what you want to play. Your choices *might* (I don't know your situation) be:<br/><br/>1) Start your own game and clearly communicate what you want.<br/><br/>2) Stretch your own tastes and have fun with the people you know.<br/><br/>Not long ago I was feeling uncomfortable with my D&amp;D game because I like to play it as pure tactical wargaming. I was so committed to that vision of play that I say all kinds of problems with our campaign: railroading, inconsistent rulings and so on. But I really love my friends. I stuck with it, communicated and realized that I needed to test the waters with a new playstyle. It worked for me and in many ways, I learns that the dissatisfaction from delayed ratification made the result taste very sweet indeed. That was me plodding and stumbling my way to option <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that even though I am communicating a genuine experience here, I half suspect you'll fall back on Chris Chinn and Vincent Baker's writins to tell you that I'm tricking myself. \n<blockquote><br/>I'm addressing this paragraph in the hopes that there's a real point buried in here, and possibly a means to get the original discussion back on the rails.

A narrative simulacrum has the signs associated with narrative but not the substance. There is no shared sentimental investment in the outcome that approaches the in-world investment of the protagonists. The dice roll says my character is unhappy but I do not taste any unhappiness. I may be disappointed at the negative game effects but I am neither immersed not sympathetic to the character.<br/><br/>I do hope I'm answering a real question and not a rhetorical Columbo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98853/#Comment_98853" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T01:35:07+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  1:35AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>To me Malcom's last chapter reads thusly:<br/><br/>Narrativist play creates a semblance of story, but it is not a real story because it is not immersive.

Because I have no investment my GM fiat would be suspect, as it would be based, pretty much, on chance, and if I am going to involve chance then dice and rules do it much better than I do in my head.<br/><br/>Continuing my example from before I did indeed run a GURPS session which had shopping (amongst other things) in it, and my players did indeed negotiate with a merchant (over the sale of some ornamental daggers) and I did indeed use the dice (and a merchant contest) to see what sort of price they got. As expected the players cared quite a lot about whether they got a poor, average, or great price for their sale and I cared not at all. I had no investment in that (though the players did). Had I simply picked an outcome on that basis they would have ascribed intention and desire to my choice which would not have been valid.

As expected the players cared quite a lot about whether they got a poor, average, or great price for their sale and I cared not at all. I had no investment in that (though the players did).

Having money makes you feel confident, having money makes you feel secure, having money tells you that you time off from earning money, or that you can go shopping for cool gear.

How much volume or detail is expected/acceptable (variable by type of action) is a function of the individual game and the individual group. That's why you're saying,"Hey, indie games have lots more narration!" and Nat's going "No, indie games have LESS narration!" Different experiences, different paradigms.<br/><br/>In Sorceror, you get bonus dice for cool narration. In Dogs you don't, you just get to use the dice you have. But both require narration. So does D&amp;D. Nobody just rolls a D20 and records a result. At the very <i>least</i> you've got to say "I attack that guy with my sword!" The fact that description doesn't reach Wushu-levels is specific to the game design, and even then can vary a lot with the group. Some people probably DO have grandiose wuxia-style descriptions of their D&amp;D combat, before or after the roll. Same with a bluff or diplomacy check; some groups might play out the whole conversation, and others just summarize and roll. Whatever floats your boat. I don't see this as a distinction along the Trad/Indie axis at ALL.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>And this isn't a principle I've seen in trad games. Yes, in order to use the ability you have to narrate appropriately. You can't describe holding a knife to someone's throat and roll Diplomacy in D&amp;D; that action clearly falls under Intimidation. But interesting narration will get you at best a +2 bonus that's completely up to the whimsy of the GM.</blockquote>\nIn light of what Vincent has to say in John's link, I'd say the true distinction between trad and indie games (inasmuch as there is a line, as opposed to an undulating fuzzy strip) is intentionality regarding player agreement. Like Vincent says, when we commit to a mechanical resolution, we're <i>agreeing</i> as human beings to accept the outcome of that resolution system. this is true for all roleplaying games at all times. What a lot of indie designs do is strive toward making clear the agreement between people before the dice hit the table. Stake-setting and Free and Clear are all about this. And <i>that's</i> what can make something like a social mechanic work, because everyone is agreed to the range of outcomes once the mechanics are invoked. The "But my character would never do that!' is solved by <i>negotiating</i> the outcomes--"OK, well what <i>would</i> your character do? What are you willing to lay on the line here?"<br/><br/>Now, if all this gets negotiated out and someone doesn't like the result and pitches a fit, too bad. They <i>agreed</i> to it. Whether they realize it or not. Whether they honor the agreement or not. Game rules can't make people not be dysfunctional. But they can design frameworks for functional people to use, or crutches for the dysfunctional to lean on and possibly rehabilitate themselves.<br/><br/>There's nothing in trad designs like D&amp;D to <i>prevent</i> players from embracing this functionality and have clear expectations, abide by the resolutions invoked, etc. Tons and tons of groups have perfectly healthy and fun play without expectation clash or infighting over resolution results. But they don't do it with a lot of help from the system, because the system isn't designed to give it to them. And given that dysfunction <i>can occur</i> (and has) in gaming, indie designs are focused on bringing that truth about player agreement front and center.<br/><br/>Does that speak to you, Matt? I know you originally asked folks to check you on your insight, and I'm sorry I didn't do so sooner, but it really took Vincent's thingie to get my head around the issues you and others were raising. Hopefully this thread can still be of some profit to you. So check me on <i>my</i> conclusions, and we'll see if there's something here for us to forge understanding on. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99411/#Comment_99411" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T23:53:16+00:00" title="September 26, 2007 11:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2007 11:55PM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>In Sorceror, you get bonus dice for cool narration.

At the very<i>least</i>you've got to say "I attack that guy with my sword!" The fact that description doesn't reach Wushu-levels is specific to the game design, and even then can vary a lot with the group. Some people probably DO have grandiose wuxia-style descriptions of their D&amp;D combat, before or after the roll. Same with a bluff or diplomacy check; some groups might play out the whole conversation, and others just summarize and roll. Whatever floats your boat. I don't see this as a distinction along the Trad/Indie axis at ALL.</blockquote>\nI see it a bit differently. I think indie game design <i>tends toward</i> giving weight to narrative. I wouldn't say its a universal truth, but I think that on the whole it is a defining characteristic of these disparate games we clumsily lump together as "indie" or "narrativist."<br/><br/>In D&amp;D you could easily play out a combat in which your narration consisted of saying "I'm going to roll <i>to hit.</i> What's his AC?" and then subsequent die rolls you could just call out results because everyone assumes you continue to hit with your sword until you say different. I am not saying most people do that. Its admittedly weak, but the rules don't say not to.<br/><br/>Contrast that to Dogs in the Vineyard where your action is <i>both</i> the die roll and the narration. You aren't playing the game if you're rolling dice and saying "I see your 8 and I raise a 12." You <i><b>have</b></i> to narrate how you take the blow or how you block. Another example, <i>Primetime Adventures</i>. Here you set up situation and then you frame a scene through narration, narrate until you reach a conflict, use mechanics to resolve conflict, and then narrate the results. You strip narration out of that and it isn't just weak, the game completely breaks.

This is a granularity issue, though, not really a narration issue. An attack in d20 takes up six seconds of time. If the combat is a massive one and the interest level is at "how do we come out of this" rather than at each round, a big chunk of narration may not be right for that group any more than someone in PTA leaping right for their Issue every scene is right for every group and show playing that game."Dude, take your time, observe the Rising Action."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99607/#Comment_99607" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T16:45:13+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  4:45PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite> I think "Narration married to mechanincs" is a better description than "more narration than trad games."</blockquote> I got no problem with that.

My post is about the need for Narration in the two games, as opposed to what's right for any particular group or situation. You're right, Large chunks of narration in an hour long, multiple character combat really slows stuff down. But I am imagining two groups, both of whom devalue narration and want to focus on the mechanics and not the talking. <br/><br/>Table 1, get into D&amp;D combat spanning 20-30 minutes with minimal narration, mostly rolls and moving minis on a the hex map and calling "attack of opportunity" or whatever. Note: I want to be sure no one thinks I'm knocking this type of play. Tactical battles with little dudes on hex maps can be buttloads of fun. That's part of my point, this can work fine.<br/><br/>Alright, Table 2: A PTA scene lasting 20-30 minutes with minimal narration, just going straight to mechanics and saying "How many reds did you get?" and "I spend 2 fan mail" or whatever. And you can't do it. It doesn't work. If you don't narrate in a PTA scene, its done in a flash. Pull cards, she wins, I lose. Fanmail (although if you aren't narrating cool stuff, I don't see how you get any).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99619/#Comment_99619" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T18:02:20+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  6:02PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, that's my point. "Narrate this and you get a cookie" is passive and possibly lazy. It merely looks otherwise because people are moving their jaws to get said cookies. The assumption -- the destructive, vision-limiting assumption -- is that cookie handling is the sole axis of reward, whether it's a cookie for picking good feats for a cookie for pulling the narrative levers for a cookie.<br/><br/>I've written about this in the past and called in consumerist gaming, because it follows that model instead of the dramatic troupe or competitive wargaming routes often seen in other contexts. You (for the sensitive, you can assume this is not "you personally") approach the table with the assumption that you will be paid in some symbolic fashion for the quality of your participation. In some ways this comes from the failure of other modes to discover and disseminate good craft. What's missing is a coherent plan to entertain (gamers still do not do much thinking about their role as the audience of each other's efforts) or a plan to explore a theme situated within one's personal interests instead of for the sake of the sockets the game offers. I would really like to see a vision of narrative in games that is expressed with more passion than one associates with getting bonus Air Miles or coupons or somesuch. <br/><br/>Without the expectation of reward, raw commitment isn't safe -- like I said, it's not for everybody. It means you fall on your face when you think you stunt should be cool. It means that your impassioned speech is sometimes no better than saying, "I make a speech." But when we basically trust in this commitment from everyone this tension between our desires and the game exists to provide a dramatic rhythym specific to the form instead of paying the player off to emulate some other form. Naturally, there are degrees to this, where we can mix directed reward with that tension. I prefer this for "genre emulation," because they add a bit of flavour without underminin the unique aspects of RPGs as a form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99632/#Comment_99632" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T19:22:44+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  7:22PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like conservative apologetics to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99633/#Comment_99633" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T19:27:28+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  7:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>What's missing is a coherent plan to entertain</blockquote>\nThat is a fucking great phrase.

I'm saying that this just ain't so. How much detail you pour into a given narration is a function of individual groups and circumstances. I can see doing a detailed, in-character speech OR a short OOC summary in any number of games, depending on a gazillion factors, like importance of the particular speech, the player's confidence at the moment in doing the speech justice, the lateness of the hour, the preference of other players, and so on.

The point being that *sometimes* the games that require narrative to go with their actions devalue narrative that isn't backed up with a mechanic.<br/><br/>So if I make my impassioned speech in GURPS I may or may not get a bonus to my diplomacy roll, but either way it's unlikely that my speech is irrelevant, the content of my speech will certainly affect the direction of the game regardless of the die result. Indeed I may not even need to make a roll if my speech is good enough. In a game where there is more integration of narrative and mechanic, though, my speech means nothing if I deliver it without invoking a mechanic, it's like it didn't happen.<br/><br/>I've been struggling with this in Solipsist. When the GM describes a scene I am happy if the players join in to add their own details (with the GM retaining a Veto on his scene) even without a mechanic to back that up ... but this is hard when the game's sole mechanic is all about winning the right to narrate the scenes and populate them with what you want. Some additions are too small, or too uncontentious to invoke that mechanic, so I need to make sure that its clear that bits of narration that don't use the mechanic matter too, they aren't just idle side-comments at the table that don't count.<br/><br/>Of course I could be missing the point                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99704/#Comment_99704" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T06:55:57+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  6:55AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that Fan Mail, specifically is pretty generic as a reward system... players are as likely to give you a Fan Mail point because you made them laugh as for promoting some specific form of story.

I'm not talking just about narrative pacing. I'm talking about the personal experience of play. I believe that structuring play to provide constant gratification while minimizing emotional distress leads to insincere narratives. It's a straight up value judgment on my part, but it's no different than the other more widely accepted value judgments I read all over the place.<br/><br/>People seem to be so deathly afraid of being unhappy, even for a moment, that moments of genuine pleasure are stale and forced by comparison.<br/><br/>When it comes to harnessing the benefits of the form I'm not saying that a rewards scheme is destructive. I think centering play on it is, though. RPGs allow players to explore the tension between personal and group experience and creates important moments in the story by brining them into alignment -- but without that preparatory tension there's just not much to those moments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99717/#Comment_99717" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T07:39:58+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  7:39AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>In games I've used them, Fan Mail-like mechanics explicitly get used to say things like "Oh yeah, keep going there, I'm interested", rather than "You're talking a lot and I have to reward you for that regardless of my opinions on the stuff you're saying".</blockquote>\nI think it varies...I've seen some people give out fanmail because they thought something was neat but clearly didn't think it fit into the overall scheme of what everyone was trying to create collaboratively (and it didn't). Another time, someone said something as they handed out fanmail that I thought was great, they said, "Yes! You got exactly what I was trying to do." That was a kudos directly for collaboration. <br/><br/>Every once in a while even in collaborative games you get someone marching off at a tangent, a complete tangent to everyone else. I am reminded of the last time I ran PTA at the Ides of Gaming here in Tucson, the show was about a world in which supernatural creatures were normal and lorded it over humans. See if you can figure out which character was the tangent:<br/><br/>The human who mysteriously gains the power to turn supernatural creatures into humans<br/>The ghoul publicist who has pro-human sympathies<br/>The former vampire police captain who was turned human by the first character and now has to try to "pass"<br/>The supermodel shapeshifter billionaire who falls in love with the human but secretly backs anti-human terrorists<br/>The Highlander-type immortal who has commando training and is looking to chop up his enemies for power<br/><br/>Hmmmmmmmm....<br/><br/>Not that there was anything wrong with the Highlander character, but when he made a badass I think he was expecting us to somehow make him prove his badassery, whereas everyone pretty much spotted him being a badass and the challenge was trying to get him into a scene with everyone else.  Often times people would just propose an individual scene with him and I'd run that.<br/><br/>He got some fanmail for a brilliant line/quip that he made, and he looked rather shocked. He was going to gain more narrative power for getting off a great intimidating line to some cowardly NPC rather than cutting off some dude's head and absorbing it or being a trained commando? WTF?<br/><br/>Collaboration has this ugly truth in the back of it: tastes differ and people want different things.<br/><br/>Did I say 'ugly'?

Which is that, since people are different, the reward mechanics in these cases aren't about making everybody play the same way precisely (grossly, yes, but precisely no). They're about indicating what each player likes as a method of communication. Whether that's to say that one is interested in what another is doing or, like my example, to say, "That's funny, keep it up!" <br/>\n<br/>\n(And, yes, you can "just communicate" too... Fan Mail just serves as a reminder to do so and is easily recognized). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn't garuntee that players will all follow the same tune, but it does keep them informed. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why I don't buy Malcolm's argument here. That is, I've never found there to be a lack of tension simply because we're communicating well, and rewarding each other for what we like. Because different players want different things, that's what requires the communication. And those differences are where the tension in question comes from. <br/>\n<br/>\nAcrtually for PTA the problem that I have with it is the pre-planning scenes in terms of what issues will come up. That part always seems to be "playing before you play" and is a creative void that I'd like to be filled during scenes, rather than before the scene starts... <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'll agree that, in fact, there are better and worse ways to do this for a given style. But that's not the same as saying that using such techniques will automatically drain intra-player-theme tensions. I haven't seen that particular phenomenon yet. If that's what happens for you in these cases, I can only wonder why. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99748/#Comment_99748" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T10:09:16+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 10:09AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2007 10:09AM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>He got some fanmail for a brilliant line/quip that he made, and he looked rather shocked.

I think "Narration married to mechanincs" is a better description than "more narration than trad games."<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel</blockquote>\nYep, this is it.  That's what I meant.  Or, to expand it slightly, my original point was something like this:<br/><br/>If you haven't experienced "Narration married to mechanics," then you may have trouble grasping how something like a social combat system could possibly work.<br/><br/>Let me go over, real quickly, what this thread is <i>not</i> supposed to be about (incidentally, why have I stayed away for so long from my own thread?  Because, Frankenstein-style, I'm frightened of the monster I've created!)<br/><br/>1) Reward cycles.  They are absolutely tangential to my original point.  (They're a fascinating topic, but an off-topic.)<br/><br/>2) "The motives one brings to the table."  Nope, sorry.  Not pertinent.  I'm talking about the techniques the system requires, if one is playing it as written.  I'm actually not particularly interested in the players' original motivations (or even CA's, or however you want to talk about it).<br/><br/>3) The fact that system can't solve all your problems for you, or will automatically cause your group to have fun.  Yes, I am aware of both System Matters and Other Things Matter Too, but that's <i>not what this thread is about</i>.<br/><br/>I try not to get Internet Angry, but what happened on this thread frankly pissed me off quite a bit.<br/><br/>BTW, Woodelf I think it was--thanks for pointing out to me with your counterexample the lack of clarity in my original post!  I don't actually disagree with your points at all!  You can have purely non-systemic interaction that goes on for a long time, of course.  I was simply talking about the narrational aspects of *using* the game's conflict resolution mechanic and how they tend to be different in indie games.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grimm" title="Grimm"><img alt="Grimm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grimm">Grimm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100481/#Comment_100481" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T11:59:30+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 11:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys.<br/><br/>I've been hiding away from the forum for a while just due to time.  A lot of good ideas here, but I just can't keep up with all of them.<br/><br/>Now that I've got to talk to a LOT more people, I think I can clearly state some of the following things, and 'hopefully' get this thread back on topic.<br/><br/>Ok.  I think the OP is on the right track, but one (note ONE) of my problems with rules for social interaction is a question of granularity in the results.  A sword makes people bleed in exactly the same way every time.  We can argue some subtleties to it, but cutting someone will never make them get better.<br/><br/>Now, in a social situation, something that hurts in one case, helps in another.  Take the knife example for intimidate.  It's intimidating to someone who is alone in a warehouse, it's not intimidating when they know they have a friend in the shadows with a gun.  For some people being loud and yelling really shakes them up, for others it's just fuel to their inner fire (he he, I got under their skin).  Even something as senstive as race/gender, I'm scared of the opposite race/gender, or they're all worthless scum who can't touch me.  And the degree to which each person feels about it is different.<br/><br/>The variables just aren't quantifiable without falling into stereotypes.  A little give and take by a human being is necesairy IMHO.<br/><br/>And, to clear something up D&amp;D wise.<br/><br/>No, there is no "+2 for using a knife to intimidate" but the GM can make the call, and the player can ask for the call, to either lower the DC or create a modifier for it.  If you don't let player decisions and RP affect the mechanics that are there, that's your choice.  Not a failing/quality of the system.  I personally have stacked lots of modifiers up and down both ways on things based on character action.  Both in the conversation, and things they've done elsewhere in the game world.  By leaving these rules 'open' I would think you have a lot more rope to run with both as a GM and as a PC.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if rules are in place for social interaction, and you apply them here and there, but not every where, then you're creating a different issue, directly system related.<br/><br/>Again, these are just my opinions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100497/#Comment_100497" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T12:31:44+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 12:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for stopping by, Grimm.<br/><br/>First of all, social interaction is not the same as social conflict, or more properly, a conflict where the medium of dispute is words and gestures (but not fists or guns or magic spells or...).<br/><br/>Secondly, I would say that the kind of subtle "give and take" you're describing\xe2\u20ac\u201dwhich is indeed very important!\xe2\u20ac\u201dis handled well <i>when the mechanics are tied to the narration</i> as in games like DitV, BW, etc.  (Beast Hunters is another example I think I forgot to mention earlier.)

If the system allows you to make a roll to intimidate someone and you do so and succeed, the game might allow for the players to describe (after the roll) what exactly was done to scare the person.  The player of the character BEING INTIMIDATED could even have input into this narration.  So maybe the player of the intimidator says, "I get all up in his face and yell and scream and shake him."  And the player of the victim says, "Nah, that wouldn't work on this guy."  Well the question then is, what would?  Let everyone have some input into exactly how and why it plays out the way it does.  Does that make any sense?  If the player of the character being intimidated says that the character is so tough he wouldn't start to get scared until they were cutting off fingers and toes, well then we can say that's how the guy succeeded.  The mechanics of it all stay the same (the intimidation worked) but the victim of the intimidation still gets to set himself up as this hardcore badass who doesn't crack until he's being seriously tortured.<br/><br/>Or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100546/#Comment_100546" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T14:54:36+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  2:54PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2007 2:55PM by John_Harper.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say I don't buy the granularity argument, Chris.

In real life. this activity is <i>extremely</i> complicated, with lots of subtleties that are impossible to account for in a game system. And yet, we did it anyway, and it worked great.

No one stops moving forward.  The situation does change, but people don't loose themselves in the process.  They get to react to the new scene.  Are they going to change or not isn't really up for grabs.  How much and in what ways are the only real questions.<br/><br/>If you've decided you're only following one story, then yes, two people move into supporting roles for the one story.  But if you're doing that, then you're missing out on some of what can make RPG's great.  Multiple stories, growing, coliding, seperating, falling, growing coliding, seperating, falling...<br/><br/>Each of those people are going to have a different reaction to exactly the same scene.  They are going to be more, or less, involved with it.  I trust the player to handle the new situation over a mechanical system.  They will take way more things into account with the new situation than I can.  Will they do it in a way that keeps their character persona one they're interested in following?  Sure.  Is that so bad?  Not usually.<br/><br/>When the player begins to react continually in a way where they're trying to 'win', it's time to decide what the goal of the table is.  Are we competing?  Or are we working as a team?  I don't mean characters, I mean players.  Are we trying to defeat the other players, or are we all working together for the best story possible?<br/><br/>One means staying true to character, even over self preservation, the other means the opposite.<br/><br/>Every one of my table rifts in 20+ years of gaming comes down to that problem.  One person trying to win, while someone else trying to play as a team.  The table has to agree.  We want to win, or we want to work together.  If they do, the social part tends to take care of itself.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not sure where your going with the jetliner example there.  Are you saying that it should have had more roles?  Or that because it only had 1, that the system isn't granular?<br/><br/>My point is that by leaving things as open ended as possible, it gives the players the chance to nudge things in a situation how they think makes sense.<br/><br/>Before we can get on with that, we need to get into what skills are, why they encompas a series of complicated things (or don't) and what all that means.  Frankly, that's a topic in and of itself.<br/><br/>But if you can accept that 'piloting' means 'flying planes', the amount of deviation from ideal flight conditions covered by that description is up to the table.  Does weather count?  Run way conditions?  People shooting at you?  Your health?  Age of Plane?  Pilot familiarity with class and size?<br/><br/>If you choose to consider these things, you as humans, can filter them in.  If you don't, don't.  The books, to my understanding, say as much.  If you choose to just make a flat roll, and that's fun for your table, then good.  Have fun.<br/><br/>Now with your plane example, the modifiers are all set.  If you wanted them spelled out in rules, I'd have no problem with that because a wet runway is always harder than a dry one.<br/><br/>Now, spiders scare me a lot less than my wife.  If you whip out a house spider, she'll roll before you can say "look what I have here."  I, on the other hand, just got really brave, because if that's your opening move, you're obviously new to this.<br/><br/>If you're just looking to get info on what someone's weak spot might be, and you're using D20, I'd probably allow a sense motive roll to give you some insight.  If you're using my 'dream' system, I'd expect you to try things till you figured it out.  Just like anyone else would have to do. <br/><br/>fnord:<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm starting to get a clear picture of that after talking to A LOT of you guys.  I'm still not really on board (obviously <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  ), but it isn't as evil as some things being said suggest.<br/><br/>Deliverator:<br/><br/>I didn't think you were criticising it.  I just hear a lot of people say that the D20 system doesn't really handle x,y, or z.  It does but it doesn't.  You won't find a rule that says "+2 intimidation with knife"  but it is suggested that the players take these things into account.  If you think your GM forgot something, bring it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100887/#Comment_100887" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T14:47:37+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  2:47PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might sound crazy, but maybe you should think about trying one of the games that does these kinds of things.

FTA:<br/><br/>"Matilda (tough pretty manipulative survivor kid) vs. Leon's self-preservation instinct vs. the wheels in Gary Oldman's head. We all agree that any of the three might win, and whichever wins, the story goes forward in that direction. Then we resolve!"<br/><br/>But... no one 'wins'.  That's the whole point.  There is nothing in the scenario for anyone to 'win'.  We make decisions, and other people react.  Mechanics are unnecessary to reach that end.  Telling someone how to react, or even when, seems like the antithesis of Role-Play to me.  If' I'm playing a role, let me play it.  If you want to force my role when you don't like where I'm going with it, why are we pretending I have a choice?<br/><br/>Which, ultimately is the crux of my issue.  I'm not saying it might not make certain situations easier.  Of course it would.  You've just eliminated a level of social interaction for a mechanical one.  If you're looking to do that, why are you into RP in the first place?<br/><br/>... and I'm not saying such games wouldn't be fun.  I just see them as lacking the range a more open ended system would offer.  Additionally, I'm hearing systems that don't have rules being accused of not letting such interaction and RP depth occur.<br/><br/>Now that I have SotC, I can say that I like some thing (charcter creation's involvement of other playes which doesn't get talked about enough) and still dislike other parts (compels).<br/><br/>BW and DitV are next on my must purchase list.  I'm looking forward to seeing what both of them have to offer.<br/><br/>Ok, trying not to be a thorn here, so I'll toddle off for a while again.

If your group prefers stuff like that to be role-played out in dialog anyway, they don't need Aspects relating to that kind of stuff.
