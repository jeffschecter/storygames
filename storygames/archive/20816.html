Is it vague correspondences, or specific tools?</blockquote>\nHighly specific. Ron Edwards's theory of narrativism (influenced by, as we know, Lajos Egri) struck me in the mid-00's as an insightful literary theory, which was further reinforced by the well-known series of Forgite narrativist rpgs coming out at the time. Much play and study of the way these games work, how and why they succeed creatively, and in what ways they bring about stories (and how those stories differ from literary storytelling) has brought me much of my understanding in the matter. This isn't to say that I'm entirely ignorant of traditional literary craft, but it's equally clear that the mark of Forgite drama theory is indelible in my writing outside of gaming as well.<br/><br/>I tried picking a specific example of influence, but it's proving a bit difficult, because I don't really have any idea of how common or obvious the way I perceive creative writing is among any of you, and consequently the odds are good that any single given detail will be incomprehensible without the entire context. Perhaps I'll just provide a list of basic artistic convictions, a dogma of sorts, and let you see for yourself - the implications and interconnections to the way narrativist roleplaying games function should be obvious:<br/><b>*</b> Art is an act of communication. Literature consists of multiple simultaneous levels of transmittance, such as style and content, interpreted together in a momentary act of receipt. As communication, the meaning of art is in reception and inspiration of ideas.<br/><b>*</b> Ideas in narrative arts specifically are embedded in diction, images of language and particularly the plot. It is not uncommon for the mode of communication to be round-about, instinctive and occluded, for human cognition apparently processes information actively, passively and at multiple levels; effective, powerful and inspirational art is therefore often dependent on more than merely clear and rational rhetoric.<br/><b>*</b> Plot carries meaning by being a hypothetical scenario that makes claims about the nature of reality: whatever it is that "happens" in a story is, necessarily, a demand on the audience to accept the credence of the events. To accept a plot's credence is to accept - for the sake of the entertainment if nothing else - the implicit laws of nature exemplified by the plot.<br/><b>*</b> As part of the plot, characters in a story are illustrated by their choices and reactions. Each statement of character is also a claim about the nature of reality - of humanity, specifically - and thus again judged for its credence by the audience. Therefore powerful plotting by necessity requires credible characterization.<br/><b>*</b> Once we understand the nature of character, plot and style in the narrative arts, we can construct powerful stories intentionally, combining the appropriate elements. The characters need to speak credibly and truly of humanity; the plot needs to illustrate reality of existence; the style needs to bring a depth of expression that supports the narrative in non-verbal, implicit ways. Humans care about stories because they discuss issues important to them, so this is what the craft of writing is all about - effective communication and illustration of complex, sometimes pre-verbal ideas, often by the means of metaphor.<br/><br/>So yeah, it's basically the Egri/Edwards theory of drama that I operate from while writing stories: introduce coherent characters, set up a plot situation that illustrates the desired premise, have the characters act upon the situation in whatever manner they may, and write down the resultant events with the appropriate style. I hope that clarified something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457043/#Comment_457043" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-12T04:14:53+00:00" title="October 12, 2016  4:14AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            November is also NaGaDeMon (National Game Development/Designer Month) and SGAM (Solo Gamer Appreciation Month.)

In regards to a permanent writing circle, I see what you mean in regards to writing regularly rather than a whole bunch all at once, once a year. I would like to actually also transition to that.<br/><br/>As for gaming experience strait into a novel, it would indeed take a bit of adapting in most cases. I don't think the finished product would look identical to the game, and probably shouldn't. In this case its simply inspiration. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457055/#Comment_457055" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-12T15:24:48+00:00" title="October 12, 2016  3:24PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Over 3 years of GMing a homebrew campaign, I developed the story of the main badguy, which I later turned into a novel that's got about the same word count as Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>7 years later I tried to take another 3-year campaign I just GMed and write it up as a novel with the help of my players.

Before we knew it, we'd put work into turning it into a full novel. We've already released one sequel and the third book is (hopefully!) coming out this weekend:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.peccable.com/duchess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.peccable.com/duchess</a><br/><br/>What I've found most interesting is how far afield we've been going as the series progresses. The earliest novel was almost directly taken from the game, but as we've developed it, we've introduced new characters, and plotlines and storylines we thought we knew have significantly changed. It's as if the writing process has an element of "play to find out" on its own. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457111/#Comment_457111" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-15T03:13:23+00:00" title="October 15, 2016  3:13AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love it when the characters develop their own personalities, quirks, methods, and motives!  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457116/#Comment_457116" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-15T15:25:14+00:00" title="October 15, 2016  3:25PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Regarding our rpg novella/AP "Derak in the Jeweled Swamps", do by all means take a look, and if any insight occurs about it, do share - I've yet to get my fill of critique on it, despite being happy with the experiment myself.

Also, does the meta-level process of gamifying the writing make for added value from the viewpoint of the reader, or would an equally good (or mediocre, or whatever) story written in a conventional way work just as well? And of course, both I and Petteri are interested in improving as writers, so I'm grateful if anybody who thinks they know what they're talking about sees some consistent flaw or art or craft and wants to point it out. (I'm less interested in feedback that boils down to "I don't like pulp fiction and think that it's dumb to invent new words for your imaginary cultures", as one might imagine - besides, I've heard that one already.)<br/><br/>(My questions are really basic at this point, because as far as I know Paul is the only person who's read that story to the end so far, aside from me and Petteri, which means that I simply have not had much opportunity for critical dialogue yet. Sometimes projects fall flat in terms of achieving even basic critical interest from your circles, and this seems to be one of those cases for some reason. Probably it's just that the text's too rough, so everybody gets tired with reading it after the first couple of posts.)<br/><br/>Regarding S/lay, there are big, fat creative payoffs that are only available with multi-episode play. For example, thematic contrast between multiple player characters (same genre and world and creators - presumably similar style - yet different characters may contain different wisdom for us as audience), as well as concrete crosses (as in, different characters encountering same or similar setting elements, such as NPCs, from each other's stories) are both interesting to me, yet only possible with further play. A single character's story also includes extremely significant maturing with multiple episodes: the character's life goals are only understandable after one or two development sessions, and the actual end of a campaign is, generally speaking, only possible to reach in a later session - most characters are not ready to settle down in their first story. The character's story will also necessarily include contrasting thematic elements when viewed as a sequence, as a cavalcade of Lovers and Monsters is viewed, with differing reactions from the hero illustrating his basic nature.<br/><br/>In a nutshell I might say that while there is nothing new mechanically in multiple sessions of S/lay, it's by nature an extremely literary game, and all that literary meaning that accumulates through multiple episodes makes the simple mechanics come to life in a way impossible with just one episode. It's like a comic strip that only achieves its natural heights once the readers are familiar with the (sometimes surprisingly convoluted) character backgrounds and plot conceits underlying the simple 3-4 panel gags that each strip consists of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457118/#Comment_457118" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-15T16:05:15+00:00" title="October 15, 2016  4:05PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            k_man321,<br/><br/>You might enjoy this earlier thread:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19188/games-as-creative-writing-exercises-apart-from-fiasco" rel="nofollow">Games as Creative Writing Exercises</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457119/#Comment_457119" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-15T16:10:37+00:00" title="October 15, 2016  4:10PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I see! Your thoughts on multi-story play of S/law w/Me is what I would have concluded myself from my reading of "Derak": it's an interest in exploring the subject matter in more depth, but not an inherent feature of the game. (Seems to me you'd get just as much out of playing the next bit of his story with <i>Sorcerer</i> or <i>Solar System</i>, for instance.) <br/><br/>Makes sense! It would certainly be interesting for me, as a reader, to read a "sequel" form. (I should add that I have a bit of a predisposition against sequels in general, as they tend to weaken, rather then strengthen, the material in the original work. However, I like the idea that a roleplaying game, by its nature, might be LESS susceptible to sequel-troubles than straight-up literature - or film, or whatever.

Your thoughts on multi-story play of S/law w/Me is what I would have concluded myself from my reading of "Derak": it's an interest in exploring the subject matter in more depth, but not an inherent feature of the game. (Seems to me you'd get just as much out of playing the next bit of his story with <i>Sorcerer</i> or <i>Solar System</i>, for instance.) </blockquote>\nI disagree to a degree - a game design often does more things than providing mere rules mechanics, and in this case S/lay has a lot going on under the surface. Of course, if one were to play e.g. Solar System <i>while ignoring that game's structural features</i> such that the outcome would be a hybrid of S/lay and SS, we might get something approaching the idea. It's a non-trivial transformation, however, so I don't think that we can just say that any old game would achieve this same sort of emergent story depth.<br/><br/>Basically, what S/lay does for us is that it gives a very strict framework of what you are supposed to be discussing next, creatively speaking. This is performative work from a game system, one cannot ignore it - or adopt it to a different game and pretend that it doesn't exist. Solar System does not by nature produce such a strictly focused, cyclical story framework that enables the literary contrasts I discussed earlier; its structure encourages meandering, rather, and its endgame mechanic is so vague in comparison that it might as well not be there insofar as informing play is concerned.\n<blockquote>Makes sense! It would certainly be interesting for me, as a reader, to read a "sequel" form. (I should add that I have a bit of a predisposition against sequels in general, as they tend to weaken, rather then strengthen, the material in the original work. However, I like the idea that a roleplaying game, by its nature, might be LESS susceptible to sequel-troubles than straight-up literature - or film, or whatever. That's an interesting angle to consider: since most games of the sort we're talking about here are pretty heavy-handed about producing all the material for strong Character and Plot and so forth, perhaps sequels produced through gaming are less likely to fall into the traditional traps a writer faces when creating a sequel?)</blockquote>\nThat's an interesting thought, might be something to it. Traditionally sequels are weak because they lack the original's literary motivations, while adding a drive for morbid nostalgia, a wish to repeat tropes for the sake of familiarity. I could see how many games rein in these types of creative weaknesses by, well, simply being games that constrain and enforce robust structure and artistic decision-making. It's simply more difficult to go under the bar when the entire game is designed to encourage you to go over it.\n<blockquote>I'd love to chat about "Derak". Where should we do so?</blockquote>\nHere or at the blog, I suppose.

For the first time, one of my gaming group is running a campaign during November so I wont's have to add that into the month's writing frenzy.<br/><br/>I only realised in the last decade that GMing was often my outlet for having an audience while I'm unpublished. Early games I ran were a little railroady because of that, then overly sandboxy as a reaction, ending up with story games as we're all collaborating in a narrative. Also as a weird thing to realise later in life, I now know not everyone reads the skeleton of narrative, so I sometimes provide a good prod in the story's direction or try to learn to shut up where that's not necessary.<br/><br/>As far as NaNoWriMo and games, there's been a little crossover. I co-run the Brighton &amp; Hove community for NaNoWriMo and tend to bring games like Resistance, Codenames and Spyfall to our social events. I used the Fiasco playbooks to harvest relationships for supporting characters in some stories last year. I've also written up a WoD campaign in a homebrewed setting which was supposed to be a one off. It became a three-season storyline in the end and a good enough story I'd been looking to turn it into prose or a comic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457195/#Comment_457195" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T16:57:01+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  4:57PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X">@Charlie_X</a> <br/>I think thats some great cross-pollination.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457484/#Comment_457484" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-25T13:14:40+00:00" title="October 25, 2016  1:14PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're doing something a bit different here, turning rpg's into plays (as in theatre).

I have been way less motivated to GM proper plots ever since I fully wrapped my head around how railroading can suck.  I miss it.  If I had my druthers, I'd always be running two games, one where I set up a fun environment and let the players surprise me, and follow their lead, and the other where I work on my novel for an audience to flesh out with character reactions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457502/#Comment_457502" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-25T19:32:16+00:00" title="October 25, 2016  7:32PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457503/#Comment_457503" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-25T20:05:44+00:00" title="October 25, 2016  8:05PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2016 8:09PM by Kenny_J.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually find GMing a stress filled experience, I feel as if my half formed ideas are under scrutiny, and at every moment I have to mold the experience to make as many of the players have fun as I can.

When I run that game, I occasionally make a list of "key scenes" in public, with associated rewards.

This question is related to, but not necessarily synonymous with, author stance.  It's also a necessary aspect of Genre Simulation.<br/><br/><i>DayTrippers</i>, for example, is a Genre Sim emulating science fiction short stories or episodic TV shows.  When played with a strong GM, a DT session has a vertical arc which is controlled by the GM while the players control lateral movement in the gamespace, and the turning points in this arc are guided by the clock on the wall.  Scene Framing is the GM's first job whenever there's been a break or change of location, although during the course of play the GM mostly uses Meg Baker's "backwards walking" method.<br/><br/>When DT is played in collaborative mode ("GM lite") the same arc is used, but adhering to it is a group issue, a shared task.  All Players are aware of it, and allow it to affect their actions.  Likewise, Scene Framing is done as a group.  Because - again - in DT we're not really simulating a "realistic" person's life; we are simulating a weird short story.<br/><br/><i>ScenePlay</i> goes even further (structurally speaking) by specifying not only the arc itself, but the individual beats which must be successfully hit before the story can move into the next act.<br/><br/>In the first example, immersion in actor stance remains pretty consistent because the Players don't need to worry about shaping the arc; the GM handles it.  In the second, there is a bit less actor stance and more author stance, as all participants at the table are aware of the the arc, and try to adhere to it.  Finally, a game of ScenePlay is almost all author stance; there's very little "roleplaying" in it at all.<br/><br/>From this we might draw a hypothesis that there's an inverse relation between the depth of immersion attainable in actor stance, versus the Players' direct involvement with the narrative structure as a guiding force or template (and this may be particularly strong in Genre Sims).  This rings true to me: after all, we tend to see the narratives of our own lives only in hindsight.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457518/#Comment_457518" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-26T18:45:31+00:00" title="October 26, 2016  6:45PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>the GM mostly uses Meg Baker's "backwards walking" method.<br/></blockquote>\nWhat's that, Tod?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457527/#Comment_457527" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-26T21:02:34+00:00" title="October 26, 2016  9:02PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2016 9:02PM by AsIf.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I say a "360-degree mirror", but the effect is the same:<br/><br/>"Good GMship is underlying the storytelling work to create evocative, fully sensual environments, but letting the players drive.

Can you illustrate this approach with an example?</blockquote>\nIt comes down to two things: action and emotion.  This is one of those things that's so basic (to my GMing style, anyway) that I had to think about it pretty hard when writing that section of the DT GMG.  And just to be clear: I say "360-degree mirror" in order to indicate that I'm doing more than simply looking backwards; I'm actually looking all around, like a camera doing a 360-degree revolution around an actor who is simultaneously walking forward.  (My style is pretty cinematic, and so - I gather - is Meg's and Vincent's).  I take an auteur approach, sure, but that doesn't mean everything is decided by me.  I take my most thematic cues - both action and emotion - from the Players.  As a general rule: actions get resisted, while emotional tone gets reflected (and modulated, usually upward).<br/><br/>Action cues are easy: the Players say what they're trying to do, and I say what gets in the way.  (Depending on the game, of course, sometimes Players have a larger amount of creative agency, sometimes smaller; but basically: it is <i>their</i> story I am paying attention to, not my own.)  This is all pretty standard GM business.<br/><br/>It's the emotional cues that get truly reflective.  Often these cues are not things the Players are explicitly or consciously communicating to me, but rather elicited, provoked by happenstance, or just blurted out.  I call this stuff "Psychic Content" and it's actually the main thing I'm on the lookout for while running most games. <br/><br/>In fact I often feel more like a cinematographer than a director, using my camera to depict all setting and action (including interactions with NPCs) which is visible/audible as the Player moves from point A to point B, in a way that supports or enhances whatever tone is emerging.  Part of the GM's job is empirical description, sure.  And a basic description will simply list all furniture, walls, exits, etc, but an auteur can go so much further than that.  This is where reflection comes in.<br/><br/>Because not only was it the Player (not me) who decided to move from point A to point B in the first place, it is also the Player who sets or influences the tone I'll be reflecting back at them.  If they're angry and thirsty for revenge, for instance, my depiction will reflect a sense of irritation and discomfort.  If they're weary and the session is drawing to a satisfactory close, my depiction will reflect things calming, relaxing, and settling down.  If they're wary and entering an unknown situation, my depiction will include a few jarring or confusing details to prompt later examination.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457588/#Comment_457588" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-28T00:37:33+00:00" title="October 28, 2016 12:37AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's a fantastic example of taking the general GM principle of "pay attention to what excites the players" and making it real and meaningful.  It's not just about the <i>what</i> -- this location, this prize, this enemy -- but also the <i>how</i>.  A sword swung in desperation to save the innocent deserves a different narrative response than a sword swung in contemptuous revenge.<br/><br/>In my GMing, I tend to kinda get on the PCs' team.  If they're fired up, I get fired up.  if they're cautious, I get cautious.  If they're somber, I get somber.  If they're curious and wondering what's next, then I set the tone and they pick up on it.  This is a big part of immersion for me, and why I can still (in the right context) immerse when I'm GMing (even though immersion talk is usually about players), and also why I hate mood-abandoning stuff like phone-checking etc.<br/><br/>Personally, I dig my "goggles" metaphor more than this "mirror" one.  :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457590/#Comment_457590" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-28T00:54:04+00:00" title="October 28, 2016 12:54AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

between writing and role-playing. Somewhere along the line, a line that stretched to the 1980\u2019s, the two got strangely confused. I use the process of dice, dice-writing, to recreate, well, mimic, the act of throwing dice and seeing what the hell happens.<br/><br/>I have spent some time trying to find a game that recreates a company of (fantasy) characters as they progress through a dungeon. The major problem is the wish for writing gets in the way of rolling, or the rolling gets in the way of the writing. There is little or no breaks that allow you to write, or figure out where to roll, or oddly what to write. I want to play or I want to roll and the things get confused in the mix.<br/><br/>Writer as role-player is nothing easy. A psychotic break between the game master and player must occur for the rolling dice to turn into ink.

If you look at that blessed round table, there is simply too many factors, too much stimuli happening. Besides perhaps all the entertainment of a tabletop is in the participation, without that a serious amount of the effort just dies. Can you watch a tabletop and not participate? <br/><br/>No for writing, for a story, it has be a bit more linear or at the very least with side items or narratives going on. A good dollop of schizophrenia would be ideal in this scenario. <br/><br/>I am just crazy, so I am writing in a quota, solo gaming, and hammering out some odd solo engine that will not get in the way of the writing. But I am even recording the GM rolls or action in brackets. Besides, it is writing <i>fuel</i> not <i>writing</i>.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, it is a mess, but would I publish it in that forum?, adhering to that, not at all.

So for that reason the dialogue is about 90-95% verbatim from the session. I compressed in some places, omitted in others, and occasionally invented dialogue to cover things that we handled in narration or via out-of-character discussion, or to compress a scene.<br/><br/>The writeups however are neither summary nor transcripts; I wrote them formally, using third person omniscient for the most part. In play I don't tend to give a ton of details about scene trappings--certainly not as much as some more evocative GMs I've played with. (I differentiate my worlds via a large amount of distinctive NPCs, which are my primary vehicle of information transmission to the players; it's also why they tend to speak in speeches in the writeups.) When I went through the process of doing the writeups, however, I incorporated a lot more descriptive writing. I had to work through capturing action sequences that were easier to handle in the game but make no sense on the page...well, screen. (A couple of times in Eternal Lies I ended up creating handles for NPCs I never bothered to name or differentiate in play.)<br/><br/>When I did the Eternal Lies AP, I very consciously adopted a more novelistic voice, especially in the early episodes where I was consciously echoing Hammet and Chandler (and in the latter case, inserted some passages verbatim from Chandler when I was bringing his characters into the game.) I even introduced a narrator...a very unreliable one. However, he tended to function a bit like the narrator in <i>Brothers Karamazov</i>--breaking into the text with observations from time to time, even while the narrative remained in a more neutral, observant voice.<br/><br/>So there you have it...a longish body of fiction produced as the result of gaming. Is it a novel? Almost assuredly not. For one thing, I tend to model my campaigns on television writing rather than novels. For another, they're much too loosely plotted and shaggy to be real novels.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, both in the campaigns and in my writeups, a lot of novelistic techniques are deployed: foreshadowing, reincorporation, symbolism, even allegorical action. I'm really not exactly sure <i>what</i> they are, other than very long Actual Play reports. They somehow seem more than just a summary. They're for sure not a description of what was happening moment to moment in the game; as I said, I edited them while writing them. <br/><br/>But they do seem at least somewhat germane to this discussion; so I thought I'd discuss them at least a little bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457858/#Comment_457858" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-05T02:11:44+00:00" title="November  5, 2016  2:11AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2016 2:12AM by Paul_T.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic, Aviatrix.

(Each time I start one I promise this is the time I'll do more summary narration rather than using all the dialogue and every time I hear too many things that are too cool to not use.)<br/><br/>The biggest additions come in the descriptions, which as I mention I don't spend a lot of time on in play but expand out when doing the writeups, since people weren't in the room with me to pick up on my verbal shorthand or other cuing. Here's a couple of examples, from the first episode of the Eternal Lies AP, which may have the most application to this thread--when I did the first couple of episodes of that AP, I actually did multiple edits on the writeups to sharpen the descriptions and basically pack as much Chandlerania as possible into them. As the campaign progressed and I fell further and further behind in the writeups I tended to only do one draft and not work on description as much (with some exceptions, like the first Malta episode.)<br/><br/>This is a transcript of the actual dialog:\n<blockquote><br/>Me: As if on cue, there's a buzz. <i>[as secretary]</i> "Mr. Wright?"<br/><br/>JP: Yes?<br/><br/>Me: Miss <i>[I correct myself to 1930s style]</i> <i>Mrs.</i> Rogers is here to see you.<br/><br/>JP: Send her in.<br/><br/><i>[Quick aside about an anachronistic postcard]</i><br/><br/>Me: So Janet comes in. <i>[as Janet Rogers]</i> "Well, Jimmy, I hear you won another award. So tell me, Jimmy, are you still a private investigator or are these awards just for show?"<br/><br/>JP: Half of the time I feel these awards are just for show. But I still like to keep my feet wet.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nHere's what the AP has:\n<blockquote><b>from Episode 1: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>He had hardly replaced the phone in its cradle when his intercom buzzed. "Mr. Wright? Mrs. Rogers to see you."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy stood up as Janet Rogers came through the doors of his office. She was dark-haired, with the kind of plain good looks that added up to a lot more than the sum of their parts. Maybe it was her eyes, almost black in the dim light, with a smolder in them. They were constantly glancing around, taking everything in with swift, light glances. Jimmy knew however that when the fixed on something her glare was hot, inquisitive, and as direct as any man\u2019s.  <br/><br/>He took her wrap and offered her a chair, but she remained standing, almost in a reverie. She picked up the glass trophy and fingered it with one gloved hand. <br/><br/>"Drink?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Mm-hmm." She put down the award and looked up at him. "Well, Jimmy, are you still a private investigator, or are all these awards just for show?"<br/><br/>"About half are just for show. I still get my feet wet once in a while."<br/></blockquote>\nI will confess that I tended to punch up Jimmy's dialog to a more noirish hero level in the writeups; couldn't help myself, I love the character. JPs actual tone tended to be a lot more exasperated and comic--more in keeping with the original conception of the character as a somewhat bumbling nice guy who just wanted to do the right thing. OTOH, I talked it over with the group and pointed out that JP was kind of giving us Jimmy's internal view of himself--given the large amount of badass things the character actually did, my representation was a bit closer to how <i>other people</i> saw him.<br/><br/><i>(cont'd below)</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457939/#Comment_457939" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-07T18:15:25+00:00" title="November  7, 2016  6:15PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Here's one more, from the same episode. First the transcript:\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Me: Unless anyone wants to do anything, we can cut to the Christmas party <i>[murmurs of assent]</i> So it's a couple of days later. It's not really a Christmas party, because it's held every year on January 14th. Senator Grey has never explained why he has that holiday party on January 14th, except to say that gets it out of the way of all the other holiday parties....so in case you don't know, Bradley Grey is the junior Senator from California. He is a Republican, but he is a non-isolationist Republican <i>[inaudible]</i>...at one time he was the District Attorney of New York City, and moved out here with his fabulously wealthy wife, Erica Carlyle Grey. And every year he has this party--they sponsor several girls' schools back East, and every year they bring the girls who don't have anywhere to go for the holidays out to California for the break. And he has the usual collection of hangers-on, lobbyists, rich people, cops--but also some weird people like Vanessa Brady, an eccentric from Venice Beach who seems to be vaguely related to his wife, famous private eyes...and rich dilettantes. Also, people who are on the government's dime--<br/><br/>OP: Yup, yup...<br/><br/>Me: --and also students, such as Millicent Lowell. <i>[momentary discussion that MP's book was made wet by my automatic air freshener</i> So it's a holiday party. Everybody's milling around. They left the Christmas tree up--<br/><br/>GP: Well, it's a holiday party, so there must be a Christmas tree...<br/><br/>Me: --there's dancing, there's plenty of rich people mingling, and you guys all see each other, probably for the first time since the, the <i>incident</i>. And Janet's there, in an elegant evening gown, as your <i>[indicating JP]</i> guest...<br/><br/></blockquote>\nAnd here's the AP:\n<blockquote><b>from Episode 1: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>The Grey mansion was down in Orange County, surrounded by farms that were in the process of being turned into subdivisions. It sat in between a couple of low hills, with a genuine orange grove in the back, along with a nine-hole golf course, a track and stables for the Arabians Mrs. Grey bred, and a swimming pool the 7th Fleet could have done maneuvers in. <br/><br/>The house itself was brand new, although an enormous amount of money had been spent to make it look like a three or four century old manor house--the kind my Duke of Dundersly might have considered an adequate little <i>pied \xe1 terre</i> for entertaining during the summer. The Senator\u2019s wife had wanted something to remind her of her girlhood summers in England, before her feckless brother got himself killed and she\u2019d had to take charge of her parents\u2019 industrial conglomerate.<br/><br/>The Greys called it a holiday party, but nobody could quite figure out what holiday happened on January 14. The hosts always laughed it off  as a way to make sure nobody could snub them with the excuse that they had another party to attend.<br/><br/>As she did with most pursuits dear to her heart, Mrs. Erica Carlyle Grey spared no expense on preparations. An enormous Christmas tree, dragged with great difficulty from the far side of the Sierra Nevada, dominated the three-story high entrance hall, its top almost brushing the ceiling. Elegantly dressed servants buzzed around the guests, offering dainties prepared by chefs straight from the Cordon Bleu. The champagne was cold, the whiskey old enough to get drafted, and both were flowing like water. The one odd note was the large amount of teenaged girls, wearing the uniforms of various toney East Coast schools, milling around in giggling clumps. Veterans of the Greys\u2019 parties told newcomers, sometimes in a conspiratorial whisper, that the Greys were great patrons of the education of women, and that every year they brought <i>hundreds</i> of girls out to California every year over the holidays--the ones whose parents were overseas, or even <i>orphans</i>, the poor dears.<br/><br/>To this party were invited, of course, rich dilettantes and their bodyguards, famous private eyes and their investigative reporter escorts, and scientists on the Department of War\u2019s dole. That is to say, Ruby, Geronimo, Jimmy, Janet, and Julius. And, of course, Millicent, who was with her classmates.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nDraw your own conclusions, I guess, especially about the quality of my rewriting; it is what it is. I'm not proud. :-)<br/><br/>The main point to take away, I guess, is that I'm pretty conscious of the need to change the way the events are presented. An outside reader, who wasn't there, needs the extra support that doing things in a traditionally narrative way allows. I make even more micro edits--like breaking dialog up with attribution tags to create dramatic expectation, sometimes attributing minor details the players didn't bring up but serve as characterization (lighting a cigarette, brushing hair, glowering, etc.) because I need it for the narrative to function.<br/><br/>There are other solutions, of course. The (unfinished) AP I did of my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19800/midnight-s-voice-a-whitechapel-drama-cortex" rel="nofollow">Cortex + Drama Whitechapel game</a> used screenwriting as the format (you can't see it here, since I rendered it in "book play" format; the original AP I gave the players was in screenplay form). In some ways, this is closer to how I actually run a game--the slug lines for the scenes are fairly close, as you might gather from the above, to how I actually set the scenes in my games, and the rest is dialog, which is by far my most common mode of expression in the games I run.<br/><br/>I hope at least some of this is useful and or interesting...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457948/#Comment_457948" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-07T19:09:27+00:00" title="November  7, 2016  7:09PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            November is NaNoWriMo, NaGaDeMon, and SGAM.
