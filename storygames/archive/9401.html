The world is like that too.  You'd play an army unit, and you'd have to choose who's the sergeant, who's the corporal, and who are the grunts.<br/>2 A site-based game; you guys are part of the 'gold rush' around this massive, ancient dungeon; most people don't come back, but you're the exact kind of psychos that actually manage to bring back the occasional sack of golden junk.  Or not; then you roll new characters.<br/>3 A high-powered game; we start at level 10, come up with some hooks for how you're already in the thick of various arcane and mundane conflicts, and from there we just keep pulling out crazy stuff, rolling it back to your backstories, until level 30.<br/><br/>What do you guys think?"</i><br/><br/>Then it depends on what they say they want.  But the very next thing - around when people are figuring out who's covering what roles, but before characters get made - is to have them make something.  <br/><br/>Like this:<br/>1 <i>"So I can set up, I need an idea of a battle where one of the higher-up officers noticed you - that's why they've been added to the 'elite unit'.  Think of the terrain, too, and we'll add the battle sites to the map.  Also, something you guys lost to the war, so I can add that to the map too."</i><br/>2 <i>"This will take a second; instead of a big backstory, which we can work out in the game, can you think of your character's top 3 sins?  Then we'll talk around the table a bit; everybody try to think of stuff that would tempt that sin.  So you have a list of sins ranked by importance in the game.  Then you get each player to write 1 thing that could tempt a sin, for at least 3 different sins.  And they talk about their characters ideas.  I might say "OK, what are you greedy for?" and Joe says "Gold's OK, but especially having people in my back pocket." then Tim, who's not even the GM, thinks "oh, I've got an idea - the mayor is massively in debt to the casino; right now another guy is covering his debts, but that guys is actually a vampire from the dungeon", so Tim says "I've got Greed!" and writes it down for the GM to use later.  Now, I can change details, but not throw it out, and people shouldn't give each other's ideas away, but they can salivate waiting for sin-gratification because they helped generate it.</i><br/>3 <i>"Make up a small faction that you're in charge of (like a small thieves guild), or a large one that you're a rising star in (like being a small city's lord-wizard in a magiocracy)."</i><br/><br/>Once you've had that conversation, get them to create characters.  Then write up a 1 page summary of the game and the ideas you all talked about, and at most 1 page of other info for the starting PCs (short is crucial, players will want to get right to the game). <br/><br/>Then get your session ready like the DMG suggests, using or referencing as much player-contributed material as possible (including their characters).  Just like the game says, you don't need to have much more than a sketchy map to start; let things evolve from what the players show interest in.  Like, if you're two sessions in and have them come across a cyclops rat, and they get freaked out, then use the cyclops rat, and maybe tie it in with a big beholder - genetic manipulation plot.  Give the beholder a nice big swath of the dungeon, connect him to some other villains, that kind of thing.  Don't think you have to write a bunch in advance to be ready; what you really need is a sense of what the players like, player buy-in, and a sack full of encounters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208409/#Comment_208409" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T18:20:56+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  6:20PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2009 6:24PM by madunkieg.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It varies from game to game, but I like to do a lot. An insane amount, actually.<br/><br/>I like to start with a handout. If possible, I include a few cultural details that the campaign will focus on (money systems or honor explanations, or whatever). I also include the character build process, but leave out lists (skills, weapons, etc.). If there are particular archetypes (aka classes, races, etc.) that I want to limit them to, I list those with descriptions. I'm used to running games that the players don't necessarily know, so I often include the core mechanics (not all the modifiers, but how to roll the dice and how the dice relate to things on the character sheet).<br/><br/>My worldbuilding gets pretty intense and detailed, particularly in the bits that a lot of other GMs might gloss over. Assuming a fantasy game of some sort I like to start with some places and people that might be found on a typical street. Each item is given enough detail that they could provide a mini-side plot:<br/><br/>- a restaraunt or two, not a generic tavern, but something with personality and with staff<br/>- 10 items you can buy from people on the street<br/>- farmers (always have farmers prepared, they're <i>everywhere</i> in fantasy settings)<br/>- a smattering of other shops or people, such as a carpenter, blacksmith, shepherd, and a random passer-by chart<br/>- a local specialty (a food or an industry) for each place I expect to use early on<br/>- a random wandering animal chart (because if deadly monsters wander the places just outside of towns, just how tough are the farmers?)<br/>- A notable "do not do": I do not map out any villages, cities or streets. All these bits I create are dropped in as characters go searching for something of the sort.<br/><br/>Does all this matter? The players seem to think so. They have openly expressed confidence that they can stop and talk to anyone, or walk into any shop in the game setting, and I'll be ready to reward their curiosity with something interesting. These bits also help establish the "norm" for the setting without having to provide a huge, detailed setting description in the handout.<br/><br/>This isn't even into the adventure yet, because a lot of that will emerge from the characters, but I like to add extras here, too, such as actual foods and crafts for the players. The players get to taste what their characters are eating, or try to do what their characters are doing, or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208411/#Comment_208411" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T18:36:57+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  6:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the world information doesn't fit on one page or can be described in thirty seconds, then it's too much and it's impinging on the players' ability to contribute to the setting.

Simply put, I think over-focus on the player characters can go too far, and I define "too far" as being when the GM feels like he/she is only there to serve and entertain the players and doesn't have stakes in the fun.<br/><br/>The GM has a character, too, something that represents the GM's stakes in the game. It's called "the setting," or rather the portion of the setting that represents what the GM is interested in, much the way players make characters that focus on what interests them. The player characters are out to challenge and thereby change the setting. The GM is there to challenge and thereby change the characters. There's a balance to be struck there.<br/><br/>For that reason, and others, I encourage gamemasters to continue the practice of preparing settings in as much detail as they desire, much the way I don't mind if players design their characters in great detail. The GMs won't want to hand the players all the setting details, but a GM shouldn't have to constantly worry about impinging upon what the players want when the GM gives his or her fair share of input into what the story will be about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208670/#Comment_208670" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T00:34:31+00:00" title="May 22, 2009 12:34AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2009 12:51AM by johnzo.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, the stuff you describe sounds pretty cool.  I've played in simmy games like that and when they're well-done they're really like nothing else.  And I like your focus on preparing things for the players to run across, that seems like the best of both worlds -- it gives you the lonely fun of setting prep while remaining player-focused and relevant to actual play.<br/><br/>(and you <i>cook</i> for your players?  damn.)<br/><br/>Couple questions for you tho:  you mention really backgroundy things like honor and coinage -- how much do you expect your players to study that stuff, preplay?  Could someone who really didn't have time to study your setting play in your game?    Do you feel that you get the right level of effort from your players?  <br/><br/>Say the players catastrophically misunderstand a setting detail in the game -- like say they don't kowtow to the nomad queen in the right way and they fatally insult her while her court looks on.  How do you correct them?  Do you just tell them they've done something wrong and let them rewind and try again? (and risk killing your flow and turning the game into a setting lecture.)   Do you explain the error and the handwave what they've said into something more appropriate, figuring that character expertise will trump player ignorance?  (and make your preparation and their responses meaningless?)  Or do you let it ride and teach them the lesson the hard way?<br/><br/>This was the pitfall I hit when I did detailed pre-play setting design -- I'd build these beautiful rococo cathedrals in my head and then I'd  spend a ton of table-time describing the proper way to play in them instead of actually playing in them.  So when I GM nowadays, my approach is that if it wasn't spoken at the table, it's not "real" yet.  I still contribute tons.  Probably the majority of the setting comes from me.  But the players have a voice on setting too.  We all come to the table with mere impressions and ideas, and only actual play can canonicalize those fragments.<br/><br/>(that said, I'm glad you've got your play style figured out.  I'm just relating difficulties I've had with that style, is all.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208688/#Comment_208688" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T05:57:23+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  5:57AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Couple questions for you tho:  you mention really backgroundy things like honor and coinage -- how much do you expect your players to study that stuff, preplay?

One read-through is sufficient. Generally there's only one or two "issues" that I pick out of the setting to include on the sheet, generally something I'm interested in focusing the game on (I get to see the players' character sheets, they get a glimpse of mine).<br/><br/>The second issue you discuss happens all the time, especially since I'm currently running Legend of the Five Rings, a pretty complex setting with some very different cultural behaviours. I use a mixture of techniques, but the main one relies on the setting prep I do. I use encounters with "normal" life in the setting like tutorials, having the behaviour of NPCs be examples of how their PCs should play. I do overlook some player ignorance and rewind only in critical situations. I actually have successful etiquette (and similar skills) rolls produce a rewind, which makes players more relaxed, knowing they don't have to make every word and action described perfect. That actually improves play flow with less confident players.<br/><br/>While I may use simulationism (or rather, the illusion of it) as a setup, I also use it for narrativist reasons, too. Imagine a group of players where one player comes from a horse farm and another player has to fight white supremacists just to walk home. Their sense of "normal" is so different that it's tricky to define drama. By establishing a "normal" in-game, the dramatic action is highlighted (just as evil is easier to show in a setting that has a little good).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208723/#Comment_208723" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T10:33:53+00:00" title="May 22, 2009 10:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2009 10:34AM by Josh Roby.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>Simply put, I think over-focus on the player characters can go too far, and I define "too far" as being when the GM feels like he/she is only there to serve and entertain the players and doesn't have stakes in the fun.

It's called "the setting," or rather the portion of the setting that represents what the GM is interested in, much the way players make characters that focus on what interests them.</blockquote>I should point out that my game-thinking has shifted over to assume GMless or GMful structures, these days.  My first response to you complaint was literally, "Well, why is one guy strapped to the GM role?"  Cause I've got blinders.<br/><br/>But I understand that some folks like "playing the setting" and as such, they should have an equal-weight say in what is 'in' and what isn't.  So if the GM is playing the setting, he should expect the other players to internalize about as much information about the setting as they expect their fellow players to internalize about their characters.  Ideally, the setting is developed in play as much as the characters are (should mention: develop-in-play is my other set of blinders): setting starts with a one-sheet and events of play add detail, qualifications, challenges, exceptions, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208731/#Comment_208731" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T12:49:50+00:00" title="May 22, 2009 12:49PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kev, I prep differently for sandbox vs megaplot.  <br/><br/>For megaplot, I come up with whatever I think is cool.  My enthusiasm for what I've made up tends to enrich play and compel the players to interface with it.  Them poking at what I think is cool unfailingly inspires me to come up with more cool stuff.  Once I know what I want to show, I help the players make characters with reasons to care about what I want to show them.<br/><br/>For sandbox, I do pretty much the opposite.  I prepare almost nothing.  I provide the players a bunch of broad general parameters (e.g. "low-tech, high-magic"), and lots of brainstorms of various things they might do.  I then let them pick what kinds of stuff they'd like to pursue, in terms of activities ("fighting!"), payoffs ("gain cool loot!"), and color ("titanic good vs evil!").  Then I go prep a few individual scenarios that offer that.<br/><br/>I can elaborate on either one of these if it sounds like a good match for what you're after...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208758/#Comment_208758" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T16:13:59+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  4:13PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>I should point out that my game-thinking has shifted over to assume GMless or GMful structures, these days.

All my past experiences with variant GM organization have been frustrating, but the games are getting much better at it, so I'll give them another shot someday. That's another discussion, though.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>(and you<i>cook</i>for your players?  damn.)</blockquote>\nIt's not just me cooking for my players. I've had players bring food, even halt the game for a few minutes to cook something inspired by play. Sometimes they surprise me, challenging me to somehow work into the story whatever odd food they've brought. Crafts, rituals and other activities all serve much the same functions in play, but usually require planning and materials transportation, thus fitting with the thread's discussion on setup and preparation.<br/><br/><b>Kev Perrine</b>:<br/>I suppose it might be better to reply with the question, "what are you hoping to do?"

I'm just asking to ask.  Mostly because I like hearing ideas, procedures ... the "things" of gaming and game play.  The little bits of the hobby like how people might make paper minis  or  what a GM might use for "hero points"  or  how a GM shows maps,  etc... etc...  the many many hows and what's of gaming that people do in their style but never pay attention to or consider that "that thing" they do or their GM does, the thing that's NORMAL to your group, if explained might add to my group's fun level.  Simply changing the method/way and/or physical prop/thing you make or give can add to the fun in minor ways you don't even consider.  Each little tool of the trade thing that a group does or evolves too can often help that fun game be a GREAT game.  Every brick matters.<br/><br/>Also - that said - all this "stuff"... gameplay theory, style and all the prep work and materials ... sharing ideas on that stuff are things I love to do because they help me brainstorm for what I can do to add to my game group.  Also - I'm sort of an office-store geek, in that I like toying with new little prop or play aids for games almost the way a golfer might go find/purchase all sorts of things to get themselves excited about playing.  From magazines, to play aids, etc...<br/><br/>These game aids start with things like your DICE,  and continue with things like using miniatures, poker chips or candy (for Hero Points),  wipe-boards,  what kind of binder or presentation you make/print for the players for a new campaign,  what's on/in that material,   etc... etc...  <br/><br/><br/>I really geek out on talking about the stuff  "surrounding"  the game hobby,  that prep fun is almost as much fun as playing the game to me.  Then PLAYING actually is accentuated  BY  all those toys and tricks.<br/><br/><br/>So... what am I hoping to do?  <br/>Generate at least one great idea to either add directly to my "tool box",  brainstorm and test a new thing/idea,  or potentially GIVE some of my ideas to other people.  All the while looking for tricks and tips to make the game potentially more entertaining for myself and players.<br/><br/>make sense?<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208788/#Comment_208788" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T07:07:00+00:00" title="May 23, 2009  7:07AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes perfect sense to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
