However, many items in roguelike games are single-use. Not "potions of healing"--that's done within the Token economy. Rather, something like a "Scroll of Recall" (return to Home, if in dungeon; return to last point in dungeon, if Home). Basically, an Adventurer has plenty of means to restore Traits or repair Gear, through the Token economy; but I can't get my head around how to price single-use, non-quantitative effects.<br/><br/><b>Help me figure out a way to cost such Gear--ideally, a "meta-cost" methodology, rather than a laundry list of brainstormed Gear functions with flat Token costs.</b><br/><br/>Brainstorm, spitball, build a meta-costing method--I'll take any help y'all can give. I've been stuck on this (probably last) game element for quite a while.<br/>Thanks!<br/>David                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132410/#Comment_132410" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T14:36:41+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  2:36PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IMO There's no satisfying mechanism for balancing one-off narrative stuff with mechanical stuff that I can think of.

One must "narrate" any Trait or Gear use (or Stunt). The issue I face is setting a fixed costs for a static ability (used once or not) against a system where there's variable costs for variably effective ability. I've had the same issue in GLASS, and I solved in there with the caveat: "The base cost from which all others are measured is how much it takes to kill a normal human of Health 4." That made Slay (static) cost the same as Harm Directly 4 (level-based).<br/><br/>I need that measuring stick, here, and I'm really stuck on where to even begin; "[pricing] it as [I] see fit" is precisely the problem: I don't see any fitting metric, yet, to take into a playtest.<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J.%20Scott%20Timmerman" title="J.

Now divide the cost of an infinite-use item by this number.  Of course, after that, you can map these costs into whatever cost-system you have in your game.<br/><br/>If you think it would have varying usefulness in different situations, but would still be useful, only count the predicted less-useful situations as say, half an instance of usefulness each when finding that number.  For instance, a firebomb might be very useful for starting a rock slide or fighting an ice monster.  It would be only somewhat useful for fighting something less vulnerable to fire or explosions, but still better than not having it.  Another example of this might be diminishing returns.  In case an infinite-use item would become less useful as the game goes on, the player may just end up using the single-use item at the beginning, when it's most useful.<br/><br/>-JT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132714/#Comment_132714" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T13:13:27+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  1:13PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AND Story Games eats another fucking half-hour-long, fine-tuned post. Goddammit.<br/><br/>Dude, I ain't got the energy to explain again all the ways that your suggestion misses the point. I'll try to summarize:<br/>I don't need "charges" or "ammo" for or "applicability" of Gear. The first two are not in the game; the latter is handled by Challenges.<br/><br/>My issue is that some thinks work or don't work--are non-quantitative--and as such I need a means to cost them against quantitative effects (which I got covered). Scroll of Recall works every time: there's no "roll for success(es)" or variable resultant effects. It just works; but it provides a significant benefit tot he Adventurer (avoiding all intermediary Zone between current position and target position, which are places that the Opposition could set up more Obstacles, if they wanted to... and they do).<br/><br/>So even if I presume "infinite use" of ever such item, I still have to deal with the fact that such effects don't fit on the quantitative continuum already established for variably-effective elements. So I am stuck on how to make a "fair" cost for things that have effects "above and beyond" the conflict-level, measurable effects.<br/><br/>Not a simple task. I don't have a convenient "standard" (yet) like the one that I used to cost-balance GLASS effects that are binary and non-quantifiable (see above).<br/><br/>Thanks for the idea, though... check out the rules, if you can't quite grok the distinction I am trying to make in this post;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132716/#Comment_132716" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T13:24:34+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  1:24PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2008 1:27PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's no good analytical method. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Hero system, being immune to aging costs 3 points. In GURPS it costs 100 points (the systems are comparable in terms of currency). <br/>\n<br/>\nJason is sorta right. In that it really depends on just how often the thing is going to get used. The problem in the Hero and GURPs example is that you really don't know if aging is going to come into play as a part of the challenge of keeping your character alive (Hero assumes that it will only as a "special effect" of other powers, and GURPS has detailed rules for aging). Do we play at the rate of one day of game time per hour of play, or one year of game time per hour of play? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a character is doing well, and doesn't need to go back to town for anything, the scroll of recall is useless to him, and worth nothing. To a character who is about to die from starvation, has broken equipment that needs repairs, or whatever the town can provide for him, the Scroll of Recall is priceless. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you're left with Ryan's method. Guess a price that feels reasonable intuitively. Do players buy them? If the buy too much, raise the price. If they never buy them, lower the price. Let market effects determine your cost in playtest. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might not represent the "real" value of such a thing. But, then, the "real" value is probaby not nearly so important as the percieved value. Which is what you determine via the market value method. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. If, in fact, the Scroll is pretty much neccessary to be used once per X turns or something, then don't worry about it's real or percieved value. Set it's price based on how much gold you want to take out of the economy on a regular basis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135817/#Comment_135817" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T09:14:24+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  9:14AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points, Mike... and as it turns out, I have stumbled upon the solution I am going to use: it was there in front of me the whole time:<br/><br/>The World Creation follows a basic "pay a Token for anything" rule, with a balancing "pay a Token to start a Challenge" rule. And that's just how I'm going to do one-offs or non-quantifiable effects.<br/><br/>Adventurer "finds" a Scroll of Recall (pay Token). If any Opposition objects, start a Challenge (pay a Token). Blind-bidding ensues, all bid Tokens are lost, one bids either "for" (right hand) or "against" (left hand) the introduced Device (new term). Highest total Tokens wins.<br/><br/>This way, the players can introduce nearly anything, as needed, but are checked by other players who might not like the "shortcut" or the change of story direction or whatever. As such, the value of any such Device scales automatically, based on perceived utility (and influenced by the current Token balance in the game). Early on, no one will care about Recall; later, it will be hotly contested as the Opposition feels itself on the verge of killing the Adventurer.<br/><br/>I think that's Golden. And if it works out in test... ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a> is out of alpha and into beta testing (balance and tuning)....<br/><br/>Thanks, folks, for your time!
