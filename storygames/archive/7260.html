Think of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, the anti-hero's quest in Vanishing Point, the truth of what happened in Run Lola Run, or the protagonist's view of his own life in Memento.  I'm also told Two-Lane Blacktop has some similar elements.<br/><br/>I started thinking about it when I realized how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logocentrism" rel="nofollow">logocentric</a> most roleplaying is.  So often it's about achievement, discovery, resolution, and meaning.  I started to wonder what a game would look like if it weren't about those things.  This is a primitive version, but, for me, somewhat of a revelation.<br/><br/>---------------<br/><br/>Pick a setting.  Present day works well, but choose whatever you like.<br/><br/>Pick a name for your character.  Make one comparison with each of the other characters.  (EDIT: Each comparison represents one way your character is <i>different</i> from someone else.)  Don't nail down any other details until the game starts.<br/><br/>Pick a goal that won't be accomplished in this story.<br/>Pick a conflict that won't be resolved in this story.<br/>Pick something that won't be introduced in this story.<br/>Pick a question about yourself that won't be answered.<br/>Pick a question about the plot that won't be answered.<br/><br/>Frame scenes as you choose.  Focus on scenes where the absence of the things you've chosen becomes obvious.  Use plenty of evocative details in your descriptions.<br/><br/>There are no resolution procedures.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161433/#Comment_161433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T09:45:02+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  9:45AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

It's not rocket science.  This is how you resolve all sorts of conflicts, be it on the player, character, or world level.  I usually have this conversation after about 3 sessions of play, where everyone has identified which conflicts they think are great and which make them want to shoot themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161532/#Comment_161532" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T15:07:55+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  3:07PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2008 3:11PM by Max Higley.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>For instance, how to resolve the conflicts that aren't the central unresolvable conflicts.

Otherwise, assume anything said is true -- everyone has authority.  There's no incentive to abuse it, because you won't be accomplishing anything anyway.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tomg</cite>So how do you avoid conflict?</blockquote>\nYou don't have to.  You just don't resolve the ones you've agreed not to resolve.  Scenes about conflicts that don't resolve can be pretty fascinating, even (and especially) if they recur.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>stick an endgame procedure in there and playtest it this weekend!</blockquote>\nEndgame procedures defeat the point: the end isn't supposed to have any meaning.

I find good movies and books do that too - beyond the experience, the questions keep running through my head.<br/><br/>But surely you need end game, not for meaning, but so you can finish the experience and have those questions still going? Otherwise the game might drag on - people get distracted and bored - they say 'lets finish it next week', but nobody can make it and it never really ends, or they don't know when to end it and people just start playing playstation - the questions just fizzle out. End game is needed to sever the game, yet retain the energy of the questions, or however you might put it, surely?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161596/#Comment_161596" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T22:50:57+00:00" title="August  8, 2008 10:50PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I showed this to a friend earlier today, and he thought something was missing.

Of course, the train can't be late, because that would introduce it into the story.  But a scene at the rail station makes no mention of the Train from Pasadena, so that would be fine.  If you want to imply that the train might be late without introducing it, say that there are two people at the station waiting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>The game as written lacks a sense of pace in its mechanics.

Games are frameworks we create to help us experience something. I really, really, really want to experience exactly what Max is proposing with his game. But I think that the framework is incomplete, meaning that it wouldn't help me experience this IN THE WAY THAT I WANT IT TO.<br/><br/>There are theme mechanics and character creation mechanics and I'd call "narrate its absence" as being mechanical to. The final mechanical component that this game feels like it needs to consistently deliver the experience it promises are rules about the pace. Even if to say "play between the time you order food and the first plate arrives. When someone's plate touches the table you immediately end the game." That would be dope. Even if to say, "Decide between yourselves before play when the game will end" or "you aren't allowed to discuss before playing when the game will end. The game ends when someone leaves the room."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161643/#Comment_161643" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-09T09:02:03+00:00" title="August  9, 2008  9:02AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2008 9:05AM by Max Higley.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's something I've been struggling to express and dancing around:  In my mind, part of the experience of the game is to see how long you can withstand the meaninglessness before you can no longer resist the impulse to search around for something with meaning.  For that reason, I hesitate to set either a time limit or an external end condition, even one unrelated to the game itself.  It might prevent you from exercising your full capacity.<br/><br/>Still, I see what you mean about not ending formally, so try this on for size:  When you can't take it any longer, and the impulse to inject meaning or quit is overwhelming, say "I'd rather do something meaningful" and quit playing.  The game ends when all players have decided they've had enough.  (This means that the game could continue with one player, for as long as they can take it.)<br/><br/>As for pacing, I still prefer that to be left open.  The scenes should be similar to the whole game, but on a smaller scale -- they go as long as it seems like they should, until you have the impulse to change and do something else.  The constraints should make it difficult to use changing scenery as a way to do something meaningful, but the temptation will certainly be there, and maybe it's possible -- but hopefully only in ways that highlight absence instead of presence, which I think is pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161669/#Comment_161669" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-09T11:56:14+00:00" title="August  9, 2008 11:56AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite>Still, I see what you mean about not ending formally, so try this on for size:  When you can't take it any longer, and the impulse to inject meaning or quit is overwhelming, say "I'd rather do something meaningful" and quit playing.

Because if you play until you get frustrated, that's the meaning of the game: getting frustrated.  And that's not my intent either.  You could just, you know, quit playing when you feel like the time is right, either because events in game have gone far enough, or because you'd rather do something else.  Also, if this game in particular isn't satisfying, perhaps you could take the idea of absence flags that you play to create tension with and work it into other games, new or old, to make them do what you want.  I'm not too dead set that people play it as written, because it needs revisions to be playable.  This is just a proof of concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on that topic, first playstorming last night.  The setup is all wonky.  In particular, the order you choose things that won't be introduced can make it way easier or way harder, and also way more realistic or surreal.  I suggest the following order: pick names, then the thing, conflict, goals, character questions, plot question, and finally figure out how the characters are different.  This order allows you to pick things that go together easily enough -- but they have to be things that don't rely on each other, so that you can play around the absence of each.  If, for example, the conflict depended on the thing, then since the thing won't be introduced, you've automatically avoided the conflict.  Also, it's tempting to turn the plot question into another conflict, by asking a question that starts with "will."  Why works better, what is probably next best.  When and how don't work out as well, but you might be able to find ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example set up:<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters - Tom and Julie<br/>\nThing - Grandfather's cider press<br/>\nConflict - An unpaid debt<br/>\nGoals - (Tom) Find a way to pay his rent, (Julie) Get the family together for the holidays<br/>\nCharacter questions - (Tom) Why does Tom value loyalty so much?, (Julie) Why is Julie so paranoid about Tom's motivations?<br/>\nPlot question - Will Julie make it to her job interview in Chicago?<br/>\nDifferences - (Tom) more defensive, (Julie) more hardworking<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conflict can come up, but won't be resolved.  The goals can come up, but won't be achieved.  The questions can come up, but won't be answered.  The trickiest part is finding a way to make a scene about a thing, but without introducing it.  For this setup, a scene with the two characters sitting on the porch works well.  It's easy to imply the cider press in any number of ways, without actually introducing it.  Here, you could make the scene about the cider press by, for example, talking about how grandfather's things were divided when he passed away.<br/>\n<br/>\n[A rule of thumb: don't introduce anything that directly depends on the thing you're avoiding.  In this example, grandfather's house is perfectly cool, while cider would not be.  If the thing we weren't introducing was an airport, then you could mention a destination (since getting there doesn't necessarily require an airport), but you wouldn't introduce a flight (since those almost always land at airports.)  It's a little bit tricky at first, but it's doable.]<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther notes as I experiment more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
