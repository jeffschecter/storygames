I don't play opposite-gender characters very often, because I am a deep-immersion-style player, and there are some things I just can't get into, in that I feel I can't do them justice. I have similar problems with real-world cultures, which is why I tend to play North Americans of European or Aboriginal descent (like me). I don't have a problem with it in fantasy settings, because I feel there's a lot more licence to improvise.<br/><br/>A lot of this emerges from the fact that in the past, I've  been at the table with people playing female characters or characters of a different culture who would do horrible, stupid, or stereotypical things, often to the detriment of the group, and when asked, responded "well, [group x] would do that; they are just like that." I try not to be that kind of player.<br/><br/>When I run a game (which I usually do) I have two defences against this kind of behaviour: the first is that my NPCs tend to be walk-ons, defined primarily by their relationship to the PCs. I don't spend a lot of time putting their character development front-and-centre, unless the PCs seek it out, because this is time to play a game, not time to listen to me talk about my kewl NPCs. The second defence is that I get to play a wide variety of cast members, so if I feel I am descending into stereotype territory with one character, I can always balance it out by playing another against the stereotype, or by having another character "lampshade" the activity: "Oh, yeah, Col' Dub is great for information, but he's also doing what he can to live the textbook rasta gangster lifestyle. You learn to live with it."<br/><br/>That all said, there will probably come a day soon where I might start toying with the idea of expanding my character box. I already have been pushing the boundaries by trying to play characters with genuine faith (something I totally don't relate to). Who knows what might be next?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228944/#Comment_228944" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T10:29:47+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 10:29AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if I count, because I will elect to play male characters under rare extenuating circumstances-- an overwhelming bias towards just female characters, for example, or if playing a male character will hinder/enable romantic subplots due to gender and sexual preference mix. But I vastly prefer to play female characters.<br/><br/>I do GM on occasion, and when I do, I of course play male and female characters. I think I do a decent job playing a guy, since I had a ton of experience doing so in high school, but it's just less fun for me, since I had a ton of experience playing male characters in high school. (I wasn't allowed to play female characters; only the guys were, because they said my portrayals of females were "unrealistic!") <br/><br/>So it's probably my own baggage. I'm sure a few years down the line I might enjoy playing male characters again, but right now I'm still enjoying the luxury of playing my own gender.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228950/#Comment_228950" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T10:35:08+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 10:35AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The folks that I know who play female characters horribly don't do such a good job with male characters either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228953/#Comment_228953" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T10:39:54+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 10:39AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 10:40AM by Tristan.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny thing is you got me thinking...<br/><br/>I haven't played a female PC, ever (unless you count this one session of BtI).

When my character got stuck in jail and had her pants taken from her (so she didn't use them to try and scale the wall or something?), the DM asked me what I was going to do. I started hatching an escape plan. Everybody laughed at me. "Girls don't make plans, they seduce the guards. Seduce the guard!" "But I don't want to seduce the guard, I want to make a daring escape and kick the guard's butt," I explained. "Man, you're not allowed to play girls any more. You don't know how girls act!" was the unanimous response.<br/><br/>I didn't think much of it. I figured this was a made-up world and, being new to the game, how was I supposed to know how girls acted inside of it? So I just played guys. I didn't play during college, and when I found a white wolf group once I was married, the ST asked me why I was playing a guy. "Oh, my old group said I sucked at playing girls, and so I wasn't allowed to," I said. The guys all looked at me like I was nuts, declared that stupid, and made me play a female character. I've enjoyed playing sans Y-chromosome ever since, and haven't had any complaints about my characterization, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228984/#Comment_228984" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T11:45:05+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 11:45AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, so the problem was that you weren't whorish enough.

I've never played a female PC before (but then, I've GM'ed much more than I've played). I keep fearing that I'll do it wrong; that despite appearances, some things motivate women that I simply do not understand. I try to avoid the stereotypes, I try to avoid the misogyny, but sometimes it seems so subtle to me that I feel certain that something I'll consider no problem at all, will actually reveal me as an ignorant, privileged male. I've heard the argument many times that, "But you'll play an elf, is that any less alien?" In fact, yes! Sure, in theory, elves belong to an entirely different species, with different traditions and live for centuries. But really, they're just us middle class, twnetieth century American white men with pointy ears. Besides, I don't know any elves that my performance might alienate or offend. I can't say the same for women.<br/><br/>I do play some female NPC's when I run games, though. But since they only appear as NPC's, they really shouldn't get enough spotlight time to highlight my inadequacies. The spotlight should stay on the PC's. If any of my NPC's, male or female, gets that kind of screen time, I've screwed something up, I say.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeffrey Straszheim</cite>I'm not really the target of this question since I play girls quite frequently.  The thing is, I don't understand the difficulty.  It seems easy to .. uh .. just play a girl.  I mean, unless you're the sort to fall into the "lesbian stripper ninja" trap, which is easy to avoid, what is the difficulty?</blockquote>\nIs it easy to avoid? Are you sure? For every obvious offense, you'll find a more subtle one that maybe you didn't consider offensive, but an actual woman sure as hell would. And how do you know until you've made the offense? I don't worry about the "lesbian stripper ninja" trap, but, for instance ... I make my characters vulnerable, because that adds to the drama. And with a male PC, I wouldn't think twice about it. But with a female PC, now I have to worry, have I just gotten sucked into the same old, misogynistic fairy tale about the vulnerable princess in need of rescue? If I go to the opposite extreme, have I made her butch and manly, and thus played into the idea that you can't be feminine without being vulnerable? It just goes on and on like this, so instead of playing, I spend the night worrying and never doing anything. Which furthers the stereotype that women are passive rather than active. Argh!<br/><br/>Sure, in my group, I'd probably only offend myself\u2014I shudder to think back to the discussion at our game on Saturday night\u2014but you can't hide it from yourself when everyone goes home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexS" title="AlexS"><img alt="AlexS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4284/as32px.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexS">AlexS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229034/#Comment_229034" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T14:22:34+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  2:22PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 2:23PM by AlexS.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our group we usually don't play PCs from another gender.

As for myself, I was criticized for playing my characters identically, regardless of their gender, i.e. the others thought my female NPC was just a man with a skirt, or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n[*] Impediment to immersion. Some people had a hard time remembering that the guy next to them was actually impersonating another gender, and this led to all kinds of mix-ups.<br/>\n[/ulist]<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a GM this was never an issue, simply because an NPC never has the same weight as a PC, in terms of talking time or emotional involvement, etc. As a GM, you impersonate an NPC for a few minutes at a time, as a PC, you're doing it for hours. It's just incomparable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow in Breaking the Ice it worked nicely, but this is I suspect because we both exchanged ours genders, and there were only two of us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229056/#Comment_229056" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T15:46:09+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  3:46PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should probably point out, as a follow-up to my comment above, that I played the Lady in a recent game of <i>Lady Blackbird</i> and felt no awkwardness or resistance whatsoever, despite in-character flirting from other PCs.

We've already got a nice, nearly-evenly-mixed party if everyone plays their own sex (barring the GM, of course, but NPCs tend towards an even mix, too).<br><br>Some of the other reasons are probably influencing it, too, like the fear of "getting it wrong" or "MY IMMERSION!" or "I can't do the voice" or whatever, but I don't think any of those have as much impact for us as simply already having plenty of both men and women at the table.<br><br><br>Now, the weird thing is this: the most over-the-top, aggressive, macho characters we've had in our games have been, without exception, female PCs played by female players.  And the most devotedly romantic, deeply sensitive, nurturing PCs?  Almost entirely male PCs played by male players.  So there's a lot of bending of stereotypical gender roles going on, even if no one is actually officially playing a PC of the opposite sex.  (And this is why I made a point of saying "opposite sex" rather than "opposite gender" in the first paragraph.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229079/#Comment_229079" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T16:22:42+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  4:22PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite>I can always balance it out by playing another against the stereotype, or by having another character "lampshade" the activity</blockquote> When this is available, it provides an important safety valve against getting offended/offensive.

A lot of character elements aren't really gender-specific, particularly for heroic characters who are challenging the world.<br><br>I do GM a lot, and of course I have to play many female NPCs. In such cases, I pay close attention to the culture within the game and how it constructs gender. The more heroic/strong the female NPC is, the more likely I'll deviate from that gender construction and focus more on the character's individual drives. Admittedly, I do this with male characters, too (and other genders, e.g. some cultures don't differentiate between boys and girls below a certain age, they're just children).<br><br>I suppose my suggestion would be to think about how you choose to play any gender, to consider the ramifications of how you play. EDIT: as an extra suggestion, it's also good to be forgiving of those who sincerely try to play well but make an occasional mistake.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229095/#Comment_229095" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T17:21:52+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  5:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it just me or is this thread totally graphically busted?

It was a long campaign and it really went well. I think that if you don't fall into exploitation, there is really no worry to offend anyone. There is soooo a wide range of gender stereotypes and expression out there. I mean there is not one "right way" to play a female or a male character. One of my player played a more "vulnerable" introverted female character and a other one played a more extroverted character who could have been described as his "usual male character in skirt" (the third player kind of felt in the middle). But it was nice, I had nothing again it, all of those three character were believable characters, some more feminine, some more masculine, all of them tackled with interesting issues, some related to their gender, some not. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the GMing, I think there is no harm in interpreting a female (or male) NPC as more feminine or as more masculine as long as you don't interpret all your female or male NPC the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229117/#Comment_229117" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T20:00:54+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  8:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeffrey Straszheim</cite>(Don't get me wrong.

I don't know that I can answer the actual question posed. I can't put myself into the mindset of being unable to play a female character. I've become passingly aware that it's sometimes considered slightly deviant behavior, but I've never had anyone really react to my playing a female.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play female PCs all the time. Well, more literally, quite often. I shrug it off when I play a video game and say "the view is better," but I just happen to like playing female characters. I've played anywhere from wanton slut (usually in video games) to frigid ice princess in the sexuality department, but they almost always tend to be capable and confident, though there is some attraction to playing the shy wallflower, too. I don't *think* I play them as men with different parts (i.e. the gender equivalent of humans with funny ears) though a few old standbys do tend to be tomboyish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result of this, I don't ever have an issue with playing female NPCs. I once got the somewhat disturbing compliment when playing V:tM from a first-time gamer after a hours-long roleplayed "interrogation" that after a while, he stopped seeing me sitting there, and started seeing the female character I was playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still get a little shy of romance/attraction when I play female characters. I'm okay with casual in-character flirtation, but if it gets even vaguely serious, I'm like to start getting uncomfortable. This happens less often when I play online, and even less when the player of the male love interest is played by a female. I think this is a comfort issue, and with a group where I'd be able to play seriously without worrying about anyone cracking a gay joke, I'd probably be okay with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold" title="kaptainkobold"><img alt="kaptainkobold" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold">kaptainkobold</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229133/#Comment_229133" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T23:15:58+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 11:15PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played a female character in an RPG for ages, but I play one in real life sometimes :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229143/#Comment_229143" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T01:30:24+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:30AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have a problem with playing female characters, but I tend to unnerve people if I do so I stick to men.<br>I've never been one to worry about accidentally displaying stereotypes. Most of my male characters are raging stereotypes of something, so there's some kind of twisted equality there.<br>I used to know one guy who always played female characters, every single time. Problem was you couldn't tell because they all acted the same and he had a very deep voice which he didn't bother trying to disguise (which was probably all for the better really). Anyway, his female characters acted just like his (very few) male ones so it didn't really make any darn difference what we called him. <br><br>Funny thing, most RPGs point out that their worlds don't really suffer sexism, probably to avoid pissing off female gamers, and under those conditions does it really matter if you're playing a man or a woman?<br><br>Personally I hope to run Witch Girls Adventures sometime soon. Forcing all the players to take the parts of prepubescent girls should shake them up a bit mwahaha.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
