I played in the "Fires over Omac" 4-hour demo at a convention this spring, right after having played a short intro to the Burning Wheels "Gift" demo. The BW game was awesome - Duel of Wits, dwarves vs elves, insults (veiled or otherwise) flying back and forth, even though <i>there was no conflict</i>. It was great.<br/><br/>In Fires over Omac, I'm suddenly sitting here with this totally alien setting, an R-map of people I didn't know, a character sheet of some race I don't know what the hell it is or what they do, and I'm being asked what type of scene I want to play next. "Huh? Pass..." I passed a few more times, trying to figure out wtf was happening. Eventually, I decided I wanted to do something and the GM says, "No, then you have to use a Building scene". So I use a Building scene and I do something, and the GM looks up about 14 different rules to decide how many dice I should roll. So I roll the dice, but the traitor dice don't meet the obstacle. So, um, nothing really happens.<br/><br/>It keeps going like this, with everyone announcing scenes and playing them without much happening but colour (except during Building scenes, which are handled via a single roll and a short RP session), until the big firefight. The firefight basically boils down to a boardgame, except <i>there is no damn board</i> so I have no idea what is going on! The fact that I don't know the rules to the boardgame - i.e. the maneuvers, what skills they're based on, and what they do mechanically - just makes things worse.<br/><br/>Here's my dilemma. I want to love this game. I went out and bought it afterwards because I wanted to find out exactly what went wrong, and slugging through 650 pages of rules even though I didn't have anyone to play the game with seemed like a good idea at the time.<br/><br/>So I have two questions.<br/><br/>1. Where is the awesome in Burning Empires, and<br/>2. What went wrong at the demo at the convention?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84777/#Comment_84777" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T13:45:31+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  1:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2007 1:48PM by Andy.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rather than create a giant thread for everyone to pile in with their own experiences and games, I think it's perfectly legit to, say, rename this thread: "Help me understand Burning Empires!" and make this a thread about you alone and your questions and understanding.

Now that I see the thread's been renamed I'll take a very quick stab at your questions.<br/><br/>1: The awesome in Burning Empires: We got a lot of awesome out of Burning Empires from how all the little moving parts locked together. This is not obvious from merely reading the book, and even limited play may not reveal how it all comes together. But basically it's the interface of the Scene Economy, the Infection, and the Artha Cycle. <br/><br/>The Scene Economy places hard, indeed <i>highly artificial</i>, limits on player activity. These limits are very nontraditional, but they absolutely do create a strong sense of comic-book pacing. You get a scene where you're just talking. He gets a scene where some awesome new tech gets introduced. She gets a throwdown with a bad guy. Work out the math and you'll see that scene are, literally, 10 minute increments of play. Conflicts are longer, obviously. Your demo person should have understood why the scene economy is in place -- to restrict GM activity to the same baseline as the players, and to mandate even spotlight time.<br/><br/>The Infection is pretty problematic and continues to be a source of controversy. Irrelevant to the Omac scenario so I'll leave that for a later discussion.<br/><br/>Finally you have the Artha cycle. If you've played a BW demo you probably got a taste of this. The BE system is very similar but not identical to the BW system, but it's close enough for government work. Hit your Beliefs, Instincts and Traits (BITs) and you get paid various flavors of Hero Points for doing so. Pretty uncontroversial storygame type stuff. <br/><br/>The moving parts intersect and create awesome in the following way:<br/><br/>* You'll get to make three rolls. THREE. That's it.<br/>* You will have about 30 minutes of spotlight time to push your agenda. There will be a chance to introduce new "soft" facts to the game via Color, and a chance to communicate with someone via Interstitial. Every fact counts, every conversation counts, every roll matters.<br/>* You will be forced to decide whether your personal agenda is more valuable to you than the greater good of your "side".<br/>* And finally and most awesome, the GM is faced with similar decisions and restrictions.<br/><br/>The net result is 3 hours (at 10 minutes/scene average x 3 scenes x 6 characters) in which every decision by every player is focused on the big question of the game: Do my own shit or help humanity? Or, if you're very clever or lucky, both.<br/><br/>IMO the awesome only comes out after multiple maneuvers played at a very fast pace. The game plays better with 2 maneuvers in a session, because it sets up a very nice setup-resolution pace to everyone's plans. Also, over multiple maneuvers you start to get a better sense of the ebb and flow of Artha: You work on your own stuff and get points, then you spend those points to help your side's abstracted plans (or not, if your plans are more important to you than your side's shot at winning the Infection -- the game has an implied "players decide what winning means to them" element, although that is also a controversial point), then you go work on your own stuff, and so on.<br/><br/>Other specifically awesome bits: the Firefight! mechanics are an inspired way to scale warfare up and down indefinitely. Just beautiful. The Technology Burner is a very well-balanced and clever way to introduce new gizmos to your game. The World Burner itself gets everyone invested in a cooperatively created setting. <br/><br/>None of this comes through a one-session demo, except maybe the coolness of Firefight!<br/><br/>2. What went wrong at your demo? No idea, other than to suggest that your demo person either wasn't experienced with BE or hadn't really deconstructed it and worked out why it does what it does. The highly artificial restrictions on who gets to do what and when is outright upsetting to many trad players. It is one of many elements of the game that are anti-immersive in the "you are there" sense, although there are so many decisions that my players, at least, are very much fully immersed in the game experience at all times.<br/><br/>Hope this helps,<br/><br/>p.<br/><br/>p.s. you might also check out my "getting through the first turn" Wiki post that I have linked in my sig at the BW forums. Same username. It's been useful for BE GMs trying to piece it all together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84787/#Comment_84787" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T14:18:09+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  2:18PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our group found BE very difficult too, and we also loved the game and were very excited to play.<br/><br/>Getting together and designing your world as a group, coming up with the key characters and so on is very important. That's how you get engaged with the game. I can imagine demo-ing certain parts of BE, but just tossing a BE game at someone and expecting them to engage--I can't imagine it would work.<br/><br/>Another important thing is that there's a list of key skills for each phase of the infection. Look at it when you decide who your characters are going to be. The skills are kind of important.<br/><br/>I'd also heartily recommend ramping up. Start with pretty simple scenes and conflicts, do a simple firefight, and give your self time to get used to the rules.<br/><br/>BE, IMHO, is a game that will reward long play (which is why it didn't work for us). Be patient and explore the system bit by bit. That's my 2 cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84790/#Comment_84790" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T14:21:46+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  2:21PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to jump in and say I'd love to see, "Help me understand [x]" as a typical thread here at Story-Games.<br/><br/>The point is, as already been stated, it brings criticism of a game to an interesting place: By talking about specifics and construction, there is a possibility for new understanding.

I've seen a lot thick RPGs that are filled with fluff and weapon porn and after a while you barely need the tome.  Not BE.  There is a lot there.  This is endearing to me.  A steep learning curve reads longevity to me.  I am learning something and growing with the game.  The more practice you get the the better the game is for you.<br/><br/>Be prepared that this game is ALL about the big picture.  Sure your focusing on characters beliefs but the economy of scenes pushes you to forge forward.  Interstitials are a few sentences.  The GM should be pushing forward to get in his scenes and baiting you along.<br/><br/>It's definately not a design flaw.  IMHO This game is fucking brilliant and well deserved of the Best RPG of the year award.  But I think different groups have to find different ways to make this game work for them.  My group didn't like stepping away from the action to burn tech and bring in NPCs midstream so they burned the tech before and used Resources tests during building scenes to call on the tech they already burned, etc.  Some groups get two manuevers a session done and mine can only handle one.  Firefight might be an option that you try later in the game maybe focusing on DoW and other mechanics first. <br/><br/>The key here is that your players have to buy in.  If they don't want to do the work (learning a tough game) then it's going to fall flat.  They have to be jazzed and go in with an open mind.  They have to cast aside some immersive ways.  It's a story game.  It drives a great tale.  Don't expect to do much chatting in character. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Hope this is helpful,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84812/#Comment_84812" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T15:05:51+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  3:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2007 3:10PM by Jon Slack.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the awesome, I'll point at my <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=336773" rel="nofollow">play recordings</a> (soon to be podcasts, working out the kinks).  I hugely enjoy the game, and so do the players.  It's the best game I've ever been involved in thus far.<br/><br/>Burning Empires has a fair chunk of rules to get through, but ultimately we're talking about rolling a pool of 6 sided dice, needing each die to land on a 4-6 for a success, and counting up the successes.  If successes = the amount you need (or more than the other guy's successes, if it's a verses roll) you get what you want.  If not, something else <b>equally interesting</b> happens. That's an important piece. Failure is two directions, and both must be awesome.  <br/><br/>You have a very limited amount of scenes where you are front and center in terms of importance.  However, all the other players at the table, including the GM, will invite you into their scenes, so it's not like you throw off your three scenes and then sit there with your thumb up your ass for the rest of the session.  Those players want to talk to you, to get you to help them in their endeavors, and of course looking to you to suggest courses of action or ideas on how to tackle their dilemma.  <br/><br/>For the game to be really awesome, their scenes have to involve you, and your scenes have to involve them, and that's an important piece for anyone playing, to include others, whether as players for advice, or characters for help/discussion/what have you. No one plays in a bubble, the commentary and suggestions and the very important shouts of "AWESOME!" must flow.<br/><br/>The reason I love the limited scenes is because you are guaranteed to have a piece of the game that is all about you.  I've been in a few games where the more enthusiastic drown out the more passive, and as a passive guy it sucks.  This is your golden ticket, system enforced, to do what you want. You pick who you want to help you, or what part of the world you want to detail, or what have you.  <br/><br/>The biggest thing about this game, what I love the most, is that as a GM, the prep time before sessions is the same as the players.  I look at the characters that represent the opposition, consider their beliefs, and make decisions based on those beliefs and what happens in game.  This is exactly what the players do.  No hours of making stat blocks, or designing plot lines, none of that worthless garbage that used to clutter my life.  I sit down, I follow the same rules as the players, and I work hard to get the GM controlled characters to accomplish what they want to do.  In essence, I'm playing.<br/><br/>It is <b>Fucking Glorious</b>.  <br/><br/>For the failed demo, I'll go through the list. \n<ul>\n<li>The GM and players failed to engage you with what was happening on the planet.  Omac is designed to be a bomb in the midst of going off.  You didn't know what was happening, and the GM should have picked up on that right away to help you out.  He didn't assist you or explain things, and therefore he needs a smack.  The players also should have helped as well, and should be punched in the face for not doing so.</li>\n<li>The GM and players failed to help you with the system.  They should have been all over you like white on rice from the first "I pass".  Passing means you don't get what's going on, or don't understand the mechanics, or are not having fun.  This game needs communication between everyone at the table to succeed, and that means helping each other out with what to do next.  You needed to be told what you can and can not do with your 3 scenes, and the fact that you weren't being helped with this I give them another smack, though this time I'm using a crowbar.</li>\n<li>A firefight during a demo is a huge mistake. This is like doing a "Fight" from Burning Wheel during a demo, it grinds things right down.  They should have used a simple verses test. If they really did want to do a Firefight, then the GM should have scrawled a quick and dirty map, nothing fancy whatsoever, just lines and boxes so everyone was clear on the lay of the land.  Plus, Firefights require that you know what you're doing, and it sounds like he didn't.  A broken bottle in the face for the lot of them.</li>\n<li>The GM failed to give you an interesting failure, and the other players failed to suggest an interesting failure.  Rolling the dice opens up two directions.  A success means you get what you want, a failure means something entertaining happens.  If the GM didn't know what to do with the failure, he should have opened it up to the rest of the players (including yourself) for ideas.  Instead you got a chance to roll dice that did... nothing.  This makes me angry, as it is a wasted opportunity to show failure as an interesting new direction.

I've tried reading GM prep type articles about the campaigns they're running, but they tend to be 80% specific to the world they've burned and not particularly useful for my needs.</blockquote>\nI found the chapter synopsis quite useful, and a few people have created some <a href="http://burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3890&amp;highlight=Burning+Empires+rules" rel="nofollow">crib sheets</a> to help with learning the game. <a href="http://burningwheel.org/forum/showpost.php?p=36168&amp;postcount=10" rel="nofollow">This one</a> is particularly useful, it's the one page sheet Paul mentions in the post below mine.<br/><br/>I'd suggest a few things here.  First off, the GM doesn't need to become expert at all the pieces.  I'm a firm believer in sharing the learning with the players.  Ask one player to become familiar with the circles mechanic.  Ask another to get comfy with the technology burner.  Ask a third to become a firefight expert.  Tell the fourth that if he's planning on becoming a psychologist, he should get familiar with the rules on psychology.  One person shouldering the burden of every system in the game is grossly unfair to me.  I still have gray hairs when I tried that with Shadowrun.  <br/><br/>Now, in terms of GM prep, after you construct your three Figures of note, using the same character Burner as the players, the prep is largely over.  All that matters after that point is updating and pushing those figures of note's beliefs, and ensuring that those beliefs run roughshod over the player's beliefs.  If a player wants to build a Dam with his beliefs, then one of your Figures of note will want the dam project halted.  Prep before the game is largely unnecessary once the Figures of note have their beliefs in direct conflict with the player characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84927/#Comment_84927" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T07:31:53+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  7:31AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote one-page cheat sheets for most of the bigger rules sections: end-of-maneuver, all rolling subsystems (circles, resources, etc.).

All I can say is, I have never seen an RPG do a better job of emulating its source material. It's chock full o' rules, but all of them focus on the game's goals, reinforce the setting, and are directly relevant to actual play. If you have not read <i>Faith Conquers</i> or <i>Sheva's War</i>, I recommend you do so. BE is going to give you a campaign that feels like those books. The Infection rules focus the campaign towards an actual dramatic arc without any railroading. For me, Infection was a revelation.

When I said <i>there was no board</i> it was more a statement to the effect that while it played like a board- or a miniature game, there was nothing to truly illustrate "this is what's happening right now, and these are your options".<br/><br/>More importantly, in retrospect, there was nothing that told me "these are the available moves you can make and this is what they do". Instead, I would explain what I was trying to do from a fictional perspective, other players would translate that into a move for me, and then I would find out that such a move was useless under those circumstances. Compare with a D&amp;D dungeon crawl, where I might look at my character sheet and exclaim, "I guess I cast this Mirror Image spell!" just to have the DM look at me weirdly and say "OK, I guess you do... you now have a mirror image for the next 30 seconds, good for you. Poof - there he goes away." These are things that come with practice, but in a demo situation, is there anything one can do to assist players who aren't intimately familiar with the rules?<br/><br/>I think some sort of major Conflict <i>has</i> to be in a BE demo game, because every scene before that seems to lead up to it. It would be terribly anticlimactic to do all those Building scenes just for nothing to really happen in the end.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JonSlack</cite>If not, something else<b>equally interesting</b>happens. That's an important piece. Failure is two directions, and both must be awesome.</blockquote>\nThis is definitely something that was missing. I personally felt that most scenes just fizzled out. Interstitial scenes were the most interesting to me, since I could actually move the story forward and engage the other players/characters without feeling that my effectiveness was tied to that one dice roll.<br/><br/>Paul, your explanation regarding the currency of BE certainly made things click for me. I'm reading "With Great Power..." right now and it sounds similar to the way WGP handles the Struggle between your egotistical and idealistic goals, and the ebb and flow of cards as you increase or decrease the Suffering of your aspects. From an outsider's perspective, to be blunt, at first glance it looks like Luke took BW and slapped scene currency on top of it willy-nilly without considering what it would do to continuity, but I can now see how it ties into the whole Artha economy and the emergent gameplay that would arise from that. Very cool.<br/><br/>Tony, I can totally see how the initial investment of the players in World and Character Burning could make or break this game. Makes me wonder why a demo scenario for BE doesn't include a (very) scaled down World and Character Burning process, rather than a premade world and premade characters. But I guess if it did, it wouldn't be a scenario, would it. Duh. Any alternate ways of generating player investment with a pre-Burnt World and Character set?<br/><br/>eruditus, your suggestion for Tech and Character Burning between sessions is great. One of the biggest screwups with the demo, in my opinion, was the Building scene where one of the more experienced players were searching through the book, assisted by the GM, trying to Burn the coolest weapon for his money. Eventually the GM went on to a Colour scene for someone else while the player did his own Burning, but even so, that player was now disconnected from the game for quite some time until he could finally make his Resources test.<br/><br/>Jon, thanks for your enthusiastic comments and hints. I will definitely listen to your recorded sessions!<br/><br/>For everyone who has linked to play aids, it would be terrific if they were all available in some central repository. The BE wiki seems like a great spot.<br/><br/>Thanks guys!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84965/#Comment_84965" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T10:04:49+00:00" title="August  2, 2007 10:04AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>Dude, did you make that yourself? </blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Brilliant!<br/></blockquote>\nThanks!

They aren't work safe, we curse like sailors and make rude and obnoxious jokes.  <br/><br/>It is a crime that those play aids are not on the Wiki.  I'll have to work on rectifying that.  <br/><br/>And as for the two directions thing regarding failure, it is a central component to building scenes.  No matter what, rolling dice means <b>something happens</b>. In a lot of ways, failure can be better than success.  To give you an example from an Omac game I played in, there was a roll made by the evil Prison Warden to subdue the Lord Steward, in preparation for having him infected with the alien parasite.  The roll failed.  <br/><br/>Now, the Lord Steward was this old guy (and an NPC), and the Warden's massive 2nd in command was trying to subdue.  So what's an interesting failure for this?  I suggested (as a player) that the Lord Steward was accidentally killed instead of subdued.  Everyone said "awesome!".  This ramped up the game, because now the Warden has to deal with the corpse of the Planet's equivalent of the President in her office. Two directions, both directions lead the game to great places.  <br/><br/>I find a great way to involve other players is to have them play some of the NPCs in the scene.  I hand off my Figures of Note to other players to role play with when I need them to meet up and talk to one another, so that I'm never doing scenes where the players just watch (which is the suck).  <br/><br/>World Burning is a really amazing experience.  Everyone creating characters together is really great, so much so that I never want people to create characters in seclusion ever again. There's just so many good ideas and ideas to bounce off each other, and suggestions being thrown around, that it makes for strong, interesting characters, tied to the world and each other, with complementing skills.<br/><br/>It sounded like they really botched the firefight.  It would have helped if they had explained the different combat maneuvers, or even better showed you the firefight sheet that has all these maneuver clearly marked.  Or even just run through a really quick practice firefight, or put the experienced Player next to you as coach to give advice when scripting the firefight maneuvers.  Or even given you choices of maneuvers based on what you wanted to do narratively.  Either way, they should have helped you a lot more than they did.  If they're reading this, they should hang their heads in shame. (I'm less violent today.  Must be my sugar levels)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84988/#Comment_84988" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T10:43:55+00:00" title="August  2, 2007 10:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>In all fairness, there was a rough sketch of the situation, with areas providing Disposition and connections between them.

A rough sketch is what the rules say to do.<br/><br/>I had Firefight cheat sheets for everyone when I did the demo, and it worked out okay.
