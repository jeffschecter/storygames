I play intensively SWM (and hacks), but for this game, the design has taken a lot from SBS. Removing the Overplayer was not difficult for the first four Phases. Its role is less important in Rogues &amp; Discovery Phases, and those first Phases are based on those. The Phases are closed by getting to a milestone set by Motifs, and players move on to the next one. The structure of the game is more rigid than with SWM. It's always the same path. The lack of Overplayer can be felt by playing multiple games with the same people : the same patterns come back.<br/><br/>The last scene, which is a Perilous Phase, was the one who felt difficult at first but got cleared easily. As in SBS, one the players has his role reversed. In SBS, one player will play as the Sorceress, randomly. It's the same here. The Titan will be portrayed by a player for the Fight. It's the Phase I need to be the more precise and explicit in the rules / flow / intent, because the player who will play as the Titan may not have the experience of such a role. A big example is on its way.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" rel="nofollow">NickWedig</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I am also curious about the decision to have the tones switch every phase.

One by Phase, in ordre not to pollute the mind during one Phase. It was my first intent to have each Phase with a different couples of Tones.  The goal is for each Phase to convey different stories, styles, themes. It's something I grab from <i>With Great Power</i>, who have Red / Blue Tones, which are linked to a specific Tone in each Phase.<br/><br/>It's also a Tool I intend to use to "hack" the base game. Having a Titan change one Tone for a specific Phase, or a character Power doing the same. In order to help players grab each Phase Tones, I'm currently expanding the Tones section for each, with examples and guides.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" rel="nofollow">NickWedig</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I like the idea of the Titans having their own tones, though, that intrude into the regular course of play.

Each Titan having 5 Tones is something I got on with the idea that the Dice indicates the Tones to use. Idea that became a Variant, the basic rules will let the player choose. But for some Titans, extra Tones were somehow difficult to express. Also, I primarily write in french, and sometimes it's difficult to find the one-word that convey the same idea.<br/><br/>My playtests have not used all the Titans, and it's something I plan to do : test the Titans and their Tones. However, I want to keep the Titans Sheet light on information. It needs to stay a fast reminder of the Titan, not something you read for minutes. Adding guidances for each of the 5 Tones will go against that goal. But it could be added in the ruleset ?<br/><br/>Also, maybe I did not write that down, but I think the Tones here are set to color a scene, not only to guide the behaviour of the character. Mineral could be used to explore a mine, to center a scene around a piece of quartz. Chivalrous could portray a knight tournament, somebody helping a damsel in distress. <br/><br/>Thanks for your feedback !<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479766/#Comment_479766" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-16T17:16:40+00:00" title="January 16, 2019  5:16PM">January 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also the fantasy superhero version of Sw/oM, Gamma Thrones uses different Overplayer in every Motif!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479792/#Comment_479792" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-17T12:37:54+00:00" title="January 17, 2019 12:37PM">January 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" rel="nofollow">hamnacb</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also the fantasy superhero version of Sw/oM, Gamma Thrones uses different Overplayer in every Motif!</p></div></blockquote>\nWhere can I learn more about this game?

Did you consider this?<br/></blockquote>\nWell ... the list is not complete yet and there will not be 36 Companies. I'm kind of a trickster here, and I use a 21 list with 2d6 (lower dice / higher dice).<br/>During play, the roll is matched against this list and the player who rolls read the Company name. No numbered one (except a few special ones).\n<blockquote><br/>- What certain mechanics instead of putting dice into the midle do you intend to use to make players more involved during everyone's turn?<br/></blockquote>\nThe dice will serve as an interruption tool. As when in a discussion someone wants to shift the topic of discussion. Also, any player will be able to grab them, allowing people that have been "out of the discussion" to step in.\n<blockquote><br/>- Did you already try the game in two? Do you think the game would work well in six with updated speech rules?"<br/></blockquote>\nNo for two. Didn't find the time / people to try them yet. I'm focusing on the 3-5 area. I'll look into it later.<br/>For six players, I think it will work. It works already. But it leads to some players being out of the discussion for too long, especially with a convention group in which we don't know the others. So, as the experience is not that good, I will not endorse it. But it's playable (even at more !)<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>- Aren't you affraid that those transitions, despite being quite cool during first play, will worn-off after a time and feel a bit samey?<br/></blockquote>\nI'm not. Since I've introduced them, they have been very different. And they're short. And they rely on the setting, on the story told. Maybe after a bit I will see it different though.\n<blockquote><br/>- How many playtests did you do until now?<br/></blockquote>\nFive full games, and a dozens tests of just some bits of the game. \n<blockquote><br/>It's a really good job you did there and will keep an eye on this game.</blockquote>\nThanks, that's really appreciated !<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gulix" title="Gulix"><img alt="Gulix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gulix">Gulix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481256/#Comment_481256" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-22T17:48:57+00:00" title="March 22, 2019  5:48PM">March 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.gulix.fr/blog/2019/03/22/warming-up-the-titans/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gulix.fr/blog/2019/03/22/warming-up-the-titans/</a><br/><br/>Some news about how the writing is progressing : good so far.<br/><br/>Also, in order to help teach the game, I'm creating "Warm-up exercises", mini games that will help understand the mechanics of the game.

The failure of the characters is covered in the rules. It could happen, but it's very unlikely (statistically).<br/><br/>I've seen characters having doubts, going (even starting) mad, but not turning against each others. It's not on the table with the basic rules. <br/>When the characters start the Clash (last of the 5 phases), one of them has the possibility to turn down the Clash : betrayal, cowardice or other. One only.<br/><br/>The idea behind that stretch goals (What if you don't slay the Titan) is to provide another framework for the players : putting the Titan to sleep, redirecting it elsewhere, communicating with it in order to live together and other ideas. Not going to fight for death.<br/><br/>But I keep your idea of getting some struggle inside the group.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gulix" title="Gulix"><img alt="Gulix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gulix">Gulix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481943/#Comment_481943" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-13T15:24:08+00:00" title="April 13, 2019  3:24PM">April 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In order to get a little ahead of the curve, I tested the printing process at DriveThruRPG.

Game has evolved and changed, and the text is mainly in french (I'm finishing it, and then translating it).<br/><br/>But you can still try the first draft of the game. It doesn't change much.<br/><br/>Just make sure to choose the Titan at the start of the game (rather than at the first double), and introduce the Reunion Site right away. Then make an entrance for each character (describe of who the character is, and how he arrives at the reunion site). Then it's roughly all the same.<br/><br/>Thanks for the interest, and feel free to ask any questions you might have.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gulix" title="Gulix"><img alt="Gulix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gulix">Gulix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482622/#Comment_482622" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-27T09:29:37+00:00" title="April 27, 2019  9:29AM">April 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Kickstarter campaign is getting closer, and will launch monday or tuesday (still some things to clear up).<br/><br/>You can find <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gulix/427264119?ref=cecocn&amp;token=061f941c" rel="nofollow">the draft on KS</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gulix" title="Gulix"><img alt="Gulix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gulix">Gulix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482720/#Comment_482720" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-29T17:09:54+00:00" title="April 29, 2019  5:09PM">April 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, it's live on Kickstarter : <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gulix/facing-the-titan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gulix/facing-the-titan</a><br/><br/>Pressing the button was not easy, but now it's in the air.
