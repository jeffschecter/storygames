Ellen's gaming experience is very limited. We played one date of Breaking the Ice, and she went to Dexcon with me and played in a few games there. As an aside, she asked me a funny question over the weekend - "Why do people's characters always have things that are, like, the noun of verb or the noun of adjective? Like the axe of brilliance or whatever? It always sounds really silly." I didn't really know what to tell her. I said something about gamer culture and referenced D&amp;D items like the bag of holding. ANYWAY.<br/><br/>Darkpages does something really cool, and instead of playing out scenes cinematically you describe panels like in a comic book. So we were playing out a game based on the old game Underground. I described the first three panels like:<br/><br/>Panel 1: Charles (her character) is on the subway. There's big block sound effect letters of the subway going CHAKKA CHAKKA CHAKKA.<br/><br/>Panel 2: Zoom-in on Charles's face. CHAKKA CHAKKA CHAKKA.<br/><br/>Panel 3: Same shot of Charles's face but behind him is the jungle and he's wearing camo paint and in fatigues. The same CHAKKA CHAKKA is in the background but now it's the sound of bullets firing.<br/><br/>This is way non-standard for roleplaying games, and I actually like it a lot. There's an economy of space, and I have to really think about what I want to communicate in my three panels before I hand it back to her. Since as the GM I want to put her character in hard situations, I have to hammer her since when her three panels roll around she might move the story in a completely different direction.<br/><br/>As a new roleplayer, she took to it totally. She struggled with the rules some, but I struggled too since it's an ashcan and all. We both really loved the panels way of describing action and dialogue.<br/><br/>We haven't hit the point where she's gotten enough pain that her character needs to reincarnate, but we're looking forward to seeing how that works. Especially since she's already interested in rewriting her characters Codes.<br/><br/>I like this game a lot and I hope to write up my Underground imprint for general consumption in the near future.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

I really had to make sure I was hitting what I wanted to hit when the action was getting dense. But there were other times when I felt three was plenty and it let me really spend some time on lots of visuals and details as I stretched them out. There was one point where she was engaged in a dialogue with an imaginary Superman-esque figment of her imagination and I spent three panels describing him in ridiculous superhero poses as he said a few lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>In two hours of play she got about 6 pain and that was even with using her Shadow at one point. She broke her Code once and afterwards was like, "I should get some pain for that I think." The other two times were from pushing failures that would have meant her character's family was hurt (another one of her Codes). The bonus dice do help and picking a new power or element hasn't been a problem so far, though if she pushes does that mean I have to pick a new element too? If so I missed that in the rules.<br/><br/>Oh and I have some questions in the Facebook community but I'll repost them here so this conversation can happen all in one place:<br/><br/>Questions:<br/><br/>Can you hit two codes pretty much simultaneously and cause 6 pain? Ellen has two codes that are almost identical so breaking one means breaking the other. She's already thinking about when her character's next incarnation comes along changing one of them.<br/><br/>In the section on testing against Pain, I wasn't clear on what should be used in the testing - the Avatar rating?<br/><br/>Additionally, Bonds are written as bonuses. Are they used as bonuses to any roll or is that rating just the amount of pain they can take?<br/><br/>Oh, and there's a warning about using Bonds to give you assistance bonuses because that means they can be hit with your pain. Does that mean in those instances the GM chooses where the pain goes?<br/><br/>Also, the Imprint uses the same Advance chart as the PCs. Does it ever reset like the PCs does when they reincarnate?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

YES! My character (Scorn) was even worse. Not breaking one meant breaking the other, so he was fucked whenever that aspect of his code came into play.<br/><br/>2. Pain test = current Pain in the gutter vs. current Archetype rating. OR if it's a bond, Bond rating vs. pain placed on it.<br/><br/>3. Bonds may grant a +1 bonus to a challenge roll if they're part of the challenge. Otherwise, they're just pain sinks and their ratings are the number of points of pain they can hold without testing.<br/><br/>4. Yes. The GM can place some, none or all of the pain earned during the challenge on your bond or helping character(s).<br/><br/>5. Excellent question. I'd say the imprint's advancement chart resets when a new series starts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166600/#Comment_166600" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T10:10:42+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 10:10AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, thanks. I have a couple of other things:<br/><br/>In my reading of the rules for challenges I may have gotten this all wrong, but I was under the impression that only players can call for challenges. The section of the rulebook says "When any player wishes to challenge the GM (or another player...) he may issue the challenge." We felt a bit fuzzy about this at first but decided to go with a literal reading of the rules. So basically I had to either set things up in my panels that I knew Ellen wouldn't like and/or would break her code and cause her character pain.<br/><br/>And as for how we ran challenges:<br/><br/>Ellen's character, Charles, had a hallucination and in my panel I narrated that he took a swing at the hallucination and punched his father in the face (thus breaking his code about protecting his family). Ellen was like whoa there so we rolled, and then we retracted my three panels and she narrated what happened instead. Now, from reading DP posts elswhere I get the impression that that's not how challenges are supposed to be invoked and that instead you call for challenges between panels before the next one is brought into play.<br/><br/>Is this correct/how you intended?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.
