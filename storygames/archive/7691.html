I posted my first ever <b>[PSI=RUN]</b> session, ten days before I planned to run it. There was good respond to the game until I decided to record it as a PodCast, then I had people opting out!(even some small complaints) In the end I got 2 players; Sara, Stephen and Me(<i>the GM</i>). Luckily, three is the minimum number needed to play and a smaller group made for a more intimate game and less discussion; so the game moved very smoothly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe found a quite place in the Hub; a University Caf\xe9. I set up the ICrecorder in a cardboard box with styrofoam and black crape paper over it, this left just the silver, side mics visible and placed a folded black T-shirt under it(<i>less distracting and soften the table noise; dice!</i>). Then we got down to business right away with character design, some game rules and concept discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided to go with the very standard modern setting and the Men In Black ( <i><b>MIB</b> minus the Sci-fi gadgets</i> ) as Chasers working for a massive and diabolical,  Multi-National Corporation. ( <i>Later revealed to be <b>GEN-TEK</b></i> )<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <b>\u201cCRASH\u201d</b> scene was an Avalanche on a treacherous mountain road smashing in to a large, black Semi-trailer Truck (<i>18 Wheeler</i>) causing it to careen over the embankment and bounce, tumble and roll down the ravine.  The wrecked (<i>under carriage is ripped away</i>) Semi comes to rest at the bottom of the ravine near the snowy, wet, half frozen lake.  It is spilling diesel fuel and sparks are flying from the broken engine!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Runners find themselves hanging over the fuel by bungy-cords attached to the crushed roof of the Trailer.  The back doors are torn away with the undercarriage and it miraculously sheared their chains without harming them. They are Free!  <u>Free at last.</u>  But, Wait!  The Chasers may be near, they must <b>RUN!</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sorry, not going to write out the whole story. If you want more please listen to the Podcast! ;0)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>O'Flux</b> aka SteveEG                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ophidian_flux" title="ophidian_flux"><img alt="ophidian_flux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ophidian_flux">ophidian_flux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170809/#Comment_170809" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T18:04:22+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  6:04PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<u><b>[PSI=RUN] Run! Psychic Runners with Amnesia Escape - Part Two</b></u><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Changes and Rule tweaks</b><br/>\nI did my own Character Sheets and a Large Category Sheet for dice placement, which I used colour highlighters on going ( <i>BAD to GOOD</i> ) red, orange, yellow, blue, and green for more visual representation of the categories results. I also laminated it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI changed the Chase and Capture Categories widening them a bit and giving the chasers more bite I think!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>CHASE</b><br/>\n<b>1 : </b>Chasers move Two Scenes closer to the Runners. RED (<i>highlighter colour</i>)<br/>\n<b>2,3 : </b>Chasers move One Scene closer. YELLOW<br/>\n<b>4,5 : </b>Chasers make no progress. BLUE<br/>\n<b>6 : </b>Chasers get stalled &amp; fall back One Scene. GREEN<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>OR</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>CAPTURE</b><br/>\n<b>1 : </b>All Runners Captured. RED (<i>highlighter colour</i>)<br/>\n<b>2 : </b>Half of the Runners Captured. ORANGE<br/>\n<b>3,4: </b>One Runner Captured. YELLOW<br/>\n<b>5,6: </b>Runners Evade Capture. GREEN<br/>\n<br/>\nMy players like the changes and thought that PSI: Brainstorm should only come up on a 1 and have another sub-category result for 2.<br/>\nHhmmm... Maybe:<br/>\n<b>PSI: 2:</b> <u> Mind Surge. People Critically Injured or Killed and Things get Badly Damaged or explode! </u><br/>\nHa! That could be fun, not that the existing categories ever stopped me from killing or blowing things up.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh I almost forgot I changed the <b>Crossroad</b> ( <i>Epilogue</i> ) choices to:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Home, Turn the Tables, The Mission, Hiding, A New Family, Face to Face, On the Run, A Discovery</b> and <b>Lost!</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>O'Flux</b> aka SteveEG                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ophidian_flux" title="ophidian_flux"><img alt="ophidian_flux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ophidian_flux">ophidian_flux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170810/#Comment_170810" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T18:06:48+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  6:06PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<u><b>[PSI=RUN] Run!

I don't look different from other women I pass on the streets or not materially different.  I seem to be of average height &amp; weight.  It doesn't feel like my hair has been washed in a few days, and my clothing is wrinkled.  I think I am an office worker or something less exciting.  I have no pictures of children, though I think I'm young to have them.  No rings.  I don't like the mousy brownness of my hair or the pale almost grey, non-exciting shade of my eyes...  the only thing that sticks out about me is the seemingly painstaking measures of  averageness!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>1. </b>How do I end up in far away places?<br/>\n( Never Answered in game, but it was set as the psi-power question some sort of transportation ability.
