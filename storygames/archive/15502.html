As GM, I may ask leading questions to encourage more depth in player creation, but do not outright create the particular component. The most forward I have been with this is using the "mountain witch" trick. I simply state that there is a person in the scene, or a particular item, or something interesting about the location, and let the players define it. The GM's job is to reincorporate the component into play somehow. In your opinion, is that giving players too much narrative control?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351533/#Comment_351533" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T20:44:54+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  8:44PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know this isn't entirely helpful, but I don't have an ideal game.

Is there a GM at all? What functions does s/he serve?<br/>\nWhat narrative authority does the GM have that the rest of the players do not? What narrative authority do the players have that the GM doesn't have?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs others have said, I don't really think about "ideal games". There may, occasionally, be an ideal game for a particular purpose, a particular group, or a particular time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the function of a GM essentially boils down to two elements:<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) Allowing the players to focus exclusively on roleplaying and/or advocating for their character(s).<br/>\n(2) Allowing the game world to function as a distinct "other" which can be explored/experienced from a viewpoint strictly equivalent to the protagonist(s).<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, to clarify through the negative, as the players take on duties of world creation, world authority, and narrative control they are being tasked with decision-making processes which are not associated with their characters. This means that they're exploring/experiencing the world from an authorial/godlike viewpoint (instead of as an actual person/character would experience or explore that world). It also means that they're frequently not roleplaying while playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Of course, any game session will be filled with lots of time during which people are doing stuff other than actually playing the game. Call it the Cheetos Principle. But, in my experience, there is a distinction between game-related and non-game-related activities and how we process those.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also the issue of continuums. For example, I've met players who really dislike having any narrative control (because they want their game-related decision-making process to remain focused on their character). Some of these players react negatively to strong GM-full architectures (in which everyone at the table takes GM authority over certain aspects of the game world and assume traditional GM roles when those elements come on screen). Others are fine with it. It depends on a complex mix of what they personally find enjoyable about RPGs and STGs; why they find those things enjoyable; what contributes to that enjoyment; and what disrupts or detracts from that enjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo look it from yet another angle: In traditional RPGs there is a very strong distinction between "what the GM does" and "what the players do". As you spread out the traditional duties of the GM, it often becomes necessary to provide additional structure to activities which were originally freeform (and actually became more freeform over time). I've often said that GMs don't notice the distinction between RPGs and STGs as much because their experience is not significantly altered.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Tangentially, it's been interesting to watch that movement then filter back into traditional RPG design -- leaving the GM and his duties intact, but specifically structuring and limiting them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nArguably, however, the result is that the experience of GMing an RPG is then spread amongst all the players... but the experience of being a player in a traditional RPG is actually lost entirely in such games. Not necessarily a bad thing. But something to be aware of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
