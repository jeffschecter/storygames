I am looking for as many different interpretations of the roll as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>My Runner:</b> A tall, thin, young Asian male with a few Questions:<br/>\n<i>Why can I stare at things and make them explode?</i><br/>\n<i>What is under the skin of my right forearm?</i><br/>\n<i>When will the nightmares end?</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Situation:</b>  The Runners are in a bar.  They are trying to remain unnoticed, when their faces appear on the t.v., with a report warning that they are armed and dangerous.  I want my Runner to get himself and his friends out of the bar without being detained.  My Runner is using his Psi Power to cause a distraction to help the escape, and we all agree that Harm is a risk in this conflict.

It's a bad scene.  And through the dingy front window he can see a crappy little import tuner car, a tricked out Honda with a spoiler and decals, and he looks a little harder, and the people are openly talking now and pointing to him and the TV, and boom, up it goes.  Energy released, molecules unbound.  In his head he was imagining a movie-style explosion but it's way, way worse - a chunk of Honda transfer case flies through the window and smacks him in the arm, and suddenly he's behind the bar all folded up, and people are falling in wet heaps, and then there's some fire, and some screaming, but not much of either.<br><br>And he look at his arm, and it's cut open, revealing something metallic, matte black, fused to his bone somehow.  It has a white stencil on it that says 10KT FISSION.<br><br>And then the sirens, and the flashing lights, and it's time to go...                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118336/#Comment_118336" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T12:48:57+00:00" title="January  7, 2008 12:48PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really did this without looking at any other response so we'll see how much overlap there is...<br><br>Queue the mariachi music, slow at first then picking up into full blown lead guitars...<br><br>The group start looking around slowly they begin to notice that others in the bar are noticing the tele.  At first no one equates the people in the bar but in a place like this it's natural to assume that anyone wanted my very well be here.  The price on the PCs' heads get displayed on the screen and your inconspicuous panning of the bar has met the gaze of a ruffian in a leather vest.  He looks at the screen and look at you and back at the screen... Whispering starts flying like a contagion across the bar and you and your friends slowly finish their drinks and backing out of the bar.<br><br>Patrons begin to slowly stand.  Hands go behind backs and under tables and in bags.  You hear a shotgun cock and see that the bartender has pulled his peacemaker out from under the bar.  A scrawny, swarthy man ducks behind a stall seat and desperately dials the number on the screen.  Everyone in the bar hears "We're at the Drunken Whore.  My name's Henry.  'nuff of the questions.  Just get down here damn it!<br><br>FUCK!<br><br>The asian guy starts to sweat, lowers his eyes and the large mirror behind the bar explodes giving the group a split second to run for it.  The amount of firepower in this room is dizzying.  Mugs and bottles are exploding with the amount of firepower that's in the air.  The brand glows brightly under the asian's skin and we can hear a high pitched wine.  Confused he hesitates and as the scene pulls into bullet-time we see rounds start to wobble and sway drawing closer and closer to the asian.  A few nicks and a few close calls as rounds hit beams and chairs around him.  It seems like all the firepower is concentrated on him but none of the gunmen.<br><br>A loud crack echoes over the din of gunfire and the asian's arm explodes as every pellet from the bartenders buckshot rips through the asian's arm.  The man goes to his knees holding the blood stump and seeing some mechanical devise humming away screeching at him.  One of the asian's buddies comes back to get him to his feet.  the man nearly has to drag him out behind the juke box to get cover.  The asian opens his eyes through the pain and they glow an eeie yellow, burning with an inner eldritch fire.  Gunfire stops momentarily - some watching transfixed by the asian's gaze while others are simply reloading.  Then the hairs on their necks start to stand, firearms start to vibrate and all hell breaks loose as rounds begin exploding in their chambers.<br/><br/>The rest had gotten out by this time.  For a little while the bar was eerily quiet as the blonde girl tried starting the pickup with the keys in the ignition.  The wall exploded and flames and bodies erupted from the bar.    From the smoking wreckage of the jukebox their two friends slunk from the bar.  Everyone helped them into the truck's bed and they tore out of the gravel lot sirens in the background.<br/><br/>How's that?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118337/#Comment_118337" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T12:49:23+00:00" title="January  7, 2008 12:49PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!

Nice. I'll play too:<br/><br/>The news people on TV are talking, but there's no sound, just the crash of white noise in my ears. Their lips are moving slower and slower. I can see each of their teeth so perfectly, clicking and snapping with each syllable. They're talking about me. I see my own face floating over the shoulder of the news man, blurred and distorted from the surveillance camera footage. The screen fills with static.<br/><br/>The people in the bar are shouting, waving their arms in extreme slow motion, like deep sea divers. Outside, car alarms blare. Windows are shattered; there's glass in the street. In the distance, the Channel 6 building is on fire.<br/><br/>My arm hurts so much. The inhibitor plug implant (I know what it is now, with strange clarity) has failed, leaving a charred ring of flesh around my wrist and the smell of burnt copper. I know that a trauma associate has been notified and they'll show up in no time to replace the part and give me a pill for the pain.

At first, I attribute this to the stress, the death of friends, and knowing that the Chasers are coming, whomever the hell they are. My friends and I are drinking at the bar, thankful to have a safe place to hide. No one in this dive will turn in their own without something insane to motivate them...<br/><br/>And two things start to happen at once. <br/><br/>First, the images of my face, and the faces of my few surviving friends, the only people I know or remember, begin to flash across the screen.<br/><br/>Second, the tears begin to feel warm down my face, like they're hot coffee pouring from the corners of my eyes. The anger, the fear, the frustration... and the eyes staring at me, as the so-large-anyone-with-a-brain-knows-they'll-just-kill-you-instead-of-paying-you reward echoes at maximum volume through dimly lit bar. Dank and musty as it is, I still feel their eyes burning a hole in me, and all I want... all I want is for them to know my pain.<br/><br/>Then, for an instant, it occurs to me. My face <i>is</i> burning. It's melting, as a matter of fact. The tears streaming off my face are like molten sorrow, and as they stream scars down my face, skin sloughs off, and tiny little craters, like drips of thermite onto an engine block, begin to dig themselves into the bar. The smell of burnt mahogany is intoxicating, and I close my eyes, sob for a moment, then grit my teeth.<br/><br/>I open my eyes, and it seems like time is frozen... until I look around and see my friends behind me, blank, worried stares echoing panic into my mind. I'm covered with blood, and the nerves in my face suddenly alert me to exposed bone. Looking into the mirror, I see some porcelain bonework staring back at me, shimmering brown flames where my eyes should be.<br/><br/>I've cried my eyes out, and the scars are all over my face, neck, and torso. My vision begins to shimmer, and I'm not seeing the world the way others do, I'm sure of it now. I see their faces, frozen in rigor mortis, their bodies defying physics by hanging perfectly in their last momentary gesture. You'd think them frozen, but for the dribbling molten fire slowly trickling from their hollow eye sockets, and a slight shivering in their faces. They're paralyzed in a final moment of torment.<br/><br/>Just like in my childhood. Watching the house burn down around me, too young, afraid, powerless to stop it. I'll never forget the final words my father spoke as the house erupted around me, trapped and crying... <br/><br/><b>"Forget him. He's not worth it."</b><br/><br/><i>The nightmares won't end until everyone knows my pain.</i><br/><br/>We slip from the bar, anyone who could see us or recognize us frozen in perpetual silence. I smile sadly at children, floating in the air, unable to move, breathe, or understand anything past the last moment of play. Knowing the authorities will arrive soon, I ask my stronger companions to wrestle a door open on a truck that had harmlessly come to a stop while the driver drifted into a peaceful sleep. We set him gently onto a nearby park bench, I hotwire the car, and we haul ass out of there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118625/#Comment_118625" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T16:45:07+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  4:45PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want this to end.
