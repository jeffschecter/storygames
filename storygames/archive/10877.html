Apparently, he picked this up from other D&amp;D forums, but it's totally applicable to any sort of campaign game IMO.<br/><br/>Zeroing in on this quote:\n<blockquote><b><i> -Why do you write so much for your players? As a DM you should never tell your players what their characters do or say.</i></b><br/><br/>I got this quite a bit and I understand it comes from a different style of play. I think everyones game is different but my players actually really like it when I write up little stories for their characters. <b>I describe these email skill challenges as being akin to a quick time event in a video game</b>. You provide the most basic sort of input (A button press at the right time or in this case a skill roll) and the story and the action push on. Obviously you can see that my players are free to RP as much as they like. IF they know what they want their character to say they say it. Maybe they are at work though and only have time to log in a quick roll. Well they still get to see their character take part in the action.</blockquote>\nAnd here's some examples of the technique in play: <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/ddemail/" rel="nofollow">http://www.penny-arcade.com/ddemail/</a><br/><br/>Zeroing in on this one:\n<blockquote> <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EMAIL 1:</span> From the DM</b><br/><br/>The man's eyes seem to clear, his posture changes as well. He straightens up and sets his jaw. Raising a hand to his brow he salutes the Warlord. "I am yours to command sir".<br/><br/>Marrek smiles and pats the him on the shoulder. "Good man." he says. "Now here is what I need you to do."<br/><br/>Celence and Gnasc continue to watch the Guards in front of the Inn, waiting for them to leave. Suddenly a filthy man bursts out of an alley further down the street. He's wearing a red captains cloak and waving his arms in the air. He stops in front of the guards and bows dramatically while shouting "Behold the captain of a horses arse, Idol of idiot worshipers!" Then he smiles and darts off into the crowd with the furious guards on his heels.<br/><br/>Gnasc smiles beneath his hood.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EMAIL 2</span>: From Gnasc's Player</b><br/><br/>Gnasc would like to stealth inside to check and make sure the coast is clear.<br/><br/>Stealth check:23<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EMAIL 3:</span> From the DM</b><br/><br/>Gnasc leans over to Celence and whispers "wait right here." and before she can respond the Rogue is gone. She searches the street but can see no sign of him. She turns her attention back to the Inn and sees the door open. A man looking a bit tipsy stumbles through the door and, wait...did she just see the Gnoll slip inside before the door slammed shut? "How does he do that?" she wonders again.<br/><br/>Gnasc slips into the Inn and sees a Tall half elf behind the front counter. The common room is empty except for a man in red robes reading a book near the fireplace. Gnasc slides past the desk and examines the top floor. The Inn has eight rooms and Gnasc detects no one inside any of them. Besides the innkeeper and the man with the red robes, the place is empty.</blockquote>\nI like this sort of thing. It's not too different than what I do at the table (interpreting what the players do to succeed/fail, but I don't really tell the players what their characters say).<br/><br/>It's a cool way to keep the pace of the game and interest in the game elevated in the quiet patches between weekly gaming events.<br/><br/>So, some questions:<br/><br/>* What do you think? Would this work for you and your group? Why or Why Not?<br/><br/>* How about the aspect where the GM tells you what your character says and does? Is that cool with you?<br/><br/>* Any way to codify it into whatever game you happen to be playing now? Specifically, in the examples that Gabe uses, it's all successes and just one failure. I imagine in normal RPGs there'd be more failure... so how do you encourage players not to cheat? Online die roller which saves the result?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241646/#Comment_241646" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T10:25:58+00:00" title="November 12, 2009 10:25AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The technique will work - technically - but I doubt it would work for long.<br/><br/>I've noticed from years of PBEM play that players start losing interest and energy after ten turns. So this micro scale approach could start falling appart after only a short time of play. Since the turn length is potentially very short that could mean the game would get through only minutes of play.<br/><br/>If everyone one was on line in a chat it might last longer because that would have some of the effect of a face to face game.<br/><br/>All this hinges on my 10 turn limit observation. Have you noticed anything like that? Reality check for me.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
