I've studied the period a bit, and I'm quite satisfied with the characters I have created. I originally planned to run this with PTA, but I'm afraid the conflict-oriented story-telling mode isn't quite right for this.  Most story-games I've played have been a bit too fast, too zany and too much about winning conflicts for my tastes, those with most GM authority have been most fun to play. I don't have a pre-planned story that the players could break, but I have a mood in mind, and I'd like to have more GM power than the PTA producer is given. I'd still like there to be some sort of mechanical encouragement for players for playing their characters in a (mostly) serious and interesting way.                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417826/#Comment_417826" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T17:09:31+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  5:09PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try FATE - the mechanical encouragement thing will be based on you getting across the seriousness of the situation in Aspects.<br/><br/>PS "Serious" con games never are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417840/#Comment_417840" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T23:34:22+00:00" title="July  5, 2013 11:34PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>PS "Serious" con games never are.</blockquote>\nI have played in two!

There are a lot of systems out there that by default limit player control to just the character in front of them, and don't have conflict-based resolution. If I had to pull a system out of thin air, I'd choose Fate (Accelerated). It's free, it's simple, and it lets you reward and compel players according to their aspects (which can easily be strong in reinforcing your tone).<br/><br/>That said, I think system and blurb are less relevant than getting the players on your side. It's important to you*, so have a nice long *conversation* with the players at the start of the session, about what you're hoping for, what they're hoping for out of the game, what you and they enjoy.  I think you'll find your players surprisingly willing to help you out if you're explicit about what you want, but if you find any obvious mismatches, then it's much better to figure out whether they should go join another game, or what compromise you can make, rather than docking them repeatedly 1 fate point for refusing your compels.<br/><br/><br/>* Tone is important to me too: I try to always make sure to have this conversation, even if it's short.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417881/#Comment_417881" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-06T15:33:52+00:00" title="July  6, 2013  3:33PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2013 3:35PM by Upstart.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for suggestions and good advice thus far, I'll check Archipelago II and Fate Accelerated out.
