                    So, I have a vision of what I want Boulevard to be about.<br/>I am just not sure how to mechanically support it, yet.<br/><br/>To quote myself from an earlier Forge post,
<blockquote>Boulevard details the lives of a bunch of barely-living-on-their-own, nihilistic, prentious, disenfranchised, fringe culture motherfuckers.<br/>We're talking about grunge kids, mohawk-toting punks, drug addicts and small-time dealers, neo-nazis, emo scene kids, and arthouse poets.<br/><br/>They all have these punky, edgy, oh-so-important causes. Like freedom of speech, feminism, sexual equality, veganism, neo-communism, etc. And they think they understand these causes.</blockquote>
That's basically it, in a nutshell. Note the eye-rolling when I say "punky, edgy, oh-so-important causes". But also note the sincerity when I list some examples of causes.<br/><br/>I want a game about kids playing at being grownups.<br/>Mere children who think that they know better than the law, and that they hold solutions the world, collectively, couldn't come up with.<br/><br/>It's also about hurting yourself. It's a game about self-destruction, and putting yourself AFTER your beliefs.<br/><br/>It's also a learning experience. I want players to know more about each other and their own beliefs, and I want them to explore a reality they most definitely don't own themselves. A part of the real world they've never (hopefully) been forced to go to.<br/><br/>It's a game about looking demons in the face and saying, "fuck you, I am stronger then you," and then realizing you aren't.<br/><br/>So, what do I want this to look like, at an around-the-table level?<br/><br/>I want the game to be played out in 2-5 sessions (an average session spanning 2-4 hours).<br/>I want there to be a lot of tension around the table.<br/><br/>Ranting will be something that is encoded into gameplay. In order to play the game, all players must themselves rant about their Character's Causes (presumably in character). This means either going off about how the world is plagued by Capitalism, or how only Anarchy can save the world, or how people are such posers, or whatever.<br/>If your character is a crazy arthouse poet, I expect you to be doing spoken word poetry kind of stuff as your "rant".<br/>If your character is a drug-addicted "street person", I would totally dig them talking as if halfway through a trip.<br/><br/>I want character environment to play some part in the game.<br/>I want to portray the cold, dirty alleyways in a gritty way, but also in a romanticized way.<br/><br/>On a mechanical level,<br/>I want players to have cap guns. Loaded for Russian Roulette (a single cap, barrel spun.)<br/>I want them to spend something to be able to fire this gun at each other, and "kill" each others hopes and dreams. (Causes).<br/>I want them to be enticed to do this because characters are always stepping on each others toes.<br/><br/>As far as ranting goes, I'm abstractly inspired by this:<br/><br/>I read this earlier:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Let me talk about the card game "Peanut Butter and Jelly."<br/><br/>There are two types of cards in the game ... some which are the components of your sandwiches (bread, peanut butter, jelly) and some which are meta-cards (flies to ruin other people's sandwiches, ants to steal ingredients).<br/><br/>You play an ingredient card, it starts a sandwich. Immediately, people are thinking "I'd rather play a meta-card than an ingredient, because I can get stuff<i>plus</i>slow down my opposition." But they're pretty much screwed, because there are way more ingredients than metas in the deck. So occasionally they get a meta, but mostly people are just playing ingredients.<br/><br/>When you complete a sandwich you remove the cards from the deck, and keep them as a stacked sandwich. Sorta like tricks in Bridge.<br/><br/>But ...<b>but</b>... when you play a meta card, it goes back in the deck.<br/><br/>So there are three phases of the game:<br/><br/>First, the ingredients are prolific, and metas are rare. Sandwiches are built. Conflict is sporadic. As more sandwiches are built we shift inevitably into ...<br/><br/>Second, the ingredients are getting scarcer, and metas are therefore more common. Sandwiches are sabotaged left and right. Conflict is rampant. As sandwiches manage to get completed (often by the most rapid, brutal sequences) we shift inevitably into ...<br/><br/>Third, the ingredients are all but depleted. The metas are now virtually useless, because there are not enough ingredients to give them power. The game slides gently to a halt.<br/><br/>Now ain't that slick? Doesn't that make you want to design a two-resource game?</blockquote>
The game is largely about What You Care About and What You Hate.<br/>And in the start there is a lot of "Care About" and not a lot of "Hate".<br/>But the "Care About" can go away, whereas the "Hate" remains.<br/>Until eventually there is more Hate than Care, and you collapse (or your faith in the Cause collapses).                </div>
