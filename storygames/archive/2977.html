The classics, of course, are the often misused GNS terms that so many folk have different ideas about as to render their very use almost meaningless.  When posed to a relative newcomer, however, they and the many other special terms we define and use can be intimidating.  We, as people who want to discuss the hobby generally, need to use fewer of these in order to lower the entry into RPG discussion and to encourage  new people to join in on these conversations.<br/><br/>My current background is in the U.S. legal system, and one of the raging issues of the past 20 years has been the way lawyers draft documents.  Lawyers tend to use specialized terms that have specific, clear legal meanings but are almost incomprehensible to lay readers.  We all understand what we mean when we use these terms and writing styles to draft contracts, licenses, and other legal documents - we're writing for each other.  Imagine, however, if we wrote this way when dealing with potential clients or spoke this way while trying to carry on a conversation with a lay person about their experiences with the law - it would be intimidating, it would make the conversation difficult, and it would be dumb.  A smart writer knows to write to the audience.<br/><br/>In much the same way the lexicon that has evolved around RPG discussion is arcane and only easily understood by other people who invest similarly large amounts of time.  Unfortunately, this leads to a barrier to entry into these discussions - few people want to dig through the terms of a contract any more than they want to look up what a "bang" is.  That many of these terms are poorly understood or carry different meanings makes it even more difficult and even presents a barrier to communication for those otherwise inclined to learn this special language.<br/><br/>We must get control of our growing lexicon if we want to continue to attract new people and continue to build useful terms within our hobby.  To that end we need to accomplish two tasks.<br/><br/>First, we must stop inventing new words for easy to understand concepts.  I know it's tempting, but it continues to increase the barrier for other people to talk with us.  Those who spend the least time immersed in theory may, in fact, have some of the most useful actual play observations to bring into these discussions.  We need that.<br/><br/>Second, we need a place to maintain a list of terms and their definitions.  A Wiki isn't going to cut it because it's too vulnerable to argument and disagreement over terms.  Rather, one of the major roleplaying sites has to step up and maintain a list.  Let us argue over the terms, but have a neutral arbiter ultimately take a working definition.  Once we have this we can promote it through use and, before we know it, we'll have a potent new tool available.  By rejecting terms that only reflect ideas easily mentioned or referred to the controller of the lexicon can prevent an excessive build up of terms.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67680/#Comment_67680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T19:44:37+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  7:44PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you.<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>Seriously, this is my biggest issue with The Forge and indie games discussion and RPG communities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67681/#Comment_67681" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T19:51:41+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  7:51PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            while it has been very rewarding for me to gain access to the established theory lexicon, i understand your point, and it's a good one.<br/>\nto comment specifically, i'd like to see this dictionary appear (i'm certainly lost in the morass of GNS and related confusion) but i'd also like to have more than one definition... i guess, different applications of terms. i know that's sort of at right angles to having a usable lexicon, but if some folks are going to use a word in a "non approved" way, then they're going to shy away from the whole dictionary, then we'll just have scattered different dictionaries.<br/>\nmaybe.<br/>\nso, have a primary definition, and related topics... something... i guess i think it can work as a moderated wiki thing, is what i'm saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nand, speaking as a relative newcomer, what i've been more interested in (and recently recieved, from M.

I've been lurking at the Forge since it was 'Punk RPGs', or whatever. I've read all of Edwards' seminal articles (several times). I've run a pretty successful <i>DitV</i> campaign, and have been designing and playtesting my own story game for about two years. But only last week, when I stumbled upon the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Model" rel="nofollow">The Big Model</a>, did I gain a semi-complete understanding of the various Forge concepts. (I think.)<br/><br/>Vocab-heavy? No doubt about it. I just wanted to voice my support for <i>anyone's</i> attempt to codify the lexicon.<br/><br/>Christopher... when you say "One of the major roleplaying sites"...

If you look at any group, you'll notice that the people within it have a special set of words or phrases that are unique to them. You see it most prominently within intellectual groups (ie: lawyers, scientists, mathematicians), but also within social groups (ie: hip-hop enthusiasts, hippies, red necks) and even within smaller, personal groups (I know my friends and I had words or phrases that had meaning only to those of us who experienced things together). I don't see the unique terms as a sign of exclusion so much as a sign of bonding. It's something that brings the people in the group closer together because they share something special - a rite-of-passage. <br/>\n<br/>\nI personally feel that even if any exclusion were to occur because of the language within a group, it's not a bad thing - it's simply weeding out the "worthy" from the "unworthy" (for lack of better terms). Take, for example, your own background in the legal system. All that crazy lingo you have to learn helps to filter out the people who don't really care about the law  from those who would do well within the legal system. If a person really cares about law, then s/he will do his/her best to learn it. Anyone who isn't interested in it will say "forget this" and move onto something else. It's the same case with any other group, including the RPG scene. I see the special lingo as really being a way for helping people to decide whether a group is really worth getting involved with or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S" title="Aaron_S"><img alt="Aaron_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/780/nLP7HPA6K2AES.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S">Aaron_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67688/#Comment_67688" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T20:33:53+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  8:33PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess it depends on how you feel about bringing 'new blood' into the RPG scene.<br/><br/>When I first got my friends together to play <i>DitV</i>, they only had experience with <i>D&amp;D 3E</i>. When I tried to explain the concept of Conflict Resolution to them, they pretty much yawned and said, "Let's get on with it -- the setting sounds cool." They didn't want to be bothered with new terminology that they didn't understand (or didn't care to, I admit). However, once we really got into play and they saw the benefits of the system, they were eager to learn more... the whys, wherefores, and others styles of play, as well.<br/><br/>My only point is this: I guess I'm just one of those optimists who thinks that there are a great many people out there who would enjoy our fascinating hobby, if only it could be rendered somewhat less... nerdy. I mean no offense with this term, as I consider myself among the proud ranks of Nerd-dom. But I see many of my friends 'coming around', when they're confronted with a relevant and <i>easy to understand</i> setting and system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67690/#Comment_67690" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T20:41:32+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  8:41PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Aaron S.</cite><br/>Vocab-heavy?

It does make some sense that if we're going to talk theory it would be nice to talk with just those people who are so heavily invested in it that they can understand and intelligently respond using the lingo.  I take issue with that in two ways, however.<br/><br/>First, over the past 6 months I've come to the shocking (for me) realization that a lot of folk who are talking theory aren't actually playing games.  The wonderful GoPlay movement that originated here and spread elsewhere seemed silly to me at first, but over time I've taken its message to be a powerful one.  I think it's tough for people who are regularly playing games, because of time constraints, to invest in learning (and staying on top of) all this lingo.  Making theory more accessible means more people will be bringing their actual play experiences into the discussions (because of the lower entry costs).  When I review games and later play them I often think to myself "Damn, my perspective on this game is really different now!" for a variety of reasons.  I've thought similar things when I've applied some theory to actual games.  This leads me to believe that drawing in more people who are regularly playing and feel able to discuss their experiences in theory terms is very valuable to all of us interested in exploring RPGs.  Keep in mind that as the entry costs continue to increase we'll just end up with fewer and fewer people able to join in.<br/><br/>Second, this benefits me as someone who does invest a lot of time in reading and participating in these conversations.  I spend a ridiculous amount of time on RPG forums and I constantly encounter terms, new and old, that I just don't understand or which I suspect the user doesn't understand.  Apologies to talysman but Laser Sharkers?  Come on, this is taking inventing new and unnecessary terms to an incredible extreme.  Trying to keep all these different terms - let alone the rampant confusion folk have over stuff like GNS - straight is time consuming and makes it more difficult to communicate with other people who share my own interests.  Even if you like the barrier of entry a concise and organized list of terms and even a hostility to new terms benefits everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67697/#Comment_67697" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T21:07:12+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  9:07PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Story Games Codex seems like it would be a good place to collect clarified depictions of our more useful theoretical constructs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut first, we might want to try to build some (reasonable) consensus on just what all these terms mean, at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone up for starting some consensus building theory threads?

My situation is pretty similar to yours: I play, run, and playtest a lot of different games, I read even more, and I spend a lot of time on a variety forums, blogs, and mailing lists; yet I keep encountering terms that either look new but cover concepts for which we had perfectly serviceable words, or words that look familiar but are used to mean something different.  <br/><br/>I suppose it would be one thing if they were used only in designer conventions and journals, but they seem to be pervasive to The Forge, Story Games, and spin-off blogs and forums.  What they end up doing is isolating the community of people who like a certain type of games \u2014 indie, small press, story games, experimental, hippie, etc. \u2014 from the rest of the gamer community.  As RPGers, we're already into a fringe hobby; I really don't think further marginalization <i>within</i> the hobby serves our best interests.<br/><br/>Ninety-percent of gamers might enjoy at least some hippie games if they encountered them in fun circumstances, but they sure won't spend their time plowing through abstruse discussions.  Maybe they would enjoy the game with Creative Agenda X, but they don't don't want to talk about creative agendas and skewers, especially if the rug is constantly pulled from under their feet by redefining terms.  Their reaction is to peg the sub-community as pretentious, lunatic, or deadly dull.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67722/#Comment_67722" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T00:08:42+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 12:08AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>if we want to continue to attract new people</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Big IF there.</p>\n<p>This certainly is the opposite of the social value of specialised language.

Truly terrible.  <br/><br/>Frankly, if the specialised terms were plainly opaque there wouldn't be such a problem, it's their similarity to existing meanings of words that causes all the issues.<br/><br/>Joshua may be fine with that, but I suspect he hasn't sat through as many rpg.net discussions as I have where the GNS guys in the thread can't agree among themselves what narrativism even means which prevents anyone ever getting to anything more interesting.  It's why away from here everyone keeps retreading GNS instead of going on to the more interesting stuff it led into, the language is obfuscatory and needlessly confusing.<br/><br/>It's just bad English, no more and no less.  The problem isn't jargon, it's bad jargon.<br/><br/>Also, frequently it's jargon for its own sake.  Using jargon where it saves time or where no existing concept serves is fair enough, but much of the jargon I see used is used where one could just as well use plain English and to better effect.<br/><br/>Like CW I'm a lawyer, we're trained these days not to use jargon even when drafting contracts wherever possible, as it impairs communication.  The point of jargon originally in part was just that, to impair communication, to prevent outsiders understanding what was going on.

It's the New Honesty!  Call them out.  I don't know any, myself. <br/><br/>I think jargon has a mimetic quality to it, and agree that sometimes unfortunate words become codified - stuff that isn't entirely clear or is actually confusing, semantically.  We probably all have our pet examples.  However, most of the jargon-y terms that can make a qualitative difference in actual play are pretty straightforward and only need to be explained once - you mention bang, and this is clearly a word that can be easily explained and implemented at the table.  That's been my experience anyway.  There's no reason on earth that anybody not interested in theory needs to parse out a more opaque term like "pervy".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67744/#Comment_67744" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T05:22:08+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  5:22AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the biggest problem with jargon happens when people coin words that can't survive contact with the outside world of RPers, not the idea of defining words for new concepts.  Bang! is just fine.  It doesn't call out a specific definition or connotation in people's minds and so when they hear it they ask what it is or go do some research.  On the other hand some terms (G/N/S I'm looking at you) sound as though you can guess their meanings between their roots and context.  And so when a small community introduces them to a much larger group they risk the original definition being effectively wiped out by people forming a new one out of the root and the context the word is being used in.  You see this in the arguments over what Narrativism is over at rpg.net for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67746/#Comment_67746" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T05:35:18+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  5:35AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 6:12AM by timfire.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a lot of mis-perceptions and revisionist-thinking going on here, probably because most of you weren't present when the "jargon" were created.<br/><br/>1) It's important to understand that much of the terminology, at the time of their creation, were never meant to be theory terms. Many terms started off as off-hand comments. No thought was given to the term, the poster just needed a word to describe their idea. Later, someone would reference that discussion, and would pull out the word. People would keep doing this, and before you knew it, the word would become "standard" terminology.<br/><br/>Really, how much thought do you think went into a term like, "The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast"? What kind of academic would make up a term like "TITBB"? Or "El Dorado" or "Typhoid Mary"?<br/><br/>2) Related to the above, most of the terminology DID start off as simple descriptions, words that the "lay person" could understand. But the ideas behind the words grew as people's understanding of play grew. <br/><br/>GNS-Sim is a perfect example of this. At one time, it really did have the connotation of "simulation-play". If you read the original essay "System Does Matter", Sim is defined as the "player is satisfied if the system 'creates' a little pocket universe without fudging" and "include[s] the well-known subtype of the Realist." But as people's understanding of Sim grew, it morphed into the idea of "the Right to Dream".<br/><br/>3) Early theory discussions used many more "general" and commonly-used terms. But it became apparent through time that different people had different ideas about what the terms meant. In other words, these "commonly understood terms" actually weren't commonly understood.<br/><br/>Railroading is a good example. Railroading means different things to different people. So the ideas of GM-Force, Illusionism, and Participationism all grew out of a need to differentiate what people meant when they said "railroading". <br/><br/>This last reason is a big one. Back in the heyday of the Forge Theory/GNS boards, people would sometimes talk for like 4-5 pages before they realized they were talking about different things using the same words. It's simply impossible to have on-going, in-depth discussion <i>about any topic</i> without specialized terminology. It's a very practical issue.<br/><br/><i>Edited for grammar.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67750/#Comment_67750" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T05:48:33+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  5:48AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll point to what Tim just posted and say, "What he said."<br/><br/>In addition, the terminology and jargon isn't there for me (or anyone) to have conversations about RPG's with just anyone.  It's there to serve as common terms for game designers and people who are very interested in deep discussions on RPG Theory.  Thus the "lay person" as someone termed them above isn't the target audience for such language and why should I want them to be?  I've got extensive training in Computer Science and Software Design and I have a whole host of jargon terms that have very specific meanings when I'm discussing that discipline with other software designers.  I really don't care that the jargon offers a barrier of entry to the average computer user who is listening to those discussions, even if they want to participate.  If I'm talking to the average computer user then I drop the jargon, even though it makes me have to explain certain concepts in a longer, more round-a-bout way.<br/><br/>I don't know.

Because you are talking about me and my friends, I would like specific people to be named, so that they can defend themselves and explain their situations.  I'd also like some evidence pointing to that anyone believes that anything is "the only way to talk about RPGs."<br/><br/>The only people I'd ever heard say that there is only one way to talk about RPGs are theory naysayers, like you, saying that RPGs must be discussed using only traditional terms ("rail-roading," "role-playing versus roll-playing," and such.)  I think you're wrong about that (I think having lots of ways to discuss something is a nearly universal positive) but if that wrongness makes you happy, that's cool with me.<br/><br/>What isn't cool with me is slander about how I "never play" and "have forgotten what RPGs are."  I play three regularly meeting games plus pick-up games once or twice a week.  I've personally spent a large chunk of this year bringing new people to RPGs.  Oh, yeah, and I invest a lot of personal time and energy in writing and promoting them generally.<br/><br/>So I'm smarting a little at the "theorists never play" and such stuff.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67760/#Comment_67760" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T06:39:13+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  6:39AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 6:50AM by Andy.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Why should I care about altering my language that's intended for game designers and those interested in game design so that those who don't care about game design can understand it?</blockquote>\nWhile I totally agree with you to a point... The Forge of 3 years ago was for to-be game designers, by to-be game designers, for the purpose of designing games. I have no problem with the stratifying nature of the dialog and vocabulary.  As indicated in the first post, it's just the "technical talk" of the field.<br/><br/>However, in the past three years, the Forge has focused a lot on Actual Play and "fixing problems with your games", and even on other sites the above "technical" terms have been (mis)used to apply to the act of gaming.<br/><br/>For the "game design technical lingo" field, I feel like there shouldn't be any particular focus on accessibility (well, I say that, and yet still would LOVE to see a lot of the terms cleaned up, redefined, etc.  However, that last sentence is "how I feel"). <br/><br/>For the "stuff that can be applied to talk about gamers gaming, at Story-Games, RPGnet, Wherever...", I feel exactly as C.W. feels. It needs to be reinvented, re-"marketed" (in terms of using words that Make Sense at a Glance), etc.<br/><br/>More than a few years ago, it's probably time to sit down and say:<br/>"This pool of words over here is for Forge game design speech. Let's fix them up a little, clarify them, perhaps even rename them so that potential designers don't have to be familiar with a canon of threads like they were doing academic research just to talk about game design."<br/><br/>"That pool of words over there can be used to talk about gaming outside of game design. Let's totally rebuild them from the ground up, including renaming them as we need, so that they make sense to passersby, instead of simply confusing them."<br/><br/>-Andy\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>So I'm smarting a little at the "theorists never play" and such stuff.</blockquote>\nEdit: This is a secondary point, but yeah, "What Ben Said".  I've got:<br/>1) A weekly game on Thursdays, where we pretty much run and play more traditional games with me usually GMing (D&amp;D, Star Wars, GURPS, etc).<br/>2) A bi-weekly game that mixes it up, where we play all sorts of stuff, and the GM switches a lot.<br/>3) Outside of that, 1-2 pick-up games or ongoing mini-campaigns that happen on the weekends.<br/>4) Plus going to regular EnWorld meetups, bringing new folks into gaming (with D&amp;D!), etc.<br/><br/>So yeah, even in the theory hayday, when people were spending more time arguing over GNS in the RPG Theory forum at the Forge than helping people design their games in the Game Design forum, I could still point at those "heavy talkers" and say "He plays weekly. She plays bi-weekly. That guy plays 2 times a week. That guy over there plays monthly", etc.<br/><br/>As an aside, the only person properly removed from Story-Games ('banned') was removed because he was arguing passionately here and on other sites, screaming about how important X was in play, or how Y sucked in play... later it came out that that person hadn't gamed in several years, and even then didn't find it all that enjoyable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67762/#Comment_67762" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T06:44:46+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  6:44AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>Amen to that.

Then people start talking about that and we find by the time we're ten posts in we have nine different definitions of narrativism and that the original poster meant something entirely different to what most people here would take it as meaning.<br/><br/>It's a pain, it makes discussions of theory much harder work than they need to be.  I'm not saying there shouldn't be jargon, I am saying that I think the jargon that exists is poor jargon and that there is a tendency sometimes to use it where it's wholly unnecessary.<br/><br/>For example, that recent thread about making great sim?  That was actually a request for specific play techniques for a Hero game, using GNS terms did not make for a clearer discussion there.  There wasn't even a GNS issue as best I could tell.<br/><br/>And to all this someone will doubtless say, should I change how I speak because someone else might misuse the terms?  To which my answer is, that depends on whether you care about the broader community and have any interest in talking to it.  If not, then not I guess.  <br/><br/>There's good jargon and bad jargon.  Stances for example, pawn stance, actor stance, author stance, that's not bad and it's fairly obvious something specific is meant.  When there's confusion in a thread about what actor stance means I usually see it get cleared up quickly, I don't see as I do with say simulationism the whole thread disappear into a terminological debate.<br/><br/>That's because actor stance is a useful piece of jargon, while simulationism is deeply counterintuitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67765/#Comment_67765" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T06:52:30+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  6:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 6:53AM by Andy.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite><br/>There's good jargon and bad jargon...<br/>That's because actor stance is a useful piece of jargon, while simulationism is deeply counterintuitive.</blockquote>'<br/><br/>Very much agree here, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67768/#Comment_67768" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T06:59:03+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  6:59AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 7:26AM by D-503.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite><br/>There's good jargon and bad jargon...<br/>That's because actor stance is a useful piece of jargon, while simulationism is deeply counterintuitive.</blockquote>'<br/><br/>Very much agree here, too.<br/><br/>The trouble is, people outside this community hear theory and they think GNS, whereas actually there's lots more than that.<br/><br/>I mean, all that stuff about fortune, karma and one I forget, that's theory too and it has sod all to do with GNS*.

But it's also questionable whether changing the terms would actually help. I actually much prefer "thematic-play" over "narrativism". Thematic-play is certainly clearer, but is Joe-Q going to understand what it means? Many people don't understand what the idea of "theme" means, as evident by many threads at the Forge and elsewhere. When they do, they don't always understand the distinction between creating theme in play versus pre-defining theme (as is often utilized in Gam &amp; Sim).<br/><br/>The real issue, as I see it, isn't the terminology <i>per se</i>. It's that people don't understand the concepts behind the terms. This gets back to what Ben was saying. Terms are usually used as a reference for previous discussions or complex concepts. You have to have access to those discussions to "get" the term. This is an inherent issue whenever you're discussing complex concepts.

(Assuming that designers do need the jargon.)<br/><br/>I've been on the periphery of the Forge Folk for 2-3 years now, and I play Forgey games pretty much exclusively (though I don't play as often as I like).  I have pretty much zero knowledge of the Forge Language, and this ignorance hasn't prevented me from enjoying the games or getting along with other players.  Forge Language is for working out kinks in design; I don't design, so I don't need to learn the language.  I'm having a great time.<br/><br/>I can understand a designer needing to know what the Forge Language means, if the designer wants the Forge's help in building a game.  <br/><br/>I can understand someone who is really serious about understanding what role-playing <i>is</i>, taking an interest in Forge Language because it's helpful to understand the design decisions leading to some very unconventional modes of play.<br/><br/>But if you're not really serious about either of those topics--like, professionally serious--where's the problem?  <br/><br/>What I see on RPG.Net -- it used to be about once a week, now it's far less frequent thanks to Levi, praise God -- is 30 different people playing status games about their mastery of, or disdain for, Forge Language.  Nobody needed to know what the terms meant: it could have been anything, the terms were simply a football to kick around.   If it hadn't been Forge Language, it would have been something else.  The only people who truly wanted to know what the terms meant were poor souls who wandered into the thread out of curiosity and good faith. <br/><br/>Those threads were complete gibberish because (a) almost nobody understood what the terms meant, (b) no one had sufficient authority to set people straight, and (c) even if people understood or had the authority, it's the Internet and nobody would listen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67780/#Comment_67780" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T07:27:40+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  7:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>For example, that recent thread about making great sim?

The problem is with people who use the terminology without bothering to understand it, or, as James points out, as a football to kick around.<br/><br/>I'm in a thread over on the Hero boards that's been going on for fourteen pages with people wildly misusing GNS terminology. Most are making the typical mistake of thinking the term itself is all they need to know. "Narrativism... that's obviously people who like narrative, right?" I stepped in to post links to the Forge Provisional Glossary, RandomWIki, Ben's site, and Vincent's "Roleplaying Theory, Hardcore." The response I got was stuff like, "That's all well and good, but these formalized definitions don't match the common usage." Which is, of course, bullshit.<br/><br/>Forge terminology is, surprise, the Forge's terminology. You don't need it to talk about play. Even Ron advises avoiding it when posting Actual Play threads. If you don't buy into the Big Model, don't want to talk about design from a Forge perspective, or don't want to make an effort to understand their lingo, <i>don't use it</i>.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, sources like those I mention above already serve as the reference Chris is looking for.

If I can't encounter a discussion in the moment and figure out where the value is within about five minutes or less, it's going to pass out of my available window of time to look at and think about the thing.<br/><br/>It's as simple as that.  It feels like there's an assertion running around that theory doesn't have to be accessible to non-designers because it's meant for designers.  As a designer, I can tell you the jargonism in theory is exactly why I don't engage in it.  At least in my specific case, that seems to fly right in the face of the assertion I'm talking about here.<br/><br/>It feels like jargon is the dividing barrier between theory and what I call practical design principles.  Some of you probably see theory and pragmatic design as one and the same; I'm betting you have less of a problem with jargon comprehension than I do.  But for me, they're night and day.  When someone says "your game should support such-and-such a principle from GNS theory", they have not taken me any closer to understanding what they say.  When my buddy Rob says to me, "i want you to take the narration parts of your game out of the game for a moment and look at the dice game you've got, and make sure that that's interesting independent of the roleplaying part", he has given me a practical design principle, couched in natural, clear language, and I understand what he's getting at right away.  The latter helped me make Don't Rest Your Head a better game.  The former is pretty much crap, and always will be, where I'm concerned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67808/#Comment_67808" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T08:14:32+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  8:14AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Can I ask a (possibly offensive) question?<br/><br/>Why does anyone, other than a game designer,<i>need</i>to know what the jargon means?

I'm certainly not new to theory but I still find it difficult and time consuming to understand what people say sometimes.

The first thing Ron did was to tell me to drop the GNS talk and just write about our play in plain language. It worked and the thread was extremely helpful to me. I didn't feel like there was any barrier to entry at all.

By explaining inline at at-the-time what you mean when you choose to use jargon, you're showing that you have a genuine willingness to explain and are cleverly heading off misunderstandings at the pass, striking an up=front blow for clarity rather than obfuscation.  Using jargon without at-the-time explanation is a pretty solid way to make sure that someone will come in and misunderstand what you meant when you started using the term.<br/><br/>c) ... because there is nothing, nothing at all more infuriating and more useless than being told "go read this multi-paragraph essay and come back once you've done so [thus gaining admission to our exclusive country club]" in order to participate in a conversation you should by all rights be able to participate in, if only someone had bothered to explain their use of terms in a clear, concise way at the get-go.<br/><br/>Edit: In the end, I suppose a lot of this comes from my position that you shouldn't expect to have useful discussions about theory if you're unwilling to teach that theory in a way that doesn't have a high cost of entry (time investment) for the reader.  You're choosing to use specialized terms; if you're genuinely interested in including someone from outside of your tiny ivory tower, the burden of using that theory in a discussion should be on you, not on the people outside.

(Assuming that designers do need the jargon.)</blockquote>\nI don't design games (though it's becoming harder and harder to resist the urge to do so), but I do have a deep interest in game design. I'm like that with any hobby; when I'm interested in something, I want to tear it apart and see how it works. I want to know what went into making it. <br/><br/>You don't need to be a game designer to be interested in game design, to want to talk about game design, or to have your appreciation of games enhanced by your understanding of game design. Just like you don't need to be a musician to have your enjoyment of music enhanced by your understanding of music theory. I wrote a lot of music when I was younger; these days, I might pick up the guitar and noodle around once in awhile, but that's about it. However, my knowledge of music theory allows me to <i>listen</i> to music more critically and to identify <i>why</i> I like the music I like. <br/><br/>And more importantly, in my opinion, my ability to listen to music critically allows me to talk to other people about music, help <i>them</i> figure out what they like and why, and suggest other artists or styles that they might also enjoy. I'd like to be able to do that with roleplaying games, too, but I simply lack the theoretical understanding to do so.<br/><br/>So, why would a non-designer need to know what the jargon means? Because <i>not</i> knowing the jargon is a barrier to understanding theory, and understanding theory is useful to more than just designers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67859/#Comment_67859" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T09:49:43+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  9:49AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 9:50AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For whatever zenlike effect it might have, I note that this is at least the fifth time that I'm aware of that thoughtful discussions on this exact subject have emerged. I'm sure there are more, but this emerges perennially on fora to which I attend.<br/>\n<br/>\nLot's of possible interpretations of that. But one sure conclusion I can draw. Nothing said so far in any of these threads has, apparently, had any real effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I am still claimed to be doing it OK (but I always feel like there are eyes on my back).<br/>\n- Jack Spencer is still they guy who always theorized without playing.<br/>\n- Fred still feels alienated.<br/>\n- The sun will rise tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, for a lexicon, I suggest that people look at the theory entries on Doyce's wiki: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://random.average-bear.com/TheoryTopics/HomePage" rel="nofollow">http://random.average-bear.com/TheoryTopics/HomePage</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHardly perfect, but being a Wiki, if you have an improvement, you can make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one more thing. Yes, the theory is theoretically useful for anyone playing RPGs. In practice, because of the barrier to entry that does exist, it's useful in that manner for relatively few. Some people will consider that a big problem, others not. While it's always been thought to be useful this way, it's never been a goal of the theory to be as widely understood as possible.

But I'm not that interested in the topic, so I'll restrain myself to two quick points and one correction.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I'm completely against "barriers to entry", but recognize that there's a natural learning curve to anything, even conversing about a particular game theory.</li>\n<li>I agree with Fred that the practice of referring back to multiple long discussions when asked "what do you mean by X?" has got to stop.</li>\n<li>(the correction): Simulationism originally meant exactly what it seems to mean, but people's understanding of it evolved... and people are in disagreement about what it really means. There seems to be common agreement on the "I know it when I see it" level, but not much agreement about what makes Simulationism distinct. On the Forge, Jay had a distinct definition antithetical to just about everyone else's (I forget what his handle was... Calithenia? Something like that.) I define Sim as any game where the fiction is more important than interactions between people around the table, but this is not a popular definition, either. Combine that with the discovery that not all forms of play that seem to be Sim are modeling reality or simulating a fantasy world in the strict sense and you have a breakdown. The term no longer means what it meant when it was coined, but everyone's intentions <em>when the term was coined</em> were honorable. They were trying to be clear and jargon-free.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Simulationism isn't the only term that started out with a clear meaning borrowed from popular usage and evolved into more opaque jargon. For example, Push and Pull seemed very intuitive at the beginning, but as the discussion continued, the terms evolved. I avoid using them, myself, because I think they have become highly specialized terms. The new meanings are not as obvious to me as the old ones. Even the term "GNS" has become more opaque, in the sense that everyone uses it incorrectly to talk about "the three Creative Agendas"... except that there are now <em>four</em> Creative Agendas.</p>\n<p>It's good to be as clear as possible when creating jargon, but language evolves, and words can become less clear over time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67901/#Comment_67901" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T11:30:32+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 11:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.

We were talking about the state of RPG theory.  And Chris was bringing up a comparison to early (say, late medieval, early renaissance) music theory, since he's been reading a lot about music semiotics.<br/><br/>So then I go, "Yeah, in RPG theory, we haven't even gotten to Bach yet."  <br/><br/>And Chris was like, "Yeah, think of all the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrigal_%28music%29" rel="nofollow">madrigals</a> that were written.  Great stuff and important for what later developed, but it was all rendered much less important by things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint" rel="nofollow">counterpoint</a>."<br/><br/>So consider that:  when the revolution comes, or as RPG theory gradually evolves into a more advanced body of thought, the old jargon will be some of the first things up against the wall as new and better terminology moves into to replace it. Until then, you can't force terminology changes by telling everyone they should speak differently.  People will talk differently when they have new terms that they think are better, which only happens if people try to promote new ways of thinking about games.  <br/><br/>So, yeah, I'm all for you getting a bunch of RPGnet people together to talk about new terminology.  If your new jargon is any good, some people will start using it, and that represents something.  What that represents, well, we'll have to wait and see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67946/#Comment_67946" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T12:11:57+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 12:11PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 12:17PM by Kynn.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>Let me give you context: I'm an RPG theorist and designer.

You're seeing attacks on "ME and my FRIENDS" left and right. You're setting up strawmen repeatedly and not, apparently, responding to anything I've said.

My point remains that the culture around RPG theory is exclusive and exclusionary, and the jargon problem is a symptom of that.

If you're going to use jargon, please consider <br/>- defining it up front rather than making it something people have to dig for<br/>- defining it in the place where you use it rather than making it something people have to dig for<br/>- using it with an attitude of "since i am using specialized language but want to include others who don't speak it, i assume the obligation to teach"<br/><br/>As someone inside the theory bubble, Ben's suggestions have oriented on:<br/><br/>... if you encounter jargon you don't understand, please<br/>- ask for definitions<br/><br/>I think these two positions are good ones, though I retain a bit of a bias towards my own as a path to better resolution, because Ben's suggestions are more for the people who behold something incomprehensible and are willing to get over the cognitive hurdles necessary to want to ask, to feel able to ask.  I am proposing, instead, methods and practices which I believe will make it instead, something comprehensible.  In being comprehensible, it will be approachable.  In being approachable, those who are feeling shut out, but who might have something to contribute, will -- with your helping hand up -- be more willing and able to surmount those hurdles keeping them from engaging with the discussion and asking questions.  Without that helping hand, they simply *are* shut out.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kynn is channelling Ragezor, the Avatar of My Unspoken Emotional Response (aka, that which I once was and am trying not to be again).  I'm not sure it's helping the conversation, even if he's essentially trying to deploy it on 'my' side. Kynn -- I agree with and feel much of your pain, but right now, I think you're actually harming your side of the conversation -- the one where I'm standing.  Help me stand on some more stable ground, here?<br/><br/>But to grab at Kynn's example of the Lasersharking thread...<br/><br/>- "Lasersharking" is used in the subject line of the thread.<br/>- It is used thoroughly and conversationally in the first post, without any real definition of what it means<br/>- The term sounded intriguing, but when I first clicked through and looked at that thread, early in its inception, I saw nothing to help me understand the term, and so it immediately got labelled "jargon; not worth my time"<br/>- It isn't until the SEVENTH post, AFTER C.W. (who I think is probably among the best in terms of being willing to engage and ask when someone uses opaque language) asks for a clarification.<br/>- At this point, the clarification has come about well after the point where my initial evaluation period for the value of the thread has passed.<br/><br/>In the end, I have the reaction of "seriously, how hard would it have been to define opaque jargon terminology in the original post?  and wouldn't that have made the thread more accessible to folks like me?"<br/><br/>I am left feeling that folks are getting up on mountains and then shaking their heads thinking, "Why is Fred down at the bottom, where I've left him without any climbing gear?  He must not be up to the task."<br/><br/>And I think that's where the Avatar of Ragezor stuff is coming from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67977/#Comment_67977" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T12:41:56+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 12:41PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Carlo --<br/><br/>How about offering to take you by the hand and walk you step-by-step through the definitions of everything?<br/><br/>Because I make that offer, repeatedly, and no one ever seems to take me up on it.<br/><br/>If anyone does, for any given term, please contact me by whispering yr e-mail in this thread and we'll find a forum to do it on.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67982/#Comment_67982" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T12:43:55+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 12:43PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 12:48PM by talysman.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Maybe people should calm down.</p>\n<p>Speaking as the example Kynn used, I am not offended, because it's an important point. True, lasersharking is gamer slang rather than theory jargon, but it's opaque language, which is the point of the thread. Should I have used the term without defining it? Since other people here have used the term, I figured I'd be understood... but on the other hand, there's been more people coming to Story Games lately, and I knew that.</p>\n<p>It's hard to judge which terms are going to need explaining and which don't. We all use a now-standard dice notation (4d6+3), but there are new gamers all the time, so some people are bound to not know what that means. The key is for people using a term to explain it when someone asks, and for someone to ask when they don't understand. There has to be some give-and-take, or no one is going to get anywhere.</p>\n<p>We're not going to be able to create a perfect language, because language doesn't work that way. Most of it is analogy, metaphor, and simile, anyways. Lasershark is a reference to something in an Austin Powers movie. When I was asked to explain it, I referred to it as "piling awesome on top of awesome to make some Frankenstein setting or character." But there's another metaphor, plus an allusion to Frankenstein. And neither of those were even standard gamer slang. It's possible I still would not be understood, in which case someone could ask what I meant, and I would have to find a better way to explain.</p>\n<p>Because that's what a conversation is. Explaining ourselves to each other.</p>\n<p>So, newbies: if you don't understand what someone says, ask. Veterans: if someone asks you what something means, <em>explain</em>. Don't get defensive, or demand that someone go off and study X pages of documents. Just keep the conversation going back and forth. And think about your audience beforehand, to prevent misunderstandings before they happen. The burden falls mostly on the person speaking or writing, not the person listening or reading.</p>\n<p>[<strong>EDIT</strong>: crossposted with Fred, but we're basically saying the same thing.]</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67983/#Comment_67983" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T12:45:09+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 12:45PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>Please read the thread.

That was me telling you that you can complain until you're blue in the face and nothing is going to change. It didn't change when someone made this exact same thread months ago. It won't change when someone makes this exact same thread months from now. It is the way it is.<br/><br/>Like it or not, fair or not, that's the way it is. If you ask someone about a term and someone sends you a link to a 4 page thread, they've done it because the context is important. And that's almost always going to be the case because the complaints didn't stop when the Forge Glossary, with it's short explanations, went online years ago. And unfortunately, without the context, people have a tendency to take the short explanations and misinterpret them.<br/><br/>There's no Forge Theory 101 class. That's also the way it is. Unless someone is willing to sit down and do it, that's not going to change. And unless you say that you're the one that's going to do it, I wouldn't hold your breath. It's too much work and someone is just going to call you an asshole afterward anyway.<br/><br/>Given all that, your only real choice, if you want to understand the esoterica, is to participate and ask questions when you don't understand something.

I've explicitly stated that I like both Story Games and the Forge. They've both been extremely helpful. But I find your attitude shitty. In your post you basically said: ''If you don't understand a term, I will tell you to go find the 25 page thread and read it. Tough luck. If you want to try and make it easier for the newbies, you're going to fail. Good luck.''<br/>What part of that is helpful?</blockquote>\nDude, this is not my attitude. That was me telling you that you can complain until you're blue in the face and nothing is going to change. It didn't change when someone made this exact same thread months ago. It won't change when someone makes this exact same thread months from now. It is the way it is.<br/><br/>Like it or not, fair or not, that's the way it is. If you ask someone about a term and someone sends you a link to a 4 page thread, they've done it because the context is important. And that's almost always going to be the case because the complaints didn't stop when the Forge Glossary, with it's short explanations, went online years ago. And unfortunately, without the context, people have a tendency to take the short explanations and misinterpret them.<br/><br/>There's no Forge Theory 101 class. That's also the way it is. Unless someone is willing to sit down and do it, that's not going to change. And unless you say that you're the one that's going to do it, I wouldn't hold your breath. It's too much work and someone is just going to call you an asshole afterward anyway.<br/><br/>Given all that, your only real choice, if you want to understand the esoterica, is to participate and ask questions when you don't understand something. Without yelling or making nasty generalizations.<br/><br/>Well I'll agree with that.

Basically, show me a thread where someone WON'T "step down from their pedestal." That one wasn't one of those, because (at the time I posted), no one was asking for clarity and everyone seemed to be getting along smashingly.<br/><br/>We do want inclusion. I didn't think that thread was excluding anyone -- certainly not intentionally! Inclusion, in my mind, requires people to meet in the middle. Yeah, that thread would be made more inclusive if talysman had defined what he meant up front. I wasn't debating that. If you're making a point that we need to be proactive about jargon, okay, that's a different matter and I don't think anyone is saying otherwise. Are we?<br/><br/>We do want criticism. That doesn't mean that we don't look at criticism of ourselves with a critical eye and ask questions and point out inconsistencies of thought.  I don't think you made the point you were trying to make in that post, so I criticized you.  Do you want criticism? You went all-caps on me, so I'm thinking you're shutting down and not listening.<br/><br/>We do want examples. The thing you pointed at?  I don't think it was an example of what you said you were trying to demonstrate. I'm not saying that there aren't examples out there that show people being particularly assholish with jargon, redirection questions to articles, and so on. In fact, I'll bet I've done it in the past (and I'm not proud of it). But if you're going to point to examples, make sure your example demonstrates your point. That one didn't. It may have demonstrated some other point that was in your head and not in your post. Cool. We can talk about that other point separately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68031/#Comment_68031" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T13:38:08+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  1:38PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's some of what I hope is useful advice that might actually change things. Call me an optimist, idealist, or fool. Your pick.<br/><br/>If you're posting on RPG.net, don't pull out all the jargon. RPG.net has a broad membership, many of whom may have never heard of GNS or the Forge. Talk in plain terms. Use extra words to explain what you mean. Use some examples from actual play to demonstrate things where you might usually toss out a jargon term. <br/><br/>If you're posting on the Forge, use jargon with care. A lot of the active folks there can spot nuanced problems with jargon use and will often correct people. I think that's the right place for that kind of jargon discussion. That said, if you're one of the people doing correction, please be gentle.  We do want to be inclusive. That means not driving away smart people who just don't know our funky moon language. The best thing to do? Clear the table of jargon altogether. Say, "Eh, let's both agree not to jump into the jargon right now. Let's talk about your game. We can use regular words here. Once we're clear on the actual subject matter, then we can talk about how the jargon maps to it."  In general, most posters aren't there to talk about jargon (and when they are, they're usually pretty clear about it).  Most posters are there to solve a game design problem, diagnose why their Champions or Sorcerer game blew up, or something like that. <br/><br/>A lot of people enter those discussions using the jargon because they are trying to speed up the conversation but they misuse it. That just creates more confusion. I think people who lurk on the Forge for a while see those jargony conversations and post one of their own AP reports or whatever and start throwing G and N and S around in weird ways and then the discussion focuses on the misuse of the terms instead of the real problem, which is that Bob wanted to play Champions and Mary wanted to play Sorcerer and both of them got all passive-aggressive on the GM, who showed up with D&amp;D 3E.<br/><br/>If you're calling for more transparency on the jargon, realize that no single person owns it. Hit Doyce's wiki and improve what's there. If you want to improve people's understanding of the jargon -- especially your own -- then building up the jargon wiki is a great thing for you and everyone else. Teaching is learning. If you don't care about (anyone) improving it, then I assume your stake in this discussion is to get people to stop using it entirely. That's not a transparency issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68033/#Comment_68033" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T13:42:03+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  1:42PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 1:48PM by jackson_tegu.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i should've kept notes for what i wanted to add to this thread.<br/>\nhere goes nothing:<br/>\n<br/>\na) i'm real new to story games, and relatively new to the forge. three seasons, as the world has them. when starting out, i was stoked to "be in the know" about theory jargon in general, i wanted to be a member of what i saw then not as a club, but as group of folks who've developed language to reffer to concepts which did not yet have words. this was very exciting to me.<br/>\ni have grow to understand that it is not as unified as i origionally thought, and that is very good - more work is being done. i have had moments of dissapointment as i try to reconcile different definitions and ideas and realize that they're either not part of the same school of thought (which is fine), or that they're different revisions of a single school... or maybe not school so much as theory. to "get" a concept is great, but then to realize it's no longer as widely accepted, that something new has been established... it can be frustrating. <br/>\ni understand the value to study what has come before - i just also want to know that it's "what has come before", and that more recent stuff is available.<br/>\n<br/>\nto this end...<br/>\nb) M.

Or, where else can i find Ben's articles?<br/>\ni will start a new thread to ask for links to introductory (and intermediate, too, please) theory articles.<br/>\n<br/>\nc) george, i couldn't tell if your request about "zen" was ironic or not. at this website, the moderator asks everyone to play nicely together, and not flame war or anything. instead of listing rules to abide by, he asks we use our common sense as to what would be reaching too far towards offensive behaviour. offensive behaviour would upset the "mood", perhaps the "atmosphere" that the moderator intended and the users create. the moderator uses this as a general guide to police the users, and enforce the good will.<br/>\nthis was not intended as anything other than information. my careful wording is not meant to inferr that you did or did not know these concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\nd) gosh, folks, slow down. reading this one thread has eaten up all my available time, and now i leave unsatisfied, having fewer opinions on jargon's import and more angry and upset back-and-forth-ing logged dutifuly in my head. i know your concern is not how much of this thread or others i personally get to read, but... well, reading threads on fora dosen't seem a really great way to learn Anything, let alone challenging concepts.<br/>\nthis last is an opinion, and was only said in the bid to get folks to write things with the intent of having others, perhaps years later, read their posts trying to get at the heart of an issue which is being discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\ne) thanks for the tip about the mouse-overs to get folks' names, ben.<br/>\n<br/>\nf)thor, i think that people can get together and make things happen. our opinions differ, you just sounded really sure of yourself so i thought that a counter opinion could also be heard. though the internet is generally a shitty way to get things done (literally? um...) i think that interested parties could gather work together, re-work things... i mean, it's already happening. blah. you know what i am trying to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: i remembered something else - i've not wanted to ask for clarity on terms or issues, for two reasons: 1) i've not wanted to be annoying. i'm glad that my future queries will be met gracefully, i feel re-assured of that now. 2) there are lots of different definitions floating around out there. i've not wanted to hijack threads by asking a GNS (for example) clarity question, then have eight people fight with one another about that topic, and ignore the origional thread starter's topic. this is a fear of mine that this would happen, it has never actually happened to me. ...and, i think a good answer to this in future would simply to start a new thread. <br/>\nagain, thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68034/#Comment_68034" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T13:45:28+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  1:45PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>i<br/><br/>c) george, i couldn't tell if your request about "zen" was ironic or not. at this website, the moderator asks everyone to play nicely together, and not flame war or anything. instead of listing rules to abide by, he asks we use our common sense as to what would be reaching too far towards offensive behaviour. offensive behaviour would upset the "mood", perhaps the "atmosphere" that the moderator intended and the users create. the moderator uses this as a general guide to police the users, and enforce the good will.<br/>this was not intended as anything other than information. my careful wording is not meant to inferr that you did or did not know these concepts.<br/></blockquote>\nNo, it was an actual question, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/binarysins" title="binarysins"><img alt="binarysins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/binarysins">binarysins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68049/#Comment_68049" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T14:05:24+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  2:05PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I'm probably 100 posts too late.

I mean, as capital-T 'theory' goes, this stuff is not generally complex, but to me that just explains why I only have to read a 25 page article instead of a 250 page book to get a handle on it. We're talking about stuff that is only a few years old, and some of it is actively in development... the expectations around what kind of transparency and clarity the community should be achieving at this point are, to me, over the top.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that people shouldn't be willing to try and summarize things, or offer abstracts along with their links, or do their best to explain things clearly.

Because, well, I'm an insider.  I've been on the Forge for years.  Before the Forge forums even existed, I wrote documents about group contract, simulationism, gamism, narrative stances, and so forth.  I've followed pretty well most of the theory discussion, maintain an extensive page of theory topics, and I believe I know it as well as anyone.  <br/><br/>Nevertheless, despite being an insider, I believe that there is a problem in the approach here.  First of all, I do not agree that most of the terms are well agreed-upon.  But setting that aside, I have no problem with a private list or forum for discussion say among only Forge theory experts.  However, if you want to talk in a public forum with a variety of people, then yes, I think you should cut back on your jargon and for the few terms you do use, give definitive, clear sources for what you're referring to.  \n<blockquote>Neither is necessarily correct, but the flipside of your admonition, John, is that for an "outsider" to bust into a conversation demanding that an expert coded language be adjusted for them is hubris. Just as it would be for a novice to interrupt two physics professors discussing String Theory to demand that they use language he understands. No matter how much players of RPGs insist that analysis thereof is trivial, the group of game designers who use that coded language consider an understanding of the "jargon" and the thought behind it to be a prerequisite to holding meaningful conversation about game design. Unlike most professional physicists, however, they're by-and-large willing to explain the coded language for free.</blockquote>\nOK, this bugs me quite a bit, because I was a physicist and I was also involved in physics education.  If you want to actually communicate to people outside of your narrow set, then yes, you should use language that they understand.  Too many high-energy physicists were dismissive of outreach and didn't even try to explain to the public about what they were studying -- and then they raged and complained when funding for the Superconducting Super-Collider was cut.  To me, that was hubris -- the expectation that the public would continue to respect and fund them when they couldn't be bothered to communicate to them the importance of their work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68176/#Comment_68176" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T21:40:01+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  9:40PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 9:41PM by Alex.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>Darn right. Why, if they explained it using straightforward language, the layperson might rightfully conclude that string theory is complete nonsense, and the jargon is simply serving to obscure the lack of actual information.

That would certainly be a dreadful situation.<br/><br/>I wonder if there are any parallels.</blockquote>The Forge produces games. In the world of design, games are like experiments. The biggest criticism of string theory is that you can never really test it, which would make it wanky math rather than actual physics (I don't know enough quantum/particle stuff to really say whether you <i>can</i> test string theory's claims or not, but the falsifiability problem is the one I keep hearing about). The Big Model isn't a scientific theory, but it does offer some testable hypothesis. In particular, the statement "Forge theory is a useful tool for designing good games" is at least partially falsifiable: you can look at the games that Forge folks create and evaluate those. That won't prove that theory made the game good, but, if enough game designers saying "Yeah, I think theory was important to my design," it's probably doing something.<br/><br/>Also, and this is quite important: I'm pretty sure you can still get self-publishing help on the Forge even if you don't know or don't buy into the theory stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68179/#Comment_68179" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T21:56:25+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  9:56PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor Olavsrud</cite>There's no Forge Theory 101 class.

Other than cases where there is a nomenclature body that certifies them (and even then, you'll still see usage that defies the nomenclature: try industrial chemistry sometime), terms happen just like they happen in this community. Somebody makes up a label for "this thing I'm looking at", and it either gets adopted, gets modified, or gets lost in the shuffle. Why "quark"? Somebody made it up. It stuck. Sciences with low barriers to entry (Computer science since the 80s, engineering practically always, the natural sciences up until around 1950 or so) are particularly prone to opaque, in-jokey terms (see "bug" in computing, "Sexy Son hypothesis" in biology, "fullerene" in chemistry...)<br/><br/>The process of publication, refereeing, and collaboration refines terms over time. We don't really have much that's equivalent to that, but the closest we DO have is discussions on message boards and mailing lists and blogs. The thing is - those have close to zero barriers to entry - everybody feels like they're an expert. So the refinement process gets drowned in noise. "Agreed upon terms" just don't happen without some kind of institutionalized process of review - which is inevitably exclusionary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Iskander" title="Iskander"><img alt="Iskander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.ajnewman.net/i/eye.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Iskander">Iskander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68236/#Comment_68236" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T07:30:53+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  7:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a> - you make great points, but I think the community of people <i>using</i> the coded language defines itself pretty well.

That is, the problem with how you're saying it, Thor, is that it comes off to some as dismissive. Like, "It doesn't work, so don't even try."<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a reasoning that'll explain why this doesn't work, that I'm sure Thor will agree to, that my make the other side see why we're saying this. I'll try to display the problem as a stilted dialog:<br/>\n<br/>\nNewb: There's something wrong with using Jargon, because it's being used to keep people out.<br/>\nUs: Ouch... you're saying we're using jargon this way?<br/>\nNewb: Oh, no, not you guys, but some people.<br/>\nUs: Oh, yeah, that happens.<br/>\nNewb (or Fred): So, when you talk about stuff, please use everyday speech and explain your terms.<br/>\nUs: Oh, sorry, we weren't doing that?<br/>\nNewb: Well it didn't feel like it here.<br/>\nUs: Oh, I didn't realize that. I write a lot, and sometimes take shortcuts. I'll try to do better.<br/>\nNewb: Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that we, being humans and, thus, creatures of habit, fall into the same bad habits to some extent. Or, rather, I don't think that we have much of the bad habits. Essentially we'd be fools to say that nobody ever used jargon to be elitist or in a way that made somebody feel like they were being put upon to learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the iroic part is that those who will respond to this thread will be the ones who feel that they've done a good job, generally, and want to say that the jargon was not created in order to exclude anyone. It wasn't. It was created to shorthand discussions. For good or ill. And the people who are responding understand the potential problems of using the jargon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe behavior that needs to be changed belongs to people who aren't reading this thread, or who are, and are just dismissive of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to be effective, you have two options:<br/>\n- give the people here direct criticism of things they've done wrong, so they can improve.<br/>\n- find some magical channel that will get the real offenders to pay attention to the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the issue, see. Telling asshats that they shouldn't be asshats just doesn't work. I here define Asshat as somebody who people don't like for the very good reason that the Asshat doesn't care how other people feel, and doesn't do them any good (or even does them harm). Since they don't care that they're hurting people, they won't hear your plea and reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something we can do about Asshats, we can kill them... or the internet equivalent. We're actually pretty good at it as a community. So, if you see an Asshat, raise the alarm. I for one take perverse pleasure in doing them harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if I'm an Asshat...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68238/#Comment_68238" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T07:38:23+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  7:38AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would also point out that in science, much jargon is based on explaining something after the collection of a heap of data.

At the moment, the specialized language used in the indie game design community has many of the problems of academic language (opaque, inaccessible, decontextualized from common experience) but without actually drawing on the potential benefits of a corpus of peer-reviewed work (separation of serious and high-quality work from poor work, a consistently available archive of important works, a pressure to adhere to high standards of communication.)<br><br>There's something of a question about what field game design theory is going to wind up resembling when put in such an environment, which probably has more than anything to do with how well it can adapt an experimental, documentation-focused methodology. But a step like this really might be necessary now or in the near future.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68264/#Comment_68264" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T09:48:06+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  9:48AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I would also point out that in science, much jargon is based on explaining something after the collection of a heap of data.</blockquote>\nIn my (old) fields, sociology and philosophy, jargon is based on trying to understand a witness-able phenomenon. No "data amassing" required, just to see something, and then to attempt to put that something into words.  Sometimes good things result that greatly explain observed minutiae (social constructivism), sometimes attempts just fall into the dust and are forgotten or dismissed and moved past when something, anything, better comes along (structural functionalism/Talcott Parsons). <br><br>I think gaming theory takes the social science stance than the physical science stance.

How are Ron &amp; Co. at the Forge<i>not</i>the definitive source for what, say, GNS terminology means? It's their dang theory. Ditto Meguey Baker on Push/Pull, or r.g.f.a for Threefold Model?<br>The claim is that even the small community are not in agreement on their terminology.  So, Ron might have one definition in mind -- but other key members of the community have different views.  This was at best borderline in the case of the Threefold Model and rgfa, for example.  There continued to be regular arguments among rgfa regulars like Brian Gleichman, Kevin Hardwick, myself, and others about aspects of the Threefold Model for years.  The definition of Simulationism was pretty well hammered out, but there were arguments over Dramatism and Gamism.  My feeling is that there is even less consensus among Forge users about much of the GNS terminology.  <br><br>This varies depending on the terms, naturally.

based entirely on annecdotal evidence (starting with Professor Edwards). If you'd prefer to call it a RPG Hypothesis, that's probably not inaccurate. I'd say it's the closest thing to a cogent theory that exists, but I'd also agree with those who made the analogy before to music theory saying that we're not even to Bach. We may not even be far as to have the first actual theory yet. Again, Ron and others have said as much before.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the term experts, I'm not sure who proposed it. Theorists? Well, in that we call it a theory and discuss it. Not sure what the label matters here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I'm not sure what this has to do with the usefulness of the jargon. In terms of discussing the hypothesis or whatever it is, it's been useful to me, at least. And others, I'm pretty sure. Which is not to say that it's useful for everyone, either. People are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68281/#Comment_68281" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T10:53:40+00:00" title="May 10, 2007 10:53AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>The claim is that even the small community are not in agreement on their terminology.</blockquote>\nI thought the whole point of the Provisional Glossary and closing down the Theory forum was there was some consensus reached, at least as a starting point, and it was time to start applying the theory instead of continually arguing about it.<br><br>At the very least, that community is not re-defining the terms willy-nilly. The basic gist of the lexicon is set.

That's the nature of an invitational, generally speaking. And I don't think that makes it a bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nElitist is not a dirty word. It means that we have standards. Which is not agree that the jargon was created to be elitist. That's just an unintentional side effect. One which I'm on the fence about with regard to whether it's a good or bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, for those who do not know, there is, yes, a social circle that's involved here. I hope I do not kid myself that I am a member of it, but to enumerate others in this circle, the group looks like:<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam Dray<br/>\nAlexander Newman<br/>\nAndrew Cooper<br/>\nAndy Kitowski<br/>\nBen Lehman<br/>\nClinton Nixon<br/>\nEmily Care<br/>\nJared Sorensen<br/>\nJason Mornnigstar<br/>\nJohnathan Walton<br/>\nJoshua Newman<br/>\nJudd Karlman<br/>\nKeith Senkowski<br/>\nLuke Crane<br/>\nMatt Snyder<br/>\nMatt Wilson<br/>\nMeg Baker<br/>\nMichael Miller<br/>\nPaul Czege<br/>\nRalph Mazza<br/>\nRon Edwards<br/>\nSeth Ben-Ezra<br/>\nShreyas Sampat<br/>\nThor Olavsrud<br/>\nTim Klienert<br/>\nTony Lower-Basch<br/>\nTroy Costisick<br/>\nVincent Baker<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just off the top of my head (and a quick look around), and I hope that I don't insult anyone who belongs by their absence. The circle is at least three times this large - maybe far larger. By "social circle" I mean to say that pretty much everyone on that list has played RPGs with others on the list, had dinner with them, gotten drunk with them, shared rooms with them, etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd call most of the people on that list friends, in fact. Oh, sure, some of em hate my guts, but that'll happen in any social circle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also include the FATE guys, Rob and Fred, and John Kim, too. Even if they feel that they are iconoclasts for having to act as the conscience for the group on certain matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that if any newb is feeling that they're walking into an established social setting, that's perceptive - that's exactly what this site is. The group became a group because of The Forge. Because we all set certain standards there that lead to that being possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis site is no different, it just has different guidelines on what can be discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which is not to say that we don't like newcomers. In point of fact, new folks become part of this group all the time. I daresay that even Kynn is nearing being "in" at this point. I'd also point out that many of the group members got in despite being against the theory. Heck, Jonathan and Shreyas would like to be seen as being in full-scale rebellion most of the time, I get the feeling. The theory doesn't make us a social group. It's a willingness to be open and honest with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a penchant to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike any tribe, we've got our own language, yep. Does it, in part, serve to indicate who is in the tribe? As an accident, yes, it does. Do we use it to keep people out? No. One definitely does not have to know it to either participate, nor to understand us.<br/>\n<br/>\nCome on in, the water's fine. Get to know us... we'll get to know you. The group is growing at a tremendous rate, all things considered (the Nerdly events are expanding the social circle by leaps and bounds, I think - I wouldn't have said Fred Volke was part of the circle, for instance, until he managed to get to one). Everyone on that list joined the group at some time or other, myself included. No strings attached. The Cult of Ron Edwards (CORE), is about as benign and open an organization as could exist (if it did).<br/>\n<br/>\nImperfect? Yeah.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, just a little disclosure for those who may not be aware.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68343/#Comment_68343" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T13:59:10+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  1:59PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm stunned that some people actually compare the vocabulary used in science to the vocabulary used to  describe, discuss or design games.</blockquote>\nI agree with Andy; rpg theory is scientific, but only in the squishiest way.

The original issue was not "Is it wrong that we are friends and game together and developed our own short-hand code!"  The discussion is about the the fact that, even if there are fifty or a hundred people or even 300 in this band of siblings (to reuse an unrelated thread title) or this clique (to reuse the term used above), it's still a small group.  <br><br>Sure, small groups develop their own code and in-jokes.  My gaming circle does too.  But the discussion are opaque to anyone not buying in \u2014 because they are part of the circle, because they want to join the cool kids, because they went back and read the reams of previous discussions, whatever \u2014 &gt;99% of gamers who read the discussion move on because they find it obscure, pretentious, tedious, or simply empty.  <br><br>That really wouldn't matter if it wasn't that this style has become associated with "indie games."

I do a lot of technical writing in my job (i'm an engineer) and a characteristic of the reports I work on is that we try to hunt down jargon and kill it.

I found the Forge pretty opaque at first, too. But then I started reading Chris Chinn's blog, which wasn't opaque at all, IMO, which led me to the original essays, the Provisional Glossary, and Ben Lehman's pages. At it all rocked my world, and now I can read the Forge and pretty much get what's going on. I think the Actual Play forum is pretty jargon-free, anyway.<br><br>I suppose I just don't get the instant-gratification thing. Back in the Usenet days, it was basic netiquette that you should spend a month or so lurking on a group before posting so that you'd have a basic understanding of what the group's purpose was. The Forge makes it pretty clear that it's not a general RPG chat site, i.e., that it has a design and publishing agenda.

You put it on the market, and you even have discussion groups talking about making more kitchen implements or software and offering some support.  After a few years, your products are virtually unknown.  Yes, they have made a little headway and they work pretty well, but your tech support, your marketing, and your designers are really just the same persons; they're very enthusisatic about the products, but their discussion is held pretty much in in-house jargon.

When it comes to jargon, you choose to use a <b>more complicated language</b> because it provides some small ease to you and those who speak it, but makes it hard for others to follow.

Many games use "Conflict Resolution", "Stakes", and "Scene Framing" as well as a few others.  The Mountain Witch uses more than most, like "Fortune-in-the-Middle", "Fortune-at-the-End", "De-protagonizing", and others -- often footnoted with a brief explanation.  <br/><br/>Most games define a fair bit of jargon (i.e. Attributes, Skills, Drama Points, or whatever), though, so it's not like this is an inherent flaw.

If, say, 60-70% of the people on S-G can communicate much more easily through the use of shared referents, that's a good thing.<br/><br/>People invoke game-mechanics here all the time without much explanation.  "Oh, that's like Keys in <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>" or "Yeah, okay, so what you do is, you create a game that uses fan mail--you know, from <i>Primetime Adventures</i>."  Or, "I really like the click-and-lock stuff from <i>Capes</i> but I also love the initiation scenes from <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>--and this is my proposal to combine the two of them."  In these instances, it's not jargon per se, but it's still impenetrable: but now the barrier to entry is based on economics rather than attention span.  Why is one kind of exclusion infuriating, yet the other has gone unnoticed after almost 200 posts?<br/><br/>In any event, it's <i>handy</i> to refer to something complicated and abstract with a single word or phrase.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68835/#Comment_68835" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-13T21:43:24+00:00" title="May 13, 2007  9:43PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, but what they <i>don't</i> say in your examples is "Oh, that's like Keys," without telling where the term is from or even giving any context that the term refers to a mechanic from a specific game.

In the wild, so to speak, people use things like fan mail, bangs, keys, etc. all the time.  In principle, these are just a different kind of exclusionary language, and aren't too different from Forge Language.  "Kicker" has effectively become a jargon term, even though it's a highly specific game mechanic which (I believe, and I could be wrong) is unique to <i>Sorcerer</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69001/#Comment_69001" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T14:21:32+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  2:21PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough.
