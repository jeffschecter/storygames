Plus, hey, online music meetup!<br/><br/>Me? Currently little skill. I used to be a rave DJ in the mid-90s in the midwest circuits (Madison-Milwaukee-Chicago, once at Fat Cat in Manhattan), if it runs on a Technics-1200 I can make it dance, but otherwise nothing now.  Been interested in making my own tracks recently, but haven't followed up. So I will contribute little to nothing at all to this musician cataloging effort.<br/><br/>How about you all? What can you do acoustically? Electronically? Studio setup?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86078/#Comment_86078" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T08:39:26+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  8:39AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2007 8:43AM by Ken Sentowski!.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was in Junior High I hit a kid with my sax and got kicked out of band.

We've done twenty-two so far, not including our repertoire of weird Xmas songs we add to each season; among the former is a rock opera we managed to get produced as part of a local director's showcase about ten years back. The latter we performed at a local theater just 2-3 years ago.<br/><br/>Right now, I have Apple Logic Pro and Bias Peak running on my G5, and I use a MOTU 828mkII as my audio interface. For recent sessions, my goofy band will track using my rig, but then another guy takes the audio back to his home ProTools setup and does mixing. Back in the day, though, we'd use a 4-track tape machine, and plain ol' stereo cassette tape before that.<br/><br/>Instrument-wise, I've got a Fender Clapton Strat, Gibson 335S Professional, Taylor 6- and 12-strings, and a Warwick bass. I have a VHT Pitbull 45 amp that's gathering dust, as it's just easier these days to use my Yamaha DG-Stomp and go direct.<br/><br/>Whee!

Unfortunately, not without a bit of practice, i suspect. I used to be pretty good on the clarinet--played it all the way through middleschool and highschool. Tried to play it again last year, after a dozen years off, and discovered i'd completely lost the embouchure--i couldn't even sound bad. And that's despite playing bassoon consistently throughout that time, so it's not like i haven't been sticking a reed in my mouth.<br/><br/>Anyway, i seem to be in the minority here: tons of musical experience (25yrs of viola, 21yrs of bassoon, been playing recorder off-and-on for more than 3 decades), but pretty much all of it formal, and classical. So i can sightread damn near anything, but i never have picked up the knack of playing by ear. <br/><br/>I play bassoon, viola, and recorder, all of them well enough, at least at one time, to play professionally (i'm out of shape on all of them, becaus e ihaven't been pushing myself for several years now). I used to be able to play the entire clarinet family--yes, i even could make an e-flat clarinet sound not-bad. But with bassoon as my primary, I could also take everything up an octave or two, and drill a hole in a wall in a way nothing but a trumpet could top. It was the only thing that made pepband tolerable. I took years of piano lessons, but was never very good. And i played percussion with an afro-brazillian percussion ensemble for a couple years. That was a blast, and the one thing i wish my schedule hadn't forced me to give up.<br/><br/>Nowadays, in addition to still playing bassoon and/or viola in one of the local university groups, i get much of my music fix from DJing the university ballroom dance group, as well as dancing myself. I've been told i'm pretty good at both.<br/><br/><i>edit: doh! How could i forget: also used to be a really good singer, though i'm again a bit out of shape. Sang in the La Crosse Boys' Choir until my voice changed, at a period when it was compared favorably with the Vienna Boys' Choir. Haven't really sung formally since my voice changed, though i've still got a good sense of pitch and a good voice--so say my friends who are voice majors/voice instructors.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KristaE" title="KristaE"><img alt="KristaE" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KristaE">KristaE</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87690/#Comment_87690" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T19:42:17+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  7:42PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played piano for about 12 years and was pretty good at it, but I stopped once I got to college.
