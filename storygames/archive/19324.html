That's why, while I haven't GMed it yet, I'm intrigued by *World moves for the GM. <br/><br/>I like being given a bit more detail to riff off though. That means I have a fascination for random generators and randomisers beyond dice - <i>Story Forge</i>, <i>Everway</i>, even tarot and standard playing cards, such as jim pinto uses in <i>Protocol</i>. <br/><br/>I've seen a couple of posts here that kind of talk about using cards, such as Whimsy and the like. I was wondering whether anyone had had any long-term experience GMing on the fly with any of these of something similar.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430390/#Comment_430390" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T12:13:34+00:00" title="April  1, 2014 12:13PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've succesfully using<a href="http://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/8/" rel="nofollow"> my own random generation deck</a> for winging things on the campaigns I've been GMing, though it tends to produce way too random things if used without a solid setting. I'm upgrading it to handle an OSR game, though it would mean I have to turn it into a series of specialized decks; one for NPCs, one for monsters, one for dungeons, perhaps one for objects and equipment and one for wilderness. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16174/randomizer-for-framing-scenes-creating-challenges#Item_71" rel="nofollow">Here's the thread I keep about the development.</a><br/><br/>What I adore about cards is that they make way faster to handle any kind of random table. Random tables are already awesome, but whenever you use them in a middle of a game it means a pause of a couple of minutes of rolling the dice, consulting tables and then assembling the results in your head before framing the scene to the players. Now that I'm using this set of cards the time I take to do this doesn't interrupt the game flow at all and I can even show some of the results to the players to give them cues while they are roleplaying.<br/><br/>Tarot cards are actually the best for inspiration, however you need to interpretate quickly every draw, something I still find quite difficult. Yet I've found that having images is even better than having words for any randomizer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430401/#Comment_430401" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T19:25:31+00:00" title="April  1, 2014  7:25PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorites are Rory's Story Cubes, Osho Zen Tarot , and traditional Tarot decks.
