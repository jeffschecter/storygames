(it took me 3 sessions of playtesting to figure this out)<br/><br/>Here's why: While the person is reading the oracle, everyone is thinking about what the dragon could be.  Then they're jumping in with ideas, totally naturally, about what the dragon could be.  That puts the facts of the fictional world up for debate, and slows down the game in this really noticeable way.<br/><br/>The moment the Oracle is drawn is a very special moment.  The whole table has to jump in and very quickly go from loose ideas (oracle elements) to these very concrete setting elements.  We have to all start agreeing about what we're imagining in order to have momentum to get into character generation and then scenes, because if we don't we're going to be continuously asking permission to make assertions about the world.<br/><br/>A "debate what we're doing tonight" mentality is, IME, killer for In A Wicked Age.  The Oracle has to provide a strong hand on the tiller.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298779/#Comment_298779" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-29T12:23:11+00:00" title="October 29, 2010 12:23PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's neat.<br/><br/>I wonder what happens if you play straight but then as people are groking the cards' text and lining up the characters you just make an adaptation like, say, "oh, and that queen/sorceress/guardian?  That's a dragon." and go on.  I've played several times and little things have been done like that all the time.  I wonder if a big thing would cause the same kind of hiccup you witnessed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298782/#Comment_298782" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-29T12:36:14+00:00" title="October 29, 2010 12:36PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That kind of thing happens in my games too, but I like it coming organically from previous sessions or by weaving into other cards.<br/><br/>At an Oracle level I'd rather write a "dragon oracle" and say that the fourth card is drawn from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emprint" title="Emprint"><img alt="Emprint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emprint">Emprint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298790/#Comment_298790" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-29T14:09:48+00:00" title="October 29, 2010  2:09PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting experiment.
