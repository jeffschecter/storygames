I wondered if it really did, or if people just wanted these things because they're done so well in the original <i>Lady Blackbird</i>.<br/><br/>But I couldn't convince myself. I started again -- and this time I made strongly interlinked characters with explicit situation. I think it's a lot stronger.

What I'm hearing is a lot of calls for inter-linked characters and a strong starting situation. <br/><br/>These are things other Hackbirds (and the original) did really well, of course. Are you asking for these in my game because it's been done well in other Hackbirds or because you think they're necessary for any game with pre-generated characters?<br/><br/>I can see it being either of those scenarios, I'm just curious as to which it is. <br/><br/>The blurbs on the front cover were intended to replace the starting situation - letting the GM choose which suits them.

If you are using the same bones to build something more freewheeling or sandbox-y, I'd suggest calling that out so people (like me) don't get confused. Since I really enjoy the strongly positioned characters and situation-in-crisis, I'd love to see that built into your wonderful personalities and setting.<br/><br/>Example - when I read that the one guy was in love with Beatrice, I fully expected her to be a playable character in her own right.

Superheroes in medieval fantasy works well in my opinion, but with characters from such diverse and varied backgrounds, it may be good to have some suggested starting scenarios which bring them together, or something in their individual stories that draw them to on of the other characters.<br/>And I actually really like the front blurbs, as well as the descriptions of the lands. It gives some seeds to plant in a GM's imagination, allowing him to create his own, individual world.<br/>I am all for games where you don't particularly have a starting situation, so that it leaves more possibilities open to the characters. Instead, providing potential starting points may be better. The original Lady Blackbird could just have easily been about a group of Imperial bounty hunters who are seeking a runaway princess while unwittingly uncovering a plot to overthrow the government, or a band of outlaws who must escape their hideout when a mysterious caster with telepathic control over skysquids takes over.<br/>When I get around to doing a beta of my Castle Blackbird, I'm intending on going this route, where the rules are simply a canvas with rough sketches, for the GM and players to paint their own ideas upon, and with a variety of starting scenarios to use as potential (but not required) starting points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306914/#Comment_306914" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T09:35:37+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  9:35AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...and, by the way, I am instantly drawn to the Ink Demon.<br/><br/>Makes me want to do a hack mixing Call of Cthulhu with the anime series Read Or Die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307215/#Comment_307215" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T04:56:10+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  4:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi folks,<br/><br/>I took your comments into consideration, and I decided I couldn't justify leaving situation and interlinked characters out of a Hackbird.

It's pretty cool, too. Even without a history or gazetteer, I can get the feel of the setting pretty easily from the initial blurb. Still maybe a little nebulous to really be defined as a starting scenario, but again, I don't mind that.<br/>I like how varied and definitely "WWII Pulp" the characters feel. I particularly like how most all have Keys called "America," but the definition of the key is different for each. And I am entertained by the sample villains. It makes the Communist revolutionary in me want to rise up and defeat the corrupt Capitalist dogs! (...which, as WWII Pulp settings go, may be a bit odd...)<br/><br/>I think, though, that you should still try and flesh out the Wide Blue Yonder game as well. Given some character connections and example obstacles, it would work well. And I am keen on the idea of medieval superheroes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307272/#Comment_307272" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T09:13:12+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  9:13AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Michael - this new one looks rad, AND I was really intrigued by where you were going with the medieval folklore-heavy design before. <br/><br/>How many games mention Prester John, anyway? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307326/#Comment_307326" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T12:31:47+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 12:31PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, it looked just like a good game (a very good one,maybe).
