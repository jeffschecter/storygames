Changing a single innocuous-seeming word can radically change the meaning of a Key.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style="font-size:1.0em">Side-Note:  I'm not actually talking about whole Keys here, but rather their consituent parts ... not "Three ways you can earn XPs and one buyoff condition" but "One thing you can do, think or achieve that gets rewarded."</span><br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'm doing a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3453&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">whole list</a> of these, of the form "Take a reward if the reason you act is &lt; .... &gt;" and the question of how <i>exactly</i> to phrase things has really been giving me a beating.  Check out the differences between these three:<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) The reason you act is YOU WANT a great destiny<br/>\n(2) The reason you act is YOU MUST HAVE a great destiny<br/>\n(3) The reason you act is YOU HAVE a great destiny<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> leads to whininess:  "I'm not getting the destiny I want.  And I was going to go to the Tahashi station and pick up some power converters!"<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> leads to complacency and/or arrogance:  "Such petty setbacks are only a momentary footnote in the great tale of my inevitable ascension!"<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> though ... that means that if you don't have a great destiny <i>the world is out of whack.</i>  The phrasing implies that it's possible that your life is just one of meaningless trivia ... but that would mean something is terribly, terribly wrong.  Something, somewhere has failed ... maybe you.  To my mind, that's the phrasing that sings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way these things get phrased can inspire a lot of nuanced thinking in terms of the character.  Here's another example ... check out the difference between:<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) You don't want to fight someone you sympathize with<br/>\n(2) Fighting someone you sympathize with is wrong<br/>\n(3) You can't fight someone you sympathize with<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is so <i>weak</i>.  "Well, I didn't want to fight you ... but oh well."  Feh.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> or <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is better.  I personally like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> because it's a belief you can act from which is clearly not objectively true.  You <i><b>can</b></i> fight them ... you could physically do it.  But you can't ... because of who you are.  It's not merely wrong, it is something that you, personally, cannot do.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeys are so compacted ... so much expands out from them once they get put in play.  Ben Lehman describes this kind of design work as trying to get the right shape of hurricane by fiddling with the angle of a butterfly's wing.  It's precise, finicky work.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78050/#Comment_78050" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T08:23:48+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  8:23AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed, they're the haikus of RPG traits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78053/#Comment_78053" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T08:29:50+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  8:29AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to prefer wording them as aggressively as possible and making people choose to back out of them.
