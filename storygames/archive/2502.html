I dreamed it last night and woke up sort of excited about it.  <br/><br/>Bare bones:<br/><br/>So you have two guys in a conflict.  They each pick a number between, say, 1 and 50.  Then they take turns guessing.  First one to guess the other guy's number wins.  Not too exciting.<br/><br/>But!  One guy has an advantage.  He gets to make the other guy pick between, say, 1 and 25.  Or two advantages, and it's between 1 and 12.  Or three, 1 and 6.  Etc.  Both sides will invoke these advantages to reduce the number pool they have to guess from.  <br/><br/>OK, so that's the core conceit, but the really cool part is that the "number list" is really a list of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics a person might possibly have.  And when you force your opponent to limit it, you will have powerful indicators of what they will pick, based on the situation in which the conflict takes place.  So yeah, there are twelve possibilities left after you've invoked advantages, but you <i>know </i>he's scared and exhausted.<br/><br/>Or!  I might use this for the diagnostic mini-game in Medical hospital, where it is the clever diagnostician versus the insidious disease, which exists on a list of possible candidates.  In that usage there would be some currency passing around as well, probably related to the declining health of the patient.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_57837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57837/#Comment_57837" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T09:12:59+00:00" title="February 23, 2007  9:12AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Longer lists may increase tension, but I can't sit through more than 5 minutes of "Deal or No Deal."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_57838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57838/#Comment_57838" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T09:15:24+00:00" title="February 23, 2007  9:15AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What happens if the guys pick <b>two</b> numbers between 1 and 50.

I suspect that a lopsided-search could get you the <b>first</b> number sooner, at the cost of getting the second number later.  Like, if you guessed 35, and were told "Between" then you can now concentrate on whittling down the numbers from 36-50 first, and the numbers 1-34 later.<br/><br/>I do think that you'd want to bring the total range down a little bit to compensate though, yeah.

You have no advantage over me - list of 36 diseases, take your best shot as I slowly die.  <br/><br/>Instead, you have one advantage over me - "It's a parasite!" you exclaim, and now I have to choose from the 18 or so that have a parasite vector.  And you guess.  But you know I am a lion tamer, so that informs your choices.<br/><br/>You have two advantages over me - "It's a parasite, and it's vector is cat shit!"

That's how surgery and trauma currently work.  The way the game is structured, each scene has a unique mini-game and the same sort of scene cannot occur twice in a row.  But a failed diagnosis scene could kick up information that would lead to, say, a drama scene or a romance scene, and that could segue back into more diagnosis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_57887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce" title="MtFierce"><img alt="MtFierce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/5582955/1136400"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce">MtFierce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57887/#Comment_57887" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T12:59:18+00:00" title="February 23, 2007 12:59PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something about the resolution of this makes me think more of "Mastermind" than the old "Guess the Number" shtick.

Here is the extremely stripped-down version:<br><br>During early scenes the players try to earn Knowledge Points which allow them to define what the UFO looks like or characteristics about the aliens (based on their "visions").  As the game came to a head and the aliens were landing, the players pool their earned Knowledge Points in an attempt to figure out how to communicate properly with the aliens and not piss them off.  The communication mechanic was starting to take shape as something similar to Mastermind.  You get as many chances to guess as the group has Knowledge Points.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_57965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57965/#Comment_57965" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-24T07:09:18+00:00" title="February 24, 2007  7:09AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a fun game, Chris.

The doctor can bet up to six currency \xe2\u20ac\u201c when you correctly diagnose the illness, whatever remains will be doubled.  Others can place side bets for \xe2\u20ac\u201c or against \xe2\u20ac\u201c you.<br/><br/>If you are playing the patient, choose a condition and note the pathogen, vector, symptoms, and clue.  There will be 40 and they look like this:\n<blockquote><b>Melioidosis</b><br/>Pathogen:  Bacteria (There are  6, all but a very few have only one - yay meningitis!)<br/>Vector:  Animal, Contact (there are 6, they can double and triple up)<br/>Symptoms:  Fever, Swollen lymph glands, Skin lesion (There are 18, each illness has three)<br/>Clue:  Patient recently traveled internationally (There are 8, each illness has one.  Maybe I'll call it "etiology")<br/>Notes:  Melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium<i> Burkholderia pseudomallei</i>. Melioidosis is clinically and pathologically similar to glanders disease blah blah blah</blockquote>\nAdd three bogus pieces of information in any of those categories, however you like.  For example, you could choose Calicivirus (Virus, Food or Contact, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Cramps, and Patient lives or works in squalor) and add \xe2\u20ac\u0153Bacteria\xe2\u20ac\x9d as a bogus pathogen, a Rash as a bogus symptom, and \xe2\u20ac\u0153Patient routinely handles animals\xe2\u20ac\x9d as a bogus clue.  You\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll want to carefully place these to mask the real illness.  <br/><br/>In the initial diagnosis scene, if you are the patient player you will reveal the symptoms and clues through a roleplayed intake interview.<br/><br/>In each diagnosis scene, including the first, if you are the doctor you will attempt to acquire a single piece of evidence related to the illness.  If you win the diagnosis game, you get to request one of the following:<br/><br/>1.  The pathogen of the illness.<br/>2.  The vector of the illness.<br/>3.  Whether a single piece of information is, in fact, bogus.  <br/><br/>For example, if you know that the patient has a faver, fatigue, and has been vomiting after eating an extravagant meal to celebreate her return from Peru, you might ask if the whole fancy meal thing is a red herring.  <br/><br/>At the conclusion of any diagnosis scene, as the doctor you can elect to announce your diagnosis.  <br/><br/>If you choose to wait, one point of currency slips away forever.  <br/><br/>If you choose to announce your diagnosis, no currency is lost.  If you are correct you double the remaining currency.  If you are incorrect the patient has a crisis and a trauma scene ensues.  You can continue trying to reach a correct diagnosis in future scenes \xe2\u20ac\u201c if they survive the trauma surgeon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s tender mercies.  So rockin', any thoughts?

If you're looking for something practical that's not strictly one-way, a common trick is to take advantage of the fact that it's quicker for humans to multiply large numbers together than it is to factor them.  <br><br>So Alice picks two six-digit numbers and multiplies them together, sending the result to Bob.  Bob then makes a guess about the qualities of one of the two numbers Alice chose, like "The larger number is even" or "The smaller number is odd".  Alice reveals the two numbers and Bob can verify that they multiply as shown.<br/><br/>If you were doing this over the Internet, you'd probably use md5sums or SHA1 checksums.  <br/><br/>There may even be neat arithmetic tricks you can do with a pocket calculator that result in effectively one-way functions.
