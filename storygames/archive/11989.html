It's a safe and happy village, most days, though you have seen darker times as well - the Ogre Raids of 1114, the rise of the Hakeman Fellowship in 1116-1117. On the whole, though, you've led a happy childhood in Momber.<br/><br/>But you've always dreamed of adventure, and of joining the Border Patrol. This fierce group of protectors and adventurers patrols the border of the Menden Region, as well as conducting courageous explorations of local ruins, campaigns against evil wizards, and promoting goodness and justice in all of Menden.<br/><br/>And so you've been training, with wise Falcon, with cunning Fox. You've been preparing yourself for the day that a yellow parchment would arrive with their crimson stamp, inviting you to join the Border Patrol when they next travelled through your town.<br/><br/>The Border Patrol will arrive in Momber in two days. You'll be leaving after that, and only ever stopping in for a day on every 4 month tour. You've got two days to ready your affairs.<br/><br/><b>What's one thing that you do before leaving, and how does it go?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268042/#Comment_268042" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T08:13:31+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  8:13AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I attend Lillian's wedding.

We'd been lovers for years, but she'd broken it off six months earlier when I'd refused to abandon my goal of joining the Border Patrol. I'd chosen perilous danger over her hand, and it hurt her.<br/><br/><i>But I'd never really had a choice, anyways.</i><br/><br/>She grits her teeth, turns back to the priest, and says "I do" with stunning conviction.

He's worried about me but won't admit it, and with me gone he'll need to man up a little around the farm. So we go to the marsh to spear frogs, and I make sure we take the old post road and stop for lunch near the Pondo's farm on the way back. My kid brother is sweet on their daughter Ev. All the Pondo clan comes out to wish me well, and lunch turns into a big thing, we cook up our frogs and there's some clowning and good-natured fighting, and I let my brother beat me a time or two and show off. On the way home I give him my frog gig and let him know Mom's counting on him, and me, too, and I'll send money when I can but money won't till the fields. I tell him I like Ev and her dark aspect and that he should take it slow with her.

He's always been a condescending asshole and now I'm leaving, so I can let loose all the anger I've been storing up for six years. I won't be around for him to kick around anymore. Sure, everyone thinks he's the bee's knees, but most people don't know what a sadist he is. I'm not talking "paint the fence" stuff. I'm talking burns from hot irons and whippings. I can't wait to be free of him.<br/><br/>So I storm right into the back yard where he has the wooden dummies set up and just let him have it. It's a speech I've been writing for years but it's interrupted about half way through when Krakabane backhands me. I didn't even see it coming. I didn't know the old guy could move so fast. My ears are ringing and my sight goes white for a few seconds. I realize I'm on the ground and I can see him towering over me.<br/><br/>"That's right, boy. Learn that lesson now, before you open your mouth like that to someone less kind than I."<br/><br/>I start to say something, but he kicks me in the face.<br/><br/>"I said learn that lesson! Are you stupid, boy?"<br/><br/>I get up slowly and limp out of the yard and go to nurse my wounds. The Border Patrol shows up and my new sergeant looks at me balefully, shaking her head. Then I see Krakabane. He's got his pack and his sword. <br/><br/>Shit. <br/><br/>Krakabane is coming, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268192/#Comment_268192" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T17:04:29+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  5:04PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I go give my precious books to the town's storyteller.<br/><br/>I wait until late at night, so nobody can see the tears coming from my eyes. I grab my uncle's wheelbarrow and put all the books in there. At the old man's house, I finally crack down. He paternally and respectfully pats my back, letting my weeping continue. After I'm done, I start giving him the books one by one.<br/><br/>At that, I almost start crying again. I hold them in such a high esteem, and treasure the bold and fantastic stories I have read for so many years. From the moment my old friend taught me how to read, they were my loyal companions for countless nights. Always dreaming and longing, my very own adventures are about to become true.<br/><br/>The storyteller receives the books with great honor and pride. He smiles at me and tells me that he is only borrowing them for safekeeping. But that the service won't come cheap. I have to return one day with fresh and exciting new stories for him to tell, and then I'll have my books back.<br/><br/>The next morning, my eyes are red, but my spirit is high. Most of my life I spent with stories. Now I'm about to begin mine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268196/#Comment_268196" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T17:30:10+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  5:30PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sit with my father, quietly, in front of the fire.

I can't wait to plunge a sword into his belly; I hope he'll be the first person I ever have to kill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268357/#Comment_268357" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T13:12:19+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  1:12PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I go to Lacy's hut, the one her family built when she jumped the broom with Anson. I don't have nothing to say, not to her, or her toe-headed baby. She made her choice when she knew I wasn't gonna stay. Not when I got the post. Not when I can get out and make a name. <br/><br/>Anson's not around. Probably out herding pigs or busting sod. He can keep the dirt and the sweat and the stink. Lacy's there and she comes out. I can tell she still likes me, wishes I was around. She also has that baby on her hip. I know what she is doing. Doesn't matter, same eyes or not. Da paid the commission, and I'm gone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
