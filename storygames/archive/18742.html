Trouble is they'd picked a ultra-freeform 'be inspired by pictures' game and it crashed and burned. Not the game's fault, in their situation they needed something with more structure and guidance. I have about 60 seconds to engage them with something else before they wander off. There's no point me just pitching them other games because they're not going to bite at them, I need to hook them into an exercise immediately that will provide structure and also support their creative thinking. What, if anything, can I do?<br/><br/><br/>2) The anxious teen<br/>A 15 year old playing Monsterhearts, largely because their friend wanted to play it. Naturally they've created a stand-offish 'loner' style character who doesn't have any real goals and creatively they're completely blocked. Every time I go to them and ask "What do you do?" they say "I don't know". This is not an aggressive "I don't know". Now, I could sit them down and take them through Keith Johnstone's chapter on spontaneity or I could sketch out all their options each time but I've got four other players to take care of. Any suggestions as to what I can do in this situation to help the player clear their block? I'm happy to accept opinions along the line that I should have done more at the start of the session (warm-up exercises etc) or required greater connection between their PC and the others.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420584/#Comment_420584" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T15:00:46+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  3:00PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that the "I don't know" player is often afraid of sounding dumb, or having their idea shot down.

Only thing that could be done there would be to switch into GM heavy mode and have things happen at them, but setting your phasers on stun instead of desintegrate. People can actually roleplay instinctively, but you need some more practice to became confident enough to create and negotiate the fiction with other people as a second nature.<br/><br/>Its kinda the same with the anxious teen, he's still learning to dominate strong emotions and then he's asked to do so (playing with strangers in an unusual situation can make some people hiperventilate) and also come up with creative input, which he probably feels must be really good in order to impress other players and not suffer an adverse reaction from the group (being perceived as "not cool" can be a torture for a teenager, even when this doesn't bring any other consequence)<br/><br/>As I said, I'd turn the game into easy automatic mode, suggest choices and get their opinion on those first, or detailing the fiction more until some choices become clearer. More than inspire the player, the idea is to built a safe space for them, show them that it's just a game and that their fedback doesn't have to be perfect nor breathtaking. They'll usually relax and go into a creative mood of their own when the pressure on them eases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420604/#Comment_420604" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-23T05:21:36+00:00" title="August 23, 2013  5:21AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2013 5:22AM by Rickard.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>2) The anxious teen</blockquote>\nThese last few months, I've been on and on about how roleplaying games are bad at teaching creativity; to address spontaneity; to release people from blocking themselves. My last convention I attended to, it was an anime convention where I could find beginners to try out my short game that was based around creative challenges. It's that kind of convention that also has a slight majority of female attenders, and when I was pitching games, one told me that she hadn't played roleplaying games before. "Sure", I told her with confidence. "That's no problem. I love beginners".<br/><br/>Of course, as you can imagine. It was a problem. I was going through my usual exercise on how to communicate, and I did that with two other guys, so she could sit and watch, and in my mind learn. We had a fourth player - she didn't want to join - but during the game, she was excited and gave ideas anyway. She played, but without a character. But it was this one girl that took her time, and I could tell that she was self-censoring, trying to come up with the "best" descriptions of what her character was doing. I mean, my game is about pulp. It's about clich\xe9s. It's about having fun describing. I told her that. Contentiously. It even says so on the character sheet. And I told her to take her time, because she was a beginner, and that nothing she said could be wrong. I even asked leading questions to help her on the way on how to think. I made the others, through the initial exercise, to also ask questions (and not to give examples! Those are mind blocking!). Whenever she came up with something, I praised that (but I wonder now if I didn't praise her behavior having to think things through for 2-3 minutes). But still, a game that usual took 70 minutes to play, now took 2,5 hours. We had fun, but I'm still not satisfied with my contribution to not let her mental block go away.<br/><br/>I should have stopped the game and done an exercise with her. Probably that one Keith Johnstone talks about where a person is asked to make up a story. When that seems impossible, then I will tell that person to make up a story and let the other person ask questions about my story, which I should answer "yes", "no" or "maybe" to. The thing is that I haven't made up a story, so I can randomly give any answer to the questions and by doing that, actually making the person who were asking me to make up a story. That should show that person how easy it is to make up  a story. Is it right to stop the game to sort things out with just one player? Well, is it as fair to kind of ignore a player's behavior and let the other people endure that all through the session? The time it takes to do an exercise to release spontaneity can as well be regained because that person isn't breaking the flow later on.<br/><br/>But one thing I learned was that even if I've been going on about how roleplaying games are bad at teaching creativity, I'm not even there yet myself. It was a refreshing experience, and I learned something about myself from it.<br/><br/>And btw, if you ever want to playtest a game. Go to anime conventions. You will have the best of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420606/#Comment_420606" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-23T06:47:32+00:00" title="August 23, 2013  6:47AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anime conventions...

The reflection. It's too late for those whovians but I think that if the game would've stopped and a discussion took place, they would've gotten an understanding of why the game sucked and remained positive to roleplaying games, possibly trying another. I do, however, feel that <b>Richard</b> answered his own question in the first situation: "Not the game's fault, in their situation they needed something with more structure and guidance."<br/><br/>Don't ever play weird ass games without hard structures with beginners. They have enough problem sinking in the whole concept of roleplaying games.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>* I actually think some roleplaying games should benefit of having discussion phases of what just happened, and if the group should replay the event and what should be changed in the start of the scene.

Then the solution is play a system you find easy to describe and a setting/genre you know they will grok. For me, in that situation, that would have been either Wushu or ...In Spaaace! and a Doctor Who setting (maybe being falsely accused by the Jodoon or stumbling across a cyberman invasion). As far as exercises, I just try and bake that into character generation. Pick a game with easy character generation and have the newbies make the characters at the table. They can learn something about their character, a bit of the game terminology and something of the setting. It takes time and can be tenuous if the situation is already strained, but it also gives the players a lull to mull it over and back out without messing up anyone else's fun if they are just not digging it, while giving them a chance to ease into it if they are genuinely interested.<br/>2) I will be honest, the only time I have seen "I don't know" was a player that was afraid of "messing up." I feel like the problem is geek culture is bad at building up trust. We deride people when they say star wars when they mean star trek. Or if they don't know the difference between a android and a cyborg. Or if they don't have an opinon of which Doctor is best. Or if they don't know who Faramir is. The point is, good roleplaying needs trust. If that is not there, you will get "I don't know." So, you have to do a few things in combination. One, "if you say it, do it." In other words, "don't say I will not judge your contribution," and follow it up with a judgement. Two, be encouraging, then they do give you something besides "I don't know," praise it and use it with your contributions moving forward. Three, lead by example, be the player you want to see. If your processes are internal, make them verbal. Be transparent and accessible to all the players at the table. Four, Work through your thought process as if it were your character with the player. So, what is the first question you ask yourself? For me it would be what would my character want from this situation? Followed by how would they go about getting that? Followed by would this mess up anyone else's fun? Then go! In other words, teach them how you do it. Even if they don't like the way you do it, it gives them a foundation to build their own method off of, right?<br/><br/>  Anyways, it sounds like you did the best with what you had. I wouldn't kick myself over it. Just see if I can improve and move on (much like you are doing now).

Reading it all through and thinking on it, I have a better idea of what I should have done.<br/><br/>1)<br/>With the Whovians, you're all quite right that you shouldn't game if people aren't in the mood (and an exercise is just a stripped down game). What I should have done is ask some questions about their earlier roleplay experience, ask them what about it they enjoyed, so that they end the session thinking about when they had fun rather than focused on the down experience they just had. Then, based on their answers, I can make a couple of recommendations for games that they would enjoy for _next time_. At least then, should they return, they have a bit more guidance.<br/><br/>2)<br/>The 15 year old is a tough situation. I really liked what was said about accepting their indecisiveness being an equally viable offer that I could accept. This is not Microscope, it's not important that everyone contributes to the same degree. This is a GMed game where the GM is your biggest fan. So long as I continue to give the teen an equal opportunity to contribute then it should be okay for them to wait, watch more experienced players narrating, the plot will rumble along (MOTW style) and they can jump onboard when they like.<br/><br/>Really, though, the in-game difficulties were just a symptom of my fundamental mistakes in set-up: the PC simply lacked a clear motivation or strong feelings about any of the other characters. I could see at set-up that this was going to be a problem, but I didn't do anything to address it. If I'd seen the same thing in an acting situation, I would absolutely have been fine to do additional exercises to improve the situation. I should feel equally empowered running as GM.<br/>\n<blockquote>I actually think some roleplaying games should benefit of having discussion phases of what just happened, and if the group should replay the event and what should be changed in the start of the scene.

Maybe the subway blows up a few seconds after the man in the black coat gets on -- so it was good the player stayed at the station. <br/><br/>Another thing that might be useful is to ask what they mean by "I don't know."

(notice I said simple, not easy.  there is a difference) Ask what their favorite moment of the game was.  Listen to the story, and walk them through abstracting it out to the core of what made it a fun moment. Was it the story, or was it their actions that made it fun?  Did they like listening to a cool story that they were part of, or did they like telling a story that the GM was simply adjudicating? Was their greatest victory a lucky roll of the dice, a bit of clever problem solving, or was it a sense of drama? If you are trying to give them something they would like, start with finding out what it is that they like.  I have never had much trouble getting people to tell me about things they thought were fun.  Once you know what they liked and didn't like, you can suggest exercises that either make the fun parts better or more frequent, or make the bad parts easier to deal with.<br/><br/>2) The teen<br/>The most important thing: they have to care.  If they do not care, then there is no problem- gloss over them, because they will never be happy in your game, and that does not reflect badly on you or them. Everyone has thought something would be fun, but it turns out that the thing is not as much fun as you thought it would be. Assuming that they do care, or can be engaged enough to start caring, you can still guide them without railroading them.  To find out where someone wants to go, first you have to know where they are.   Making sure they have a firm grasp on who their character is and what they want is a good place to start.  Even standoffish loners have a moral framework.  That framework is what all actions are based off, especially when there are no goals to fall back on.  Finding out enough key points of a characters moral framework without an uncomfortable interrogation is not always easy, but it can usually be done fairly quickly. If you understand the moral framework, then you can narrow down the choices, and that makes things easier for the player.   <br/>e.g. The characters walk into a room, and meet someone of striking qualities (bad or good), the question 'what do you do?' becomes more directed- 'You said that you are really cautious.

The subtext was, "All my actions will be futile, and it's your fault."  The game goes,<br/><br/>"Well, how about.."<br/>"Yes, but I can't do that because.. "<br/>"Oh, well.. how about.."<br/>"Yes, but I can't do that because.."<br/><br/>The counter-script is to stop making suggestions, and to simply be a witness to their indecision.

Engage them in a discussion about playing a Doctor Who game, perhaps even with the rules from last night.  Or engage them on how those rules could be improved for a Doctor Who game.

As a fairly proactive player (although thankfully I hope an inclusive one) I _just don't get it_ but view that as my failing, not theirs. It combines with the player that does nothing at the table and when you ask how things could be improved tell you that they are having the best game ever.<br/><br/>I'm interested how being made a focus of attention triggers an anxious gamer to come out and be more proactive rather than making themselves even less significant to make the attention go away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421202/#Comment_421202" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-07T13:16:08+00:00" title="September  7, 2013  1:16PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2013 1:16PM by Paul_T.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "give them the MacGuffin" concept, I think, has some potential. I don't have a huge amount of experience with this, but I can relate at least one incident which sounds similar to me. I once had a fantasy game where I had a player who, although he said he was enjoying himself, spent most of the game sitting quietly and not doing much of anything.<br/><br/>I tried various things - once he came out of his shell when his character entered a contest (a sword sparring, non-lethal contest) and LOST. I asked him to describe his failure, and he suddenly came to life, delivering a surprisingly emotional and dramatic description of his character's disastrous defeat. But nothing really stuck.<br/><br/>So a situation came about where some of the other player characters had a thorny problem and they needed a solution. It seemed believable that the quiet player's character could be the authority on this kind of matter, so I told them, "Ah, the [quiet player's character] is the person who has final say over this kind of problem: you'll have to go to him and consult him if you wish this to be resolved."<br/><br/>This put him in a position of authority, and the other characters had to come to him for advice and decision-making. This finally completely engaged him in the game, and he seemed to really enjoy himself.<br/><br/>I think this is similar to what Fang is talking about.

Both players were shy, and it was in two different groups with two different GMs. What I'm doing instead is giving them a sideline in the story that they can progress as they like. Putting them in authority position creates pressure from the other players, and some people want to take things in their own pace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421206/#Comment_421206" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-07T16:14:55+00:00" title="September  7, 2013  4:14PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2013 4:15PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think giving the quiet player the MacGuffin and/or the position of authority is more likely to work well if they're already secure in their knowledge of the setting and confident that they understand what's going on.<br/><br/>If you drop that stuff on a player whose "I don't know" is largely based on not knowing (or possibly not caring) about the setting and the kinds of situations that occur in that setting, you'll still get "I don't know," only this time you'll make them feel like you're trying to put a spotlight on how shitty they are at your game. That's not good.<br/><br/><br/>It's why I usually take the advice about making sure a new player's first game is in a setting/genre they already know well. For my generation, that was stuff like Star Wars, or possibly Ghostbusters or Call of Cthulhu with some people. Whatever they're really into, if it's hardboiled detective stories or James Bond movies or romance novels or superhero comics, that's what we'll do for their first game. Now they can focus on learning the rules and having fun instead of also having to learn the setting and the genre expectations and what makes sense and what doesn't make sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421222/#Comment_421222" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-08T21:37:12+00:00" title="September  8, 2013  9:37PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, I remember a case of gaming where two words guaranteed one player would bring his A game.

I remember how much fun Blix was having with the unicorn horn, until Darkness came for it in <em>Legend</em>.  This means something about the introvert begins attracting trouble for everyone.

Performing is not easy.  The OP's example says that the nervous teen was playing because the friend wanted to play.  I've experienced making a decision or taking an action that didn't end up going well, and afterwards the gaming group just couldn't let it go, and had to constantly needle about it.  RPGers are a less than forgiving or particularly welcoming crowd, in my experience.  As Judd mentions, the fear of being judged as in adequate (and the risk of being harassed over it afterwards) or not getting the specialized references of the game being played.  I don't have a clue what Monsterhearts is about.  <br/><br/>This is the problem with running obscure games at a con.  If you take something that is widespread and easily recognized like what Edge of the Empire does with Star Wars, you're less likely to leave people not knowing what to do.  Likely it's a combination of reasons that give the "I don't know" response.  Was the premise of the game actually framed in recognizable tropes?  If you play Zorcerer of Zo it's easy enough to get people to grok what it's about: "Fairy tales crossed with Shrek".  As to having all the moves on the Monsterhearts character sheet, that may or may not be helpful depending on how much jargon is on the character sheet, or for that matter, the particular use of "move" in that game.  If we're negotiating, then a new player may not grok that you can use a move for that as well.

My experiences have been with groups of friends, so my knowledge doesn't extend to roomfuls of strangers. I've got some players who are super comfortable with improv and some who aren't. I had one regular player who came from a dysfunctional group and he was palpably frightened of having input on the world. We asked him about his holy warrior's religion and he straight up said "isn't it the GM's job to make the religions? I don't want to ruin his setting."<br/><br/>It's a real thing that happens. But not the <i>only</i> thing that might make a player hesitant, for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421352/#Comment_421352" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T02:02:18+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  2:02AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, I'm thinking about what, "I don't know," can mean.<br/><br/>Different reasons for I don't know:<br/><br/> - I don't have enough details to dig into and need some more.<br/><br/> - I'm overwhelmed with input and I'm not sure where to dig in.<br/><br/> - I'm scared that my input will be judged as lacking.<br/><br/> - I'm not plugging into the media references this game is based on.</blockquote>\nI think you can probably rank these depending on the type of player, so a newcomer to gaming is likely to be suffering worry that they will do the wrong thing (nominally 3 in that list) probably mixed with a fear that there is so much going on that they haven't got it (2). An experienced player is more likely to show 1 or 4.<br/><br/>The problem at Cons is you've no idea the best buttons to push to get players out of that situation. Considering with one shots you can't really just leave them to sort it out over time (because they run the risk of 'getting it' just as you say 'game over', although I guess that means they might still come back for more) so what might be useful is an idea of the questions needed to get to the crux of where the 'don't know' is coming from.<br/><br/>With option 3 potentially putting them in any position where they have to suggest a solution, and there are plenty of solutions, is the way to go. Making sure that pretty much whatever they pick has a positive reaction to it (even if it doesn't nessecarily get a positive outcome). I get the feeling this goes back to stuff suggested right near the top of the thread though :-)<br/><br/>At the end of the day, with a Con one-shot you need a way to work out if the situation can be fixed or needs to be lived with. Not everyone is going to move away from 'I don't know' and sometimes it's better for the game to recognise this and stop spending spotlight time trying to fix it. (Like the guy in my recent Don't Rest Your Head game who was fixated on getting peoples testimonials over *everything else*, there's an alien invasion, he is in the alien mothership, he turns to the alien abductee and says "about that list of names of other alien abductees you have, can we go and get it now?")<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421398/#Comment_421398" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T16:08:52+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  4:08PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...whenever he was at a loss for what to do, he went back to "I"m Batman!"
