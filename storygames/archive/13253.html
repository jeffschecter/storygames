One was to have an advertising package available for designers / production companies. Another is having a merch-style table, to be staffed by the con personnel, to sell small-press stuff by indie designers (especially those in attendance). <br/><br/>the advertising options that we're tossing around would include space for physical banner ads, website ads or inclusion in a link list, inclusion in promo material (logo on poster, ad in program). Though we conceived this more for local businesses, we could offer your products as an advertised prize for winning a particular instance of playing a game (I admit it would initially seem strange to win a copy of Panty Explosion for winning a game of Civilization, but there might be a really awesome tweak to this idea, or an awesome application of it: and games could be paired effectively). There was also an idea that attendees could earn a discount on buying certain games which they played at the con, based on game-producer participation.<br/><br/>The merch table could operate on a buy-in-per-product-you-want-sold-on-the-table, or on a percentage-of-how-much-you-made-in-sales-at-the-con model. What seems more sensible to you?<br/><br/>oh, for added info, we're looking at 6 on-site vendors, mostly hobby game stores or production companies, not private folks re-selling their collections. There would be a finite amount of advertising, exclusively in "good spots". Though monopoly-the-game might not get much play, we're looking at offering other types of monopolies to advertisers / vendors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>to state clearly: i know little about making money as an indie game designer. Do these options seem enticing to you? Solid? Flawed? <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298337/#Comment_298337" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-26T12:11:43+00:00" title="October 26, 2010 12:11PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were to come with products, I'd be most enticed by the model whereby I get to check my merchandise in at a staffed table, and they take a cut of everything they sell. If that percentage were 10-20%, I wouldn't bat an eye and would gladly accept. If that percentage were higher than 20%, I'd have to start number crunching, and might end up deciding to do backpack sales instead.<br/><br/>The percentage-of-sales model involves zero risk, which means the little guy with his first product at his first con has nothing to lose by putting his art out into the world. That's a delightful notion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298569/#Comment_298569" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T03:45:44+00:00" title="October 28, 2010  3:45AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would be interested in advertising depending on projected turn out, prices, and where the advertising would be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298570/#Comment_298570" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T04:08:03+00:00" title="October 28, 2010  4:08AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We offer vouchers as conventions prizes, with the amount varying with the level of support the convention is providing for our games (ie people running games), and the size of convention.

We will donate limited amounts of product to shows for their own use as gifts or whatever no problem. At most cons we also offer discount vouchers as prizes for events to drive people into the dealer rooms at all. I've never been to a show where the con itself offered a staff merchandise table, but since IPR as a guest would represent many of those indie pubs, it would be duplicated work if we were also there. When groups like the GPA offer merchandise showcases, it's generally paid for on a per-shelf basis to ensure everybody gets a fair amount of space; I'd be curious to see the results of a "pay a percentage of your sales" setup because I've considered that myself but never seen it done. dw                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298707/#Comment_298707" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T21:33:55+00:00" title="October 28, 2010  9:33PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2010 9:34PM by Steve_Segedy.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>Another is having a merch-style table, to be staffed by the con personnel, to sell small-press stuff by indie designers (especially those in attendance).</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Darren Watts</cite>I've never been to a show where the con itself offered a staff merchandise table, but since IPR as a guest would represent many of those indie pubs, it would be duplicated work if we were also there.</blockquote>\nThe main difference being people at the merch table who were knowledgeable about the products and able to actually influence sales.  Essentially you'd be relying on the play experience and word of mouth to drive interested parties to the table for a simple transaction.  I'd agree with Joe's estimate that that's probably worth 10-20%, just so I wouldn't have to carry around a bunch of books and try to handle a wad of cash or credit card purchases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
