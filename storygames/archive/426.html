                    I'm going to be running <i>The Mountain Witch</i> in two weeks time. I've made an outline of the Acts and Scenes (pretty much according to the model in the book). In each scene I've listed some creatures or obstacles to throw at the characters. In a few cases, I've tried to make them bangs related to certain Dark Fates, but otherwise, the encounters are just that. I'm not creating any kind of "plot", just laying out what I hope are character oriented land mines for them to blow themselves up with.<br/><br/>I also made up some NPCs who are like the Witch's lieutenants - Yuki Onna, Gazo (an Oni general), Gotoku Neko (starts off as an annoying little cat and later turns out to be a monster) and that Ravenstone character from one of the APs I read. <br/><br/>I know that I may not even use half of the encounters and bangs I've set up, and I know I'll be adjusting and creating stuff on the fly, listening to the players create their own nooses I can use to hang their characters with. Beyond this outline I'm not going to do anything else, nor am I going to add anything else to it, but I'm just wondering by even doing this much if I'm overdoing it? I need it I think, simply as a reference for pacing and timing, and to remind myself of all the cool critters I can use.                </div>

                            As long as you know that you may not use everything, I think you're all good. Personally, I usually only prep for one session at a time, which is usually only two or so chapters. Since players can explicitly add stuff via their Fates, I find their foreshadowing or other Fate-related narrations often change what I was thinking of doing. So I figure it's best not to prep too far ahead. But there's nothing wrong with what you did.                        </div>

                            Any good Dark Fate specific bangs you've used that you could share? I have some for the easy ones like Unholy Pact and Desperately in love. Some of the others are so character specific I'll just have to think of something in play after hearing what the players are doing with them.                        </div>

                            I'm aiming for two. Maybe three at the outside, but we'll extend it only if necessary (it's very hard for us to schedule 7 people together on the same day).<br/>
<br/>
We usually go for about 6 hours in a session, but I'm thinking we may actually require less time for this, so I'm estimating 4 - 6 hours each.  I dunno, I'm perfectly willing to let the players take character stuff wherever they want to go with it, and I think with that much time we have a nice cushion. I'm pretty sensitive to pacing issues though, and the moment things slow down I have quite a few grenades to throw at them.<br/>
<br/>
So my outline is like this (none of this is hard and fast - I'd rather have more than I need and be able to edit on the fly):<br/>
<br/>
Session 1<br/>
Act 1: Intro <br/>
Chapter 1 - Through the Forest: 4 scenes<br/>
<br/>
Act 2: Building Tension<br/>
Chapter 2 - Up the Mountain (overland or underground): 3 scenes<br/>
Chapter 3 - Into the Fortress (the outer grounds): 3 scenes<br/>
<br/>
Session 2<br/>
Act 3: Fates Revealed<br/>
Chapter 4 - In the Keep (lower levels): 3 scenes<br/>
Chapter 5 - In the Keep (upper levels): 3 scenes<br/>
<br/>
Act 4: Conclusion<br/>
Chapter 6 - The Bloody Climax: 1 scene <br/>
<br/>
So, 10 total scenes for the first 1/2 and 7 for the second half. I'll of course be mindful of letting things blow when they're ready, and I expect to probably rewire some stuff between the first and second sessions to take what's gone down into account.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a nice list of creatures to use, a big list of stuff to decorate the backgrounds with (color). I think I'm good to go mostly. Got maybe 6 Dark fate oriented bangs - maybe all I need really - I'll inevitably work up some more at the table.                        </div>

                            You sound really, really prepared.  If I were you I wouldn't do much more, particularly to prep for the later acts, since so much can change so fast.                        </div>

                            Well, a new wrinkle has appeared for my TMW game on the 16th.<br/>
<br/>
A co-worker of mine, upon hearing about the details of my hobby (which I have been telling her about in passing), just today started making noises about being interested in joining in. She's never played any RPG before at all, but has the soul of a gamer geek and I'd like to see it flower.<br/>
<br/>
I invited her to join our upcoming game. She's a bit unsure, so I'm trying not to overwhelm her with my enthusiasm (yet).<br/>
<br/>
I'll have 6 full-on gamers with decades of experience there (including myself) and one total newbie. All the other guys are good people, I'm sure they will welcome the newbie and help her along if she comes. I wonder what people think about this sort of mix? <br/>
<br/>
Although I have access to a big contact list of players, I cherry picked my crew for the game, choosing people I know I can count on to open up, stay loose,  and get with the program. I want to bring the newbie in simply because she has no "gamer baggage" to slow her down or trip her up.<br/>
<br/>
How does The Mountain Witch play for total roleplaying newbie?                        </div>

                            Do you have six or seven players? I'm a little confused. I've never played with over six players, largely because I could only come up with 6 good Fates. You would have to double up Fates or something if you have over 6 players.<br/><br/>But other than that, tMW is one of those rare games that actually works <i><b>better</b></i> the more players you have. People start weaving their Fates together, you see more alliances and grudges, and you see a more complex social dynamic all around. I love playing with a full house of players. The game will take longer, though, so be prepared. <br/><br/>I've played with complete newbies a few times, and they always seems to handle really well. Since the rules are so simple, they can focus more on the story-telling aspects. Newbies tend not to have any problem creating narratives, it's keeping track of rules that seem to get them IME. <br/><br/>That said, Newbies either have one of two reactions---either they freeze up and don't do much, or they become over-zealous and try and narrate everything. I HATE having to say, "no, you can't say that..." but rules are rules. I've seen more of the latter than the former. Overall, though, I've haven't had any trouble with non-gamers playing the game. You'll have plenty of questions about what's appropriate for different degrees of success, but the questions will probably come from everyone, not just the newbies.                        </div>

                            Six players and me, for a total of seven people at the table. I run most of my games with 3 or 4 (my optimum number) but I've run large groups like this back in the day and it's no sweat.<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep an eye out for our newbie's reaction. The crew is a supportive bunch and I'm sure they'll all help her out and make her feel comfortable.<br/>

I've got questions re: conflict resolution and I'm trying to read through as many threads on the subject as I can to get my head around it. I'll post again when I think I've got it.                        </div>

                            It might help to run through an "initiation conflict" with her, maybe pre-game, so she can get a feel for the parameters of the system before being thrown to the gamer-wolves.  Maybe ask her what she's most looking forward to and most worried about, and address that.  Just a thought.                        </div>

                            Jason, the issue with that is that the meat of the system is in cooperation and betrayal. You can't do that alone.<br/>
<br/>
Mike, this sounds great. I look forward to reading about the outcome.                        </div>

                            I think that if I can simply show her the basic resolution mechanic (which is really easy anyway) she'll be able to pick up the rest of it in play. Thanks for the tips! :-)<br/>
<br/>
OK, next question: combat. Is this the way to do it?<br/>
<br/>
Example - Juzo, a ronin, and a ghost ninja (an Able opponent) square off. The ghost ninja wants to kill the ronin, and the ronin wants to destroy the ninja. The ronin rolls a 2 and the ninja gets a 6, a Critical Success (a Permanent wound on the ronin). This is narrated by me (the GM) as several moments of flashing blades with the ninja finally somesaulting into the air over the ronin and giving him a deep bloody slash across his back when he lands.<br/>
<br/>
We go around again. This time, Goro, Juzo's partner, kicks in with a point of Trust, indicating that he's attacking the ninja from the flank. Again, Juzo's intent is to destroy the ninja, and the ninja wants to cut Juzo's head off. The ninja gets a 3 and now with 2 dice, Juzo gets an 8, - 1 for the permanent wound, = 7, a Critical Success. The player narrates this as the ninja is distracted momentarily by Goro's attack and Juzo uses the opening to split the ninja from gut to gullet.<br/>
<br/>
Right?                        </div>

                            Well, we had our first session of tMW today and it went swimmingly, I'm happy to report. Only managed to get through chargen and Act 1 but it played itself out quite naturally and we ended on a high note and a good beat.<br/>
<br/>
The characters are:<br/>
Gorobei (Jay) - A young and superstitious man with a likable face, thrown out of his clan for incompetence. He wants the gold from this mission so he can retire to a life of luxury. The tattoo of Buddha on his chest whispers truths to him, He keeps a vial of liquid (as yet unidentified in his belt).<br/>
Shingen (Cam) - A man who can see spirits, and attracts them to him as well. This curse brought shame upon his house and thus he was cast out. By taking this mission he hopes to be able to pay someone to remove the curse. His iron cast liver keeps him drinking all night while he composes poetry.<br/>
Juzo (Ryan) - A proud man whose clan has fallen on hard times. His fiefdom bankrupt, he was cut loose from the clan. He seeks to restore his family to honor with the money from this mission. He keeps a number of weaposn secreted about his person, as well as a shakuhachi. In time of need he can use his prodigious leap to avoid harm.<br/>
Kentaro (Refik) - Grim faced and dour, he failed to protect his lord from their enemies and was made masterless. With the money he hopes to help his dead lord's daughter regain her fiefdom. He has a nose for danger and can improvise weapons in a pinch. The silver locket around his neck speaks to something he lost long ago.<br/>
O-iro (Jenny) - Oiro dressed as a boy in order to train as a man. But when she fell in love with her sensei she was discovered and cast out. If she can, she wants to return with the money and show her clan that she is easily their equal. In her travels she has learned she is lucky at games of chance, and has an uncanny accuracy with thrown stones.<br/>
<br/>
We spent our first hour or so doing chargen and a quick rundown of the rules. The thing that took people the most time was deciding on their special abilities. Some of them were dicussed together, with myself and the other players making suggestions. This went pretty well and some good ideas were made better after a bit of discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I had 5 players (one guy had to go on a business trip and couldn't make it). Jenny was new to roleplaying - she'd never played anything before. The other guys were all crusty old gaming grognards but everyone was very helpful to Jen and at the same time allowed her to find her own feet. She did really well.<br/>
<br/>
We opened with the characters approaching the outskirts of the Aokigahara-jukai, the spirit and ghost filled forest that surounds the base of Mt. Fuji. Traditionally this forest is thought to be haunted (really) with the spirits of people who went in there to commit suicide, or the ghosts of murder victims whose bodies have been disposed of there. It's also notoriously easy to get lost, and as the region is volcanic, pockets of poisonous gas also pose considerable obstacle. The characters' travel through the forest was to be Act 1.<br/>
<br/>
I'd prepped several bangs for this part, and used all of them by the time we wrappd for the day. Two of the grognard players were a bit hesitant at first - they were unfamiliar with having so much player power in their hands. However, I'd invited them to this game because I thought that once they twigged to this they would run with it, and I was right.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout Act 1, I reminded everyone of what they could do with Trust points, and reiterated the idea that it was their responsibility to begin to foreshadow their Fates. I think they all did this really well actually, giving hints of the Fates they'd drawn but not giving too much away yet. Since the cards were drawn secretly, I didn't know what fates they had either and this made it interesting for me as well.<br/>
<br/>
I gotta run but I'll try to post some notes about how Act 1 played out later. We're all lookoing forward to the next session!                        </div>

                            I'm glad to hear it went so well!  Jenny's character sounds fantastic - I can think of a zillion ways to bring her past into the game!  I second Andy's request for more info on her experience.                        </div>

                            Jen was a bit hesitant at first, but as she is already a big genre TV and film buff, I knew she would take to it fairly easily. tMW's system is so simple it hardly proved to be any sort of speed bump at all (for anyone). I think, in fact, it was a bit easier for Jen  to grasp the idea of conflict resolution than it was for my grognards (she had no "gamer baggage" to un-learn, as it were).<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, she said she enjoyed it and we all congratulated her on a successful first game. She is also keen to continue and see what happens next, and this makes me very happy - it's been years and years since I brought a newbie into the fold! :-)<br/>

The actual play writeup is getting pretty large - should I post here in this thread or start another one?                        </div>
