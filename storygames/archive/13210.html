I'm sure I have an old wordpress hanging around here somewhere. Oh, and you can enjoy some pictures of fall trees while you're at it. <br/><br/>Also, please forgive the formatting problems. I composed the damn thing in notepad, and then moving it between here, Word to grammar and spellcheck it, and then into wordpress was too much for it. <br/><br/><a href="http://soundtracktothevoid.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/fiasco-a-gorilla-a-hot-tub-and-a-half-ton-of-meth-on-the-ice/" rel="nofollow">http://soundtracktothevoid.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/fiasco-a-gorilla-a-hot-tub-and-a-half-ton-of-meth-on-the-ice/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297341/#Comment_297341" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T06:55:30+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  6:55AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2010 6:56AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like how you guys got around to the inevitable action figure-meets-gorilla scene. Very nice.\n<blockquote>I think the only issue we had with the actual game play was tilt. We weren\u2019t exceptionally sure if we were rolling the white and black dice separately, or doing the dice math in the book</blockquote>\nIt is the same procedure as the Aftermath - roll all the dice, total colors separately, then subtract the low total from the high total. So if you have two black and two white dice, you roll them to get totals (2+4=6 white, 1+3=4 black) then subtract totals (6 white - 4 black = a final score of 2 white).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kraken" title="Kraken"><img alt="Kraken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kraken">Kraken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297578/#Comment_297578" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T06:39:12+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  6:39AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got it.
