There's no other way to become a real human being. And that insight may pave the road for some interesting perspectives ...<br/><br/>What if verbal role-playing games is growing into a position where they may connect to this truth; that people need each other to become human, and that rpgs are a great way of exploring and developing our humanity.<br/><br/>I believe we have reasons to be patient about this. If we continue to develop verbal role-playing into increasingly subtle/strong/effective games and methods, I expect our kind of games to grow in importance. It will be interesting to see how new ways of connecting to humanity will evolve, in role-playing games, in the future.<br/><br/>We have some pretty strong games today. <br/>And it's only the beginning ...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/benhamill" title="benhamill"><img alt="benhamill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/benhamill">benhamill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415501/#Comment_415501" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T22:43:39+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 10:43PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe this is a noob question, but can you define what you mean by "verbal" in this context?

Still fun, of course, but the potential is less.<br/><br/>There are obvious reasons why the potential of screen based verbal interaction is less than that of real face-to-face interaction. You need to understand that human beings communicate in lots of subtle ways, when physically present to each other. That is part of the "magic" of role-playing games.<br/><br/>By recognizing the strength of these "subtle communications", you may tap into the real power of what you do by the table, when engaging in a game of role-playing. These communications are so intuitive we all do it, whenever we meet someone and talk to them, as we do in role-playing games. But we may also do it as <b>a conscious part</b> of a role-playing game. The method for making these subtle communications a conscious part of your game-play is deceptively simple; eye-contact, shaking hands, affirmative words and touching, smiling, opening your heart, emanating peacefulness ...<br/>- every normal thing you do to strengthen the emotional field between you and another human being.<br/><br/>And these are but a small facet of what verbal role-playing let us play at, with each other. The strength and versatility of our interactions are almost endless, as we really engage and make use of the whole human being (from the deeper sensual, through the wider social and into the higher spiritual layers), when playing our games. <br/><br/>I firmly believe that we, as designers, may tap into these things more and more, making them powerful parts of our new methods. We are already doing it, in the best of our new games. As we continue to develop this form, and reveal the true strength of it in our methods, the verbal role-playing games will grow in potential and importance. <br/><br/>Humans are suckers for effective means of strengthening themselves, and our games will do that like no other games* (or other form of art) will ever do.<br/><br/>:-)<br/><br/>* With one exception; Live Action role-playing games does it too. LARP is closely related to RPGs, and have the same psycho-social potential.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415584/#Comment_415584" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T05:25:22+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  5:25AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll throw out a friendly counter point, one of my gaming friends is blind.

Perhaps I'm trading subtlety for quantity, but I'm not complaining.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415588/#Comment_415588" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T06:41:51+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  6:41AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kind of like how my kindle has increased the number of books I've read in the last six months.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415594/#Comment_415594" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T07:52:57+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  7:52AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Current trends seldom come out as the future. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></blockquote>\nWait, wouldn't that mean that past trends are just as unlikely to come out as the future? They were yesterday's current trends, after all... :-)<br/><br/>Seriously, though, I think it's obvious that face-to-face RPGs aren't going to overtake online RPGs in market share anytime soon for simple reasons of convenience for consumers, the amount of money to be made by publishers/studios, and lingering stereotypes limiting the audience. (Video games get around this stereotype to some extent because they don't resemble a children's game of "let's play pretend" as much, and their audience is so broad nowadays that it's seen as a more "normal" activity.)<br/><br/>I do think that the audience for face-to-face RPGs has the potential to expand in the near future (and I wouldn't mind if it did, as it'd be nice to have more people I could play with). The normalization of RPG, fantasy, and science-fiction trappings in bigger-budget media (video games and film) can play a part in that by at least helping mitigate stereotypes limiting growth. And actually, digital media have done a lot to make it easier to nurture this hobby, giving a space to keep discussion alive between all-too-infrequent game nights and fan conventions. (Think about what you're doing right now, on this forum...)<br/><br/>Still, as nice as it is to hope that we'll to return to some golden age of oral communication, people have been saying that for many, many years \u2013 after the telephone, film, television, and hell, even the printed word. Face-to-face communication will always be important to us as humans, and technology will both help enable it and get in the way. The "trend" toward mediated communication isn't just a short-term fad, though. <br/><br/>(Yikes, can you tell that I'm a former Communication professor?

Traditional games are good at providing us (super)heroes of great power. But where, Spidey, is the great responsibility. Kill and loot. Where's the consequences? What matter if you lose hit points - but lose a bond of friendship, a relationship, risk humiliation, - these are things that are being put in the mechanics of games. I was (still am) a little leery of JEEPform; but in this context - exploring what it is to be human - it begins to make more sense.<br/><br/>One note on technology : (JasonT will know more about this) the concept of the Global Village. Imagine being able to play not only across borders and cultures but across language barriers!

I'd love to dream with you about a magical, hopeful future where lots more people play a ton of RPGs in a variety of different ways, but I'm not even sure of what we're discussing anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_415734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415734/#Comment_415734" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T10:51:01+00:00" title="June  8, 2013 10:51AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2013 10:52AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason; I see your confusion. In spite of the title of this thread, I do not aim at discussing trends vs trends. I aim at discussing the potential of verbal RPGs. Ok?<br/><br/>What I propose for you, JasonT (and others), is that you try to recognize that verbal RPGs in its original form are in fact taking place face-to-face, and that the "interface" of faces is essential to the potential of the form, even today. Even more so today, in an increasingly technological world (but please; I'm NOT interested in a tech-debate :-). <br/><br/>I see potential for growth in RPGs. I see a huge potential for growth in the type of RPGs that takes place face-to-face, in verbal and physical interaction. The fact that we influence each other the most in such natural interactions, using our senses (which are many) to experience each other in full, is at the hearth of this matter. <br/><br/>RPGs may help us to conduct our interactions in methodical forms that takes us to totally new places, while playing unfamiliar characters. And that is exiting! It may increase our experience of human conditions, and what it may include to be a human being. <br/><br/>Ultimately it may help us develop the human race.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415737/#Comment_415737" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T11:52:41+00:00" title="June  8, 2013 11:52AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2013 11:53AM by JasonT.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Jason; I see your confusion.

Most of history has not enjoyed the massive quantity of entertainment media we do, and as a consequence, people entertained themselves: they sang, and danced, and played instruments, and performed plays, not for a paying public, but for their friends, families, neighbours and acquaintances.  And convenience isn't the only reason that we largely no longer do that; it's also the case that amateur productions of this kind struggle to compete with professionally produced entertainment that is available at the click of a mouse.<br/><br/>I think the draw for a lot of people is the opportunity to be personally creative in that way, with an audience whose responses are more personally meaningful than simply a commercial transaction.  To be able to do something of your own, rather than to passively consume the creations of others.  Even, to enjoy the shared sense of purpose that prior eras might have gained from a barn raising or some other sort of collective endeavour.  And RPG is very well suited to all of this, because it's accessible, and basically easy, and requires little in the way of tools or long periods of training (to paint or play an instrument, say)<br/><br/>So I agree with Thomas that there is indeed a credible possibility that RPG could become a major, widely recognised, cultural art form in some future society.  That society would have to be somewhat different from ours, in that we seldom live near our friends and family, and working hours are tending to lengthen, which again provides motivation to just flip on the TV rather than get together with people to play a game.  But it would be possible to solve those problems, and then yes perhaps RPG could become pretty widespread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415960/#Comment_415960" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T04:10:09+00:00" title="June 11, 2013  4:10AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Seriously; we now very little of what the future brings, but we know one thing; people need to relate to each other.

To be able to know yourself you need to discover the relations to other humans.<br/><br/>To be able to make roleplaying games take a bigger part in everyday life, it need to change. Improvisation, and roleplaying games, are about rediscover spontaneity - to start using your imagination again - instead of censoring yourself in fear of telling to much of you and your inner thoughts. Roleplaying games, and improvisation, are about being more aware about the people around you and accepting their ideas while offering yours. About communication with your fellow humans.<br/><br/><b>As a casual game</b>,  played with your friends, roleplaying games need to be more available. It should be easy to pick up a game and play it while learning it.<br/><br/><b>As a radio show</b>, the removal of props have to be necessary so you don't have to say things like "Patricia is rolling the dice and they show 12". These things can instead be replace by the use of phrases, and it's an advantage if they can be understood just by hearing someone else using them.<br/><br/><b>As a TV show</b>, you can take a look at LARP.

To have, say, 70% of the world population playing verbal games, you'd need games that:<br/>- Are free.<br/>- Have really simple rules<br/>- Require less conditions to be enjoyed (like players already familiar with the system, a quiet place and a table, an specific attitude towards roleplaying, GM prep, players who enjoy mental activity more than phisical activity, etc)<br/>- Have no need for props or perhaps just one, and better if players can make it themselves.<br/>- Take little time but can be extended as long as players want withouth repeating itself.<br/>- Produce content almost by itself instead of relying heavily in the players to provide it.<br/><br/>And the greatest PR campaign on the whole history of humankind. Then you could make them trendy and have them change society in a substantial way. Sounds more possible now? Less? Well, games could certaily improve if us designers weren't also following the path of less resistance (ok, not that all of us do, I'm particularily interested in developing games with the conditions quoted above and probably most people in SG too). We need to roll a 7-9 in weird+cool and play it unsafe from there.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_415992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415992/#Comment_415992" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T11:10:59+00:00" title="June 11, 2013 11:10AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As said: <br/>"Those who say it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it." <br/>- Chinese proverb<br/><br/>You seem to have little faith in RPGs, "WarriorMonk", and perhaps little faith in humans too.

To be able to do something of your own, rather than to passively consume the creations of others. </blockquote>As said; this is great stuff, C! Pardon me for being a bit slow in answering it properly! Have had much to do professionally, ending my seven RPG-campaigns for the season these days.<br/><br/>There are two really important points here, that I want to address;<br/><br/><b>1) Being personally creative;</b> expressing yourself is a great way of learning, and developing yourself. As our games grows steadily more refined in method, and nuanced in themes, the opportunity for personal growth by playing RPGs increases. I've seen this in play amongst my hundreds of young players through the years, and I've seen it in play within the broader Nordic community for LARP/RPGs; players and designers of role-playing games develop admirable social, mental and moral skills; their great developments sets them apart, in positive ways.<br/><br/><b>2) Engaging friends and family;</b> it is highly meaningful for groups of friends and family to take part in meaningful interactions, producing fiction that challenge our ethics, and help us refine them: <br/>- in fictional conflicts; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">speculation -&gt; action -&gt; reaction -&gt; solution -&gt; consequence</span><br/>To be an active participant in such an ethical praxis, is laden with large benefits, both in the short and long term perspective:<br/>- We enjoy it as a game. <br/>- We grow closer as a group.<br/>- Each one of us strengthen our identity.<br/><br/>The ethical praxis of RPGs makes us more sure of our place in society; it helps us develop the ethical apparatus necessary to function well in society. High ethics is a way of experiencing our life as meaningful. We grow more easily into a positive identity by playing RPGs.\n<blockquote>Even, to enjoy the shared sense of purpose that prior eras might have gained from a barn raising or some other sort of collective endeavour. </blockquote><i>A shared sense of purpose</i> is a beautiful way of putting it, contracycle! <br/><br/>Sitting down and engaging in a game of pretend, as adults, is really a step back in time, to the shared stories of the campfire, where the world and our life in it is laid out, explained, and lifted to the higher realm of truth/history/legend/myth.<br/><br/>A beautiful and important thing to do.\n<blockquote>And RPG is very well suited to all of this, because it's accessible, and basically easy, and requires little in the way of tools or long periods of training (to paint or play an instrument, say)</blockquote>JA! You are so right! This becomes increasingly more true as our games grown simpler and more refined, making it ever easier to use them, and for us to rise with them to the high realms of fiction where we go into <i>flow</i>; the state where we are able to give ourselves over to the magic of being someone else, to let the characters take over and play us.<br/><br/>To reach <i>flow</i> in RPGs is a spiritual experience; a liberating state of trance. A chance to connect with your higher self, your soul!\n<blockquote>Improvisation, and roleplaying games, are about rediscover spontaneity - to start using your imagination again - instead of censoring yourself in fear of telling to much of you and your inner thoughts. </blockquote>Oh yes! <br/><br/>As humans we are very much dependent of our imagination. We hear much talk about emotions and intelligence; <i>imagination</i> is as important! It is the key to empathy, and the key to solid assessments of consequences; you need imagination to understand how an action may engage other humans, and make them respond.<br/><br/>And; the ability to engage in positive interactions, in trusting open-mindedness, is of great value to us, both as individuals and as a fellowship. It helps us develop a positive understanding of who we are and how we work in relation to others. \n<blockquote>Roleplaying games, and improvisation, are about being more aware about the people around you and accepting their ideas while offering yours. About communication with your fellow humans.</blockquote>Of course!<br/><br/>The beautiful co-play of a role-playing game done right, may release your personality from the anxiety of loneliness and uncertainty ...<br/>- and by that enable you to bend your will to the will of others, without loosing faith in your own abilities. It will help you to a better understanding of the nature and necessity of "give and take" in social interactions. You will be closer to a general acceptance of yourself as an integral part of the social interaction. That may open your personality to the reverberating YES which is the core of all great minds.<br/><br/>Thanks for giving such beautiful contributions to this thread, contracycle and Rickard! I hope your contributions will inspire others to respond in kind! <br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416276/#Comment_416276" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T09:10:14+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  9:10AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You misunderstood me, Thomas. I do have a lot of faith in humankind and RPGs, and I share your views in the previous post. Yes, I agree with all the positive consequences and I think they are achievable. It's just that I'm discussing one step ahead into the solution for reaching that, a project I'm working on right now. You see, all this project is about, is exactly about introducing RPGs to my country, Peru. It's a place without a tradition of roleplaying games. So the points I mentioned in my post earlier are meant to be used as a way to reach a public interest up to the level of soccer, the national sport here. Verbal games ARE the future, but the traditional ones won't do. Indie games are on the right way, but there's still a few barriers we've to get through. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_416309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416309/#Comment_416309" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T14:45:15+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  2:45PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paulo; sorry I misunderstood you! I appreciate your special situation. Keep at it!<br/><br/>You should really get to know some of the games currently designed in the Nordic countries. <br/><br/>Start by trying out the splendid game "Until We Sink", a game that invents a deceptively simple method for intuitive role-playing. It has been inspiration for a lot of Norwegian design since it was conceived. <br/><br/>And then you may take a sniff of the Swedish Jeep-ideas, and the Danish scenario-tradition growing up around the Fastaval rpg-convention.<br/><br/>And take a trip over here, for the ambulating larp/rpg-gathering <i>Knutepunkt</i> (it will be held in -Denmark next year).
