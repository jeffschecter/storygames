It does involve spheres, cubes, and water. It's called Spillover, and it's for 2-6 players ages 4 and up.<br/><br/>Spillover is just a set of rules, with blocks. The blocks are of varying size and color. The colors are coded to volume: Red the smallest, all the way through purple the largest. The blocks come in different shapes: spheres, cubes, pyramids, twelve-sided shape (whatever that's called) etc. Volume is constant over color, so the purple sphere has the same volume as the purple cube.<br/><br/>Play outside. The youngest player takes the spheres, the next youngest takes the pyramids, next the cubes, and so on.<br/><br/>Take a stock pot and fill it 3/4 full with water. Starting with the player of the sphere, and moving up in the number of sides, players add one of their pieces to the water. You can drop it in, or you can put your hand in and set it in.<br/><br/>If water spills over the top of the pot: even a drop! the game ends. Whoever spilt the water is disqualified from winning. Other players are scored based on the size of their pieces placed (probably the smallest being worth 2, the next 3, and so on until purple is seven.) Highest score wins.<br/><br/>The goal is a light-hearted summer brinksmanship game that you can play at a picnic.<br/><br/>It's possible it resolves into an easy winner. In which case, uh, I'll think of something else.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>P.S. In case it isn't clear, it's okay to have pieces sticking out of the water if you can manage it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144434/#Comment_144434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T10:35:08+00:00" title="May 16, 2008 10:35AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>twelve-sided shape (whatever that's called)</blockquote>\nDuodecahedron, I believe.<br/><br/>*Seth puts away his nerd powerz.*<br/><br/>And, actually, Ben, this seems like it could be a lot of fun!<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144445/#Comment_144445" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T10:59:45+00:00" title="May 16, 2008 10:59AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey,<br/><br/>three things, this seems like a lot of fun on a hot summer day.

It's less likely to resolve to easy wins (or forced losses) because pyramids are hollow and so it's possible to nest them, making it rather hard to "trap" your opponent with an unavoidable loss.<br/>---------<br/>But RE: Spillover as written:<br/><br/>You can make it an RPG trivially: require each player to narrate how the polygon FEELS about its impending immersion, using no more words than the number of sides on the solid. You have to remove the association of shapes to ages, to make this interesting and challenging; but that rule was ageist and would make for flat play anyway--no challenge or decision-making about the shape to drop. As should be obvious, if you drop a sphere, you may only say a one-word expletive.<br/><br/>I'd remove the "you can put your hand in and set it" rule, though--for one thing, that's going to steadily reduce the amount of water in the pot, as some will stick to the players' hands. In fact, the "even a drop" rule would be violated... hmmm, so maybe it's self-correcting?<br/><br/>But that rule DEFINITELY favors players who do not suffer from DTs or palsy; and you wouldn't want to be perceived as an able-ist, would you?<br/><br/>And for clarification: some portion of the polygon must be immersed, yes? Otherwise, folks will try to stack up and out of the pot. (Feature, not flaw, maybe? If you knock over a stack, odds are good some water will splash.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144868/#Comment_144868" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T10:52:15+00:00" title="May 19, 2008 10:52AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;i&gt;some portion of the polygon must be immersed, yes?
