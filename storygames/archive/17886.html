Given that its core mechanic doesn't depend on any specific type of die (other than that you need lots of them!), a thought occurs: why not use playing cards or minor arcana instead? The overall tone of the game seems to lend itself more to card iconography than dice, at least to me.<br/><br/>I was thinking of a simple deck with, say, a single joker included either in the centre of the deck or four from the bottom (to ensure some open endedness). Is there any reason why this is a terrible idea?<br/><br/>[EDIT - I should have explained that the joker tells the players it is time to shuffle the deck, otherwise card counting renders the system very predictable. It could confer additional factors such as counting as a 0 or 14, but that's another matter.]<br/><br/>(I was thinking of ways you could incorporate the major arcana but that feels like quite a major rules hack).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404725/#Comment_404725" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-27T03:13:18+00:00" title="January 27, 2013  3:13AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This can be cool with a nice tarot deck, but isn't it a bit slow?

It's possible this could be seen as a feature, but I bet it will mess with the Sorcerer mechanics. That game is so tightly tuned that it might have unforeseen effects.<br/><br/>I wonder if there's any more-dice like but more thematic randomizers.

But that was why I was suggesting including a "shuffle" card in the middle or near the bottom of the deck, to prevent it from becoming entirely predictable. While obviously a completely different game, I personally much prefer playing <i>Settlers of Catan</i> with a deck of cards (available at your FLGS) over dice because of that semi-closed arc of probability.<br/><br/>In terms of a game like Sorcerer, I quite like the idea of drawing a load of high value cards early on, and knowing that there's no chance of them reappearing again for the next few turns. Plus, because the system compares scores with scores - as opposed to a target number - I would have thought it would all balance out even if all the high or low cards were drawn early.<br/><br/>I'm not sure the Sorcerer rules are so tightly tuned that such an approach would break the game - otherwise the rulebook wouldn't be so cool with you using whatever die type you prefer, surely? But if there's a core mechanic it would conflict with that I've missed, then that would be a different story.<br/><br/>Unless anyone has already tried it and can speak from experience, I supposed I should just give it a go!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404787/#Comment_404787" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-27T19:29:53+00:00" title="January 27, 2013  7:29PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It wouldn't break the game and be unplayable, but the idea of your dice coming up badly and things going horribly for you at totally arbitrary times seems like an intentional part of the game to me.

The math is difficult, but I estimate that this won't have a noticeable influence except in some weird borderline situations.<br/><br/>I don't see any major reason not to use cards. I wouldn't like them myself for Sorcerer for aesthetic reasons (that dicing system is beautiful), but that's just an opinion.<br/><br/>I would suggest dropping the Joker and just shuffling the deck after every conflict. That's an entirely natural process for play, and something I would expect in a cards-using conflict resolution system. There is no advantage to leaving the cards out when you could be fiddling with them while playing. And there particularly is no advantage to having the Joker come up in the middle of drawing, necessitating a shuffling interruption that could have just as easily been done in the time since the last conflict.<br/><br/>One thing you might like to do if using cards is to make the follow-up bonus dice more concrete. Sorcerer normally says that players can get bonus dice from prior support rolls, or fictional checks that have built momentum for their character: three successes in the last roll means three bonus dice for the next one, so on. You could switch this up with cards a bit: after a conflict let the player draw their success in cards, then pick the best one and discard the rest. Then in the next relevant conflict they can add that extra card into their draw. A slightly different way to do things, and perhaps a bit more flavourful if you're using cards anyway.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404792/#Comment_404792" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-27T20:58:46+00:00" title="January 27, 2013  8:58PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not just use the best winning card from the current draw, or something like that?<br/><br/>(In any case, you'd have to work out the probabilities, of course.

That said, deal X cards versus Y cards and compare isn't that much slower than roll X pool versus Y pool and compare the highest -- I did this w/ Universalis a few times in lieu of d10's and it worked just fine with typical cards.<br/><br/>Hell, you could even use the major arcana if you wanted it to be really screwy, especially if you have a deck that labels them numerically (unless everyone playing can remember their order off the top of their head easily, I sure can't.)<br/><br/>The benefit this would get you is in the resolution -- even without any knowledge of tarot, you can use the picture on the card in order to help narrate how the conflict was resolved.  This could honestly be really cool... sometimes.  Other times, you'd be trying to narrate out why you just shot someone after drawing the Lovers card.  Ok, bad example, that one is fairly easy!  Especially if you have people with interest in tarot, this could be pretty cool.  <br/><br/>Normal deck of cards w/ a joker would work fine, and would add in a trump "gotcha!" moment... which could be kinda cool, it's essentially rolling a critical 1/53 times.  Just do what Savage Worlds does, and shuffle as soon as the Joker is drawn.<br/><br/>And to echo the above -- cards slow down Savage Worlds?  They're a nice and quick little initiative tracker.<br/><br/>Anyway, just from my experience w/ WFRP3, having the dice (or cards in this case) offer you some advice on how the action was resolved (e.g. how many boons vs. successes) can lead to some neat constraints that can lead to some fun creativity in narrating results.  <br/><br/>Try it and let us know how it goes please!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405811/#Comment_405811" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-09T15:51:24+00:00" title="February  9, 2013  3:51PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a partially related note, James Wallis' Alas Vegas, currently on Kickstarter, uses Tarot as the basis of its core mechanic.
