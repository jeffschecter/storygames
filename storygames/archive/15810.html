It doesn't really matter, though if your memory of my SG participation goes back that far you may recall a few posts I made that echo points I'm going to discuss now.  I'd dig up the links (or try to), but I think the gist will get across here.<br/><br/>Anyway, I should start out by saying that I haven't played in a face-to-face roleplaying session since late 2000/early 2001.  I played like a maniac in my teens and early 20s, often to the exclusion of other social interactions, so I have an extensive background in the hobby.  My most recent roleplaying experience of any sort was the winter of 2010 during Snowmageddon, when <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/account.php?u=632" rel="nofollow">Benhimself</a> ran playtest sessions of <i>Apocalypse World</i> over IRC in the channel, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11452" rel="nofollow"><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a></a>.<br/><br/>I try to keep my toe in by checking out various and sundry new games as they appear and make a splash, but there's one thing I started noticing back during that <i>Apocalypse World</i> game: I don't really understand roleplaying games anymore.<br/><br/>People keep telling me how well-written the MC sections of <i>Apocalypse World</i> are and I believe them, especially since so many folks are playing and enjoying the game.  Clearly something was done correctly.  But I read them and I feel like I'm being exposed to some kind of alien text, or a heretical document that directly contravenes everything I know (or thought I knew) about roleplaying.  I would come to Story Games during that period and read about things like "emergent gameplay" and couldn't wrap my brain around what that meant in practice.<br/><br/>When I started playing RPGs in the late '70s things were different.  I'm not saying they were <i>better</i>, but there was a very specific dynamic in play: the DM/GM makes up a story or a locale and the players explore it.  If there's a plot, the DM/GM has it all prepped out ahead of time, and while there may be room for improvisation to a certain extent, the path is well marked.  Games were exemplified by tons of development before the first die is rolled.  To put it another way: the GM is god and you are his playthings.  Collaborative storytelling happened by accident, not by design.<br/><br/>That's <i>really</i> not how things work anymore.  Well, maybe they do if you're still playing D&amp;D in its various flavors, but when it comes to what people call "story games," which are what I'm talking about now, the whole paradigm has shifted.  The GM is now a facilitator, not a dictator.  Plot is organically developed through play.  The players themselves bring much of the direction and drama to the table.<br/><br/>I recently read <i>Play Unsafe</i>, which had been recommended to me because of its "story game"-y approach to roleplaying.  The takeaway I got from it was, "Don't do anything you ever did in a game played in the '80s.  In fact, do the opposite, and all will be magically revealed unto you."  So I didn't find it very useful, with apologies to the author.<br/><br/>The thing is, <i>I really want to play these games</i>.  People are obviously having a good time doing things in this new way, but I'm stuck here with a kind of befuddled look on my face trying to comprehend even the bare essentials of this method.  I'm so attached to the way things were done in my formative years that doing them any other way is a total mystery.<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/account.php?u=156" rel="nofollow">Bill White</a> recently encouraged me to come to a gaming convention later this month and join in a playtest of his game, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15754" rel="nofollow">The New World</a>.  I'd love to, but I read his description of how gameplay develops in that game and I think, "I have no idea how to do that."  I would be dead weight at the table, completely paralyzed by my inability to think about roleplaying in any other way besides how I thought of it in the '80s.<br/><br/>The obvious answer would be (to borrow from <i>Apocalypse World</i>): to do it, <i>do it</i>.  However it's hard if you don't have people who are willing to handhold you through the process of completely relearning roleplaying.  It's a total fun-kill for acclimated players, and I don't want to put any group through that.  Plus a lot of you guys own cats, and I'm deathly allergic of cats and can't play at your houses, but that's another problem altogether.<br/><br/>So am I stuck?  Is there some way for me to unlearn on my own and emerge, fully formed, into this new standard?  Or am I condemned to be some group's fun-killer for however long it takes me to get my nu-roleplaying act together?<br/><br/>The title of this entry is a little misleading.  I don't think I've outgrown roleplaying games.  Rather, I think they may have outgrown <i>me</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359061/#Comment_359061" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T11:23:37+00:00" title="February 12, 2012 11:23AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2012 11:24AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I play with people who are role-playing veterans but are new to story games (which sounds like what you're describing), I find they usually have an easier time adjusting to a game that is entirely unlike what they're used to, rather than something that looks like a traditional game on the surface but has wildly different expectations and norms.<br/><br/>If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, you're going to keep thinking it's a duck and all your duck-related reactions are going to kick in.

The world actually is like that, there is no guarantee that even relatively simple things would be possible. For you it might be trying to learn to play a certain game without having anybody to play it with in your immediate social circles; for some other people I know it's things like wanting to have a martial arts hobby but having no instructors in their town, or wanting to travel internationally but not having the time for it. Coincidentally another Sam! I know here in Finland is currently considering abandoning his rpg hobby simply because he's moved to such an inconceivable hellhole of a town that nobody there seems to be willing to form a gaming group with him. There is no certainty that you, I, or anybody else in this world will find happiness in our endeavours.<br/><br/>That being said, I've played a lot of story games with people who've never encountered anything like that, both roleplayers and non-roleplayers, and I can't say that I'd have felt the potential dead weight that difficult. You just need to play a game that can adapt to different players carrying more or less of the weight. This is a virtue in game design in general, there's no guarantee that all players will be equally imaginative, active and sharp at the table. Just tell your prospective group that you know that you'll be pretty passive for the first few sessions, but that you're willing to work on improving, so you should play a game that enables you to participate but doesn't require it for the game to function. Then just play, and ask your group to help out, perhaps, if they're better at it than you are.<br/><br/>Furthermore, can't you be happy playing the types of games you know? Are they not fun for you? I myself am usually not tempted to play types of games where I don't have any natural affinity. For example, I'm quite happy with my hobby without participating in another larp in my life, more or less.<br/><br/>Lastly, I understand that you hesitate to simply play, and would like to understand more about new types of games before trying them out in practice. I can tell you that my own traditional gaming experience fit very well with the Forge discourse in the early years of the last decade; I could understand the theory discussions and appreciate how the game designs from that era built upon various assumptions about roleplaying while discarding others. It seems that the majority of people can't understand those discourses <i>at all</i>, but for me learning to play "story games" was a natural process of reading theory, actual play musings and game texts. You've probably already tried this, but somebody who hasn't might try my method and simply read Sorcerer, Dust Devils, My Life with Master, InSpectres and whatever other games appeal to them alongside all Ron Edwards articles and any Forge forum threads that spark attention from 2003 to 2004. Definitely not a crash course for everybody, but for me it was an effortless route to understanding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359066/#Comment_359066" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T11:41:12+00:00" title="February 12, 2012 11:41AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, also, I should recommend some games that are particularly well-suited to having possible dead-weight players. My experience is that games like <i>Burning Wheel</i> or <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> or others with a vaguely traditional set-up are useful in this regard, as they have such a free framework that it's not difficult for the more passive players to voluntarily play companion characters to the real protagonists. As long as the group can build creative accord between the GM and one of the players, this type of game will run well and drag the other players along. The players who actually get their creative agenda on the table will be on the spot for the most of the time, while the more passive and uncertain players can observe, participate in secondary ways and look for a natural-feeling opportunity to come to the forefront themselves.<br/><br/><i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is like this as well, nothing much breaks even if one of the players is more passive and doesn't quite grog things, especially if he's willing to listen to cues from the others. On the other hand, games like <i>Dust Devils</i>, <i>Polaris</i> or <i>Mountain Witch</i> are not suitable for these types of situations: they apportion serious influence to the players and requires them to use it, it's going to reduce the enjoyment of the game if there are particularly clueless players participating.<br/><br/>Of course, as Ben says, there's a danger of playing these games "wrong" by bringing in assumptions from superficially similar games. For this reason I'd suggest playing with an experienced GM who knows what he's doing with the particular toolset in question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359069/#Comment_359069" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T11:57:04+00:00" title="February 12, 2012 11:57AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Sam --<br/><br/>I feel you, and in some quarters of the internet (or the hobby) much is made of the distinction between traditional RPGs and "story-games." But I think that from a player perspective there's actually very little difference in what you are trying to do--or, at least, not big enough a difference to make a difference. Ultimately, as a player, your job is still to <i>make your character try to do what you want</i>, or perhaps <i>make your character try to get what he or she wants</i>. You take a chance, and you roll the dice. To me, it feels the same. Sure, the GM's role is a little different--more facilitative, less coercive, as you point out--and from my perspective that produces more satisfying outcomes at the player level, since the game responds to my vision of the character (maybe it validates that vision, or maybe it pushes back against it, but it still responds). But most games still work fine if, as a PC, you imagine what your character would want and try to get it.<br/><br/>Here's <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/TheNewWorldplaytest1" rel="nofollow">actual play (AP) audio</a> of a playtest I just ran of <i>The New World</i> with a group that plays mostly traditional games; we're in the middle of a D&amp;D campaign right now that the DM is running on pretty traditional lines. Some people participate more, some a little less, but they figure it out and seem to be having a good time. And, once the game gets going, playing their characters is pretty much what they do.<br/><br/>The meta-level stuff about setting up the situation that occurs in games like <i>The New World</i> doesn't sound that different to me than pre-game "what sort of campaign do we want this time?" discussion that takes place in some traditional groups. Granted, there may be more frequent shuttling back and forth from the character's-eye view to the meta-level, but it is just that: a shuttling. There are moments when what you are doing is pure role-playing: imagining the situation from the perspective of the character and describing an action or reaction that makes sense in that context.<br/><br/>The difficult moments that you are afraid of can happen, but I don't think they should be a deal-breaker, like the "cat in the adage"--as Hamlet said self-reflectively--who let "I would" wait upon "I dare not." I remember a moment like that happening to my brother the first time he played <i>With Great Power</i>. But he just left the table for a few moments, got his mind right, and came back to play. Easy.<br/><br/>To sum up: (1) not that different; (2) differences possible to manage; and (3) hippie gamers love everybody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359071/#Comment_359071" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T12:11:39+00:00" title="February 12, 2012 12:11PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not just stick with more "traditional" games?

The style offered them nothing they wanted, my shift in tone and focus felt like a betrayal, and we all agreed we wanted different things from the experience. One of them dubbed my first try of Burning Empires "the death of fun." I don't know that that experience is unavoidable. No idea how you'd keep that from happening if you're in a group of people who aren't all you, or who aren't all on the same page with your agenda.<br/><br/>OTOH, a couple of the doubters got sick to death of hearing how owsum our nu-skool sessions were (we do a mix of boardgames and RPG sessions). I had also learned a lot lot lot along the way from playing a couple dozen of the other new little games (Dust Devils, Inspectres, Lacuna, WGP, DitV, etc) so I was also better at leveraging all the good parts. So those guys gave the experience another shot and it worked out great for them and me.<br/><br/>What is it about this style of play that's most attractive to you? What's the aesthetic? Maybe if you can explain what you're aiming for, it'll be easier for you to find it and it'll be easier to build that expectation into your players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pjack" title="Pjack"><img alt="Pjack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pjack">Pjack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359076/#Comment_359076" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T12:40:43+00:00" title="February 12, 2012 12:40PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sam! I'm not in your situation, but I've had analogous experiences when playing different kinds of story games. Here's some advice that would be really useful if you were me. I'm not sure how much of it will actually be helpful to you, but in some weird parallel universe where you are me, then this might actually be good advice.<br/><br/><b>0.) There's nothing wrong with "traditional" GM/Player games!</b> There are a gazillion of them out there. Play with friends. Have fun!<br/><br/><b>1.) Oh man you are totally overthinking this.</b> I bet your head is swimming with story game jargon about 'engaging the fiction' and 'shared narratives' and 'division of GM responsibilities'. Forget all that crap. All you have to do to play story games with friends is to be a little more willing to jump in and riff on what's going on. I bet that you used to do this <i>all the time</i> when you played RPGs, without even thinking about it. Like in D&amp;D, when one player says, "My character ran away from his apprenticeship with an evil wizard", and you say, "Hey, my character's uncle was an evil wizard; I be they're the same guy!", and the other player says, "Yeah!". Boom! If you really have never done that - and that's fine, lots of people have fun playing RPGs without jumping in and riffing on stuff - then you can totally practice doing it in traditional games before moving on to story games.<br/><br/>Here's the thing that totally blew my mind when I figured it out: In a traditional GM/Player game, you can jump in and riff on <i>what the GM is saying</i>. Like the GM says, "OK, you're in this restaurant in Tokyo," and you say, "Oh man I was actually in this really cool restaurant in Tokyo, it was in this little space under a train trestle, can it be like that?" and the GM says, "OK!", and you describe it. Depending on your play group, you can even skip the part where you ask for permission; just jump in and do it. (Or spend chits, or say the catch phrase, or whatever.) Again, you can practice doing this in traditional games.<br/><br/><b>2.) It's OK to play it "wrong".</b> You don't need to pore over the story game rulebook, trying to memorize every little detail, so that you will have a Correct and Accurate Story Game Experience at the table. A lot of those story game rules about fiddling with dice or cards or beads or whatever are just a pacing mechanic, so your game doesn't run for ten hours. As long as everyone is at the table for the same reason (create an engaging story), and is willing to jump in and riff on things, you're good to go. (I, personally, am <i>really bad at this.</i> I always obsess about the rules. Note to self: unclench, sit down, have fun.)<br/><br/><b>3.) The goal of a story game is to create an engaging story.</b> Well, duh. But it can be hard, when you're actually playing at the table, to stop thinking about how your character can succeed and/or survive, and start thinking about how you can make your character's <i>story</i> awesome. It's extra hard to remember to look around at the other players, and think up ways you can help make <i>their</i> character's stories awesome. But seriously, this gets easier with practice. It all comes back to jumping in and riffing on what's going on. Once you start thinking about how you can riff on things to make a better story, it gets easier to remember to do it in the future.<br/><br/><b>4.) You can totally mix Primetime Adventures with traditional games.</b> Every so often, when there's a break in the action &amp; you want to get into some deeper character moments, slip a session of PTA into your traditional game. Have everyone make PTA versions of their characters, and do a session as though your game were a television drama. My friend did this with his Star Wars game, and it worked great. (Although it was hard to find a good Issue for my Jedi. "Maybe I'm <i>Too</i> Awesome" just didn't cut it. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> )<br/><br/><b>5.) Just because a game is well-designed doesn't mean it's going to be fun for you to play.</b> Like, I'm still blown away by how well designed 4th Edition D&amp;D is. On paper, it's a great game. At the table, though, it just doesn't do what I want it to do. I bet the same is true of lots and lots of story games. When you read about how excited people are about a game, remember that a.)

People keep telling me how well-written the MC sections of<i>Apocalypse World</i>are and I believe them, especially since so many folks are playing and enjoying the game.</blockquote>\nSam--<br/><br/>I don't think that Apocalypse World is the perfect rules text (IMO Fiasco and Microscope are the current state of the art in text lucidity) and I don't think that playing over a low-bandwidth IRC connection is the optimal way to learn a game.  It certainly wouldn't be for me.  I need to have people model a game for me in real life before I can really get it.  <br/><br/>I've been playing story games like a maniac for the past few years and I very rarely learn a game from its text.  If I'm interested in a game, I usually seek out someone who knows the game well already and learn from them.  Story games, for me, are all about the things that are created collaboratively that none of the individuals at the table could have created alone.  So they're impossible for me to understand in a vacuum.<br/><br/>Think about how you learned to play RPGs back in the day: did you learn from reading the text in isolation or did you learn from other people?  All that stuff about how the GM makes the world and the plot and the characters adhere to it -- that didn't arise strictly out of texts.  <br/><br/>So if I were in your shoes I'd follow your own advice: <b>If you want to play these games, go and play them.</b>  You don't need to find a regular group.  Go to a convention.  Try lots of stuff.  Explain that you're new at this to anyone you play with.  I bet the vast majority will understand and help you along.  There are lots of great game teachers out there who are eager to share their favorite game with you.  When you're prompted to say something, go with the most obvious thing in your head.  Don't worry about making beauty and art and novelty and originality; just contribute.  Some of it won't be fun, but some of it might be! <br/><br/>Also, I know it's very much easier said than done, but try to let go of the idea that you're a surefire funkiller.  That's a self-fulfilling prophecy.  It's a risk to step out of your comfort zone, but it's not a guaranteed disaster.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359090/#Comment_359090" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T14:08:25+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  2:08PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2012 2:10PM by Brian_Minter.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, I got into newer-fangled games* a few years back, and the friends I normally play with aren't always as into the same things.

Find a group who is willing to play new games with you, and follow their lead. I "facilitated" (there's no GM, but I was the one who knew the rules) two games of Fiasco last night. Of the three other players, two of them had only ever played traditional games. It was a smashing success. I just explained the rules, and encouraged them to participate. They caught on pretty fast. <br/><br/>I actually would really recommend Fiasco as an intro game. It can easily deal with people who don't contribute much (it's designed so that you can get pretty far being purely reactive, as long as other people are being proactive).

I'm not in your situation, but I've had analogous experiences when playing different kinds of story games. Here's some advice that would be really useful if you were me. I'm not sure how much of it will actually be helpful to you, but in some weird parallel universe where you are me, then this might actually be good advice.<br/><br/><b>0.) There's nothing wrong with "traditional" GM/Player games!</b>There are a gazillion of them out there. Play with friends. Have fun!<br/><br/><b>1.) Oh man you are totally overthinking this.</b>I bet your head is swimming with story game jargon about 'engaging the fiction' and 'shared narratives' and 'division of GM responsibilities'. Forget all that crap. All you have to do to play story games with friends is to be a little more willing to jump in and riff on what's going on. I bet that you used to do this<i>all the time</i>when you played RPGs, without even thinking about it. Like in D&amp;D, when one player says, "My character ran away from his apprenticeship with an evil wizard", and you say, "Hey, my character's uncle was an evil wizard; I be they're the same guy!", and the other player says, "Yeah!". Boom! If you really have never done that - and that's fine, lots of people have fun playing RPGs without jumping in and riffing on stuff - then you can totally practice doing it in traditional games before moving on to story games.<br/><br/>Here's the thing that totally blew my mind when I figured it out: In a traditional GM/Player game, you can jump in and riff on<i>what the GM is saying</i>. Like the GM says, "OK, you're in this restaurant in Tokyo," and you say, "Oh man I was actually in this really cool restaurant in Tokyo, it was in this little space under a train trestle, can it be like that?" and the GM says, "OK!", and you describe it. Depending on your play group, you can even skip the part where you ask for permission; just jump in and do it. (Or spend chits, or say the catch phrase, or whatever.) Again, you can practice doing this in traditional games.<br/><br/><b>2.) It's OK to play it "wrong".</b>You don't need to pore over the story game rulebook, trying to memorize every little detail, so that you will have a Correct and Accurate Story Game Experience at the table. A lot of those story game rules about fiddling with dice or cards or beads or whatever are just a pacing mechanic, so your game doesn't run for ten hours. As long as everyone is at the table for the same reason (create an engaging story), and is willing to jump in and riff on things, you're good to go. (I, personally, am<i>really bad at this.</i>I always obsess about the rules. Note to self: unclench, sit down, have fun.)<br/><br/><b>3.) The goal of a story game is to create an engaging story.</b>Well, duh. But it can be hard, when you're actually playing at the table, to stop thinking about how your character can succeed and/or survive, and start thinking about how you can make your character's<i>story</i>awesome. It's extra hard to remember to look around at the other players, and think up ways you can help make<i>their</i>character's stories awesome. But seriously, this gets easier with practice. It all comes back to jumping in and riffing on what's going on. Once you start thinking about how you can riff on things to make a better story, it gets easier to remember to do it in the future.<br/><br/><b>4.) You can totally mix Primetime Adventures with traditional games.</b>Every so often, when there's a break in the action &amp; you want to get into some deeper character moments, slip a session of PTA into your traditional game. Have everyone make PTA versions of their characters, and do a session as though your game were a television drama. My friend did this with his Star Wars game, and it worked great. (Although it was hard to find a good Issue for my Jedi. "Maybe I'm<i>Too</i>Awesome" just didn't cut it. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> )<br/><br/><b>5.) Just because a game is well-designed doesn't mean it's going to be fun for you to play.</b>Like, I'm still blown away by how well designed 4th Edition D&amp;D is. On paper, it's a great game. At the table, though, it just doesn't do what I want it to do. I bet the same is true of lots and lots of story games. When you read about how excited people are about a game, remember that a.) Maybe they're excited because it's fun for<b>them</b>to play, and b.) Maybe they're excited because they love how the game has been<b>designed</b>. Neither of those things are predictors of how you, personally, will like a game!<br/><br/><b>6.) Seriously, play with friends.</b>I mean, sure, go out and play with new gamers from time to time, but if they're not friend material, don't keep playing with them. Remember when we used to play with random groups of people, and we assumed everyone would want the same things out of the game as we would, and we thought we'd all get along because we were all gamers? Yeah no. Life's too short. Spend time with your friends.<br/><br/>That's all I got. Hope you got something useful out of it!<br/><br/>-Pjack</blockquote>\nThis guy knows what he's talking about. Seriously. Stop overthinking things, find a group playing <i>whatever</i>, and approach this stuff gradually among people who are your friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359105/#Comment_359105" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T15:49:02+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  3:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2012 4:35PM by Todd_L.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam,<br/><br/>If the con Bill invited you to is Dreamation-- you should definitely go.   <br/><br/>In the worst case scenario of your OP, you'll try some neo-hippie games/ not like them/ and there will still be a whole convention of other games for you to switch-to (both inside &amp; outside the indie-area) approached in a manner closer to your comfort zone.

I often don't know what they are talking about! <br/><br/>Sometimes after I've played once, I still don't! <br/><br/>Usually I have to play a game at least 3 times before I start to get it. Sometimes the game just isn't for me. Sometimes it is, but only when I'm in a certain mood or playing with specific people. I also play a lot of old games from the 90s, 80s, and 70s. I feel the same way about those games. <br/><br/>A lot of these games are also all over the map in terms of assumptions, styles, and skills. Fiasco looks very little like Apocalypse World which looks very little like Microscope. Sometimes it's also the GM. I've played Apocalypse World with I believe 8 different GMs, and it felt like I was playing 3 different games. <br/><br/>Right now I would describe the current RPG landscape as: full of choice, fractured, what's old is new, what's new is old, there's something for everyone. Story Games is also a small part of the larger RPG community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359120/#Comment_359120" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T19:03:23+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  7:03PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing a traditional game with a less railroady GM than the one it sounds like you started with and more sandboxing might be a good transition to a more participatory game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359140/#Comment_359140" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T20:45:05+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  8:45PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go to rpg.net.

You could have posted a "thread ends here" line under his response! :-)  But I totally like the encouragement here.<br/><br/>In short, yeah I really think you're overthinking it, perhaps making the experience into something way more than it is. It's just gaming. Go game. <br/><br/>Don't put too much into your expectations; based on what your mind is going through, it's likely you'll find your next 1-2 sessions either "Huh, that was fun. That was it??" or "Man, that was disappointing". I really hate to equate gaming to sex... uh, maybe dancing? Cause that works for me, anyway: You went dancing a lot when you were younger. Nowadays, the music is different, tastes are different, you're not sure what clubs are interesting, etc. The temptation is to overthink how you should approach going to the club and dancing again, to the point that disappointment (that it wasn't as fun as you thought it would be) is a major likely outcome. Dancing, sushi, dates, sex, visiting a zoo, traveling, performing in front of others; these feelings are natural in these activities, but it's important to get over them. It really might do to turn off the anxiety engine in your brain, and just pull the trigger on getting out there and gaming again.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where you are (tell us!), but if there's a local con or something with interesting games you're interested in trying, go for it. That would be a great opportunity to see some of these games in flight without having to invest the time in reading them beforehand or organizing the sessions yourself.<br/><br/>Most of my gaming is nothing really trad-vs-XYZ: The hardest part for me these days is remembering all the rules (if there are many), the actual gaming experience - playing a role - carries over from game to game. <br/><br/>In fact, that might serve as your cornerstone: If all fucking else fails, just show up to /play a role/. If the GM suggests something from you/your character directly ("You're a member of a kung fu temple, right? How many people are there in your temple?"), answer but then get right back into your role. If the folks around you are friendly, you can't go wrong here.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359176/#Comment_359176" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T22:24:34+00:00" title="February 12, 2012 10:24PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2012 10:28PM by zircher.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, since you mentioned the irc.magicstar.net <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a> IRC channel in another thread, I think several of us would be quite willing to throw down some titles and do some gaming with ya if that's your preferred medium.

I don't think this "new way" is all that new. I don't think the whole paradigm has shifted either. There are still tons of people playing games the way you used to.<br/><br/>It's not an issue of progressive development or historical evolution (at least not in a straightforward manner). It's rather about parallel development. I don't think you "don't get" these "story games" because they're new and different, I think it's just because they're different, period.<br/><br/>It's an issue of playstyle, not age. People praise Apocalypse World's MC-ing chapters, because those chapters give them a bunch of tools to play games the way they want to. I think that if AW's text sounds alien to you it's not so much because it's new, but because it's speaking to a different audience. I think Vincent writes for a relatively limited group of people and for those of us who are in that group, it's awesome. For others not so much, or it's just "alien".<br/><br/>So I think you need to figure out what you really want from RPGs, what itches you want them to scratch.<br/><br/>If you sat down for 4 hours to play a game, what would you want to happen in that game, so that you could leave the table satisfied and not feeling like you've wasted your time? Maybe then it will be easier to identify the games/groups/texts that speak to you.<br/><br/>In a way I'm on the opposite shore from you. AW was like mana from heaven for me. It finally delivered the experience (and the tools to craft that experience) I had been looking for since I got into RPGs. So my struggle was likewise to try to understand "alien" texts and games, but in the opposite direction...going backwards from AW to my earlier games. I didn't really "get" certain aspects of D&amp;D for a long time.<br/><br/>So I really understand the impulse to try and understand all these games that "so many folks are enjoying". There must be something to it, right? But I think it's necessary that you first figure out what you enjoy and accomplish that, before you go exploring foreign shores.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359229/#Comment_359229" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T06:54:43+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  6:54AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whew, this thread blew up while I was away!

I just turned 31. Mid life crisis?<br/><br/>Anyway... "old school" gaming still happens aplenty in my generation, as I've observed through friends, groups, conventions. My main gaming group still plays things in the manner of "GM constructs the story, players follow those rails, occasionally agency happens". But! We'll also play Fiasco and Apocalypse World and other games occasionally that are more "nu school" and have no difficulty with the transition. People often THINK they're having trouble, but really I've found it's more to do with the stigma and reputation attached to these indie games that make them think that, and less with the actual mechanics of the game. I'm wondering out loud, but was there a big difference in 80s vs 90s roleplay that helps this shift happen better in my generation? I think about White Wolf larps, and how they seem to bridge the gap between the two... players would have to make their own fun, construct a lot of the story, and then run to a GM to arbitrate the outcome. Same with online roleplay to a certain extent.<br/><br/>IN ANY CASE. My answer is the same as everyone else's in this thread. The new games are just new games... learn to play them as you would anything else that's new, and realize they're not that different from other types of roleplaying games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359234/#Comment_359234" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T07:09:11+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  7:09AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>[C]an't you be happy playing the types of games you know?

Yes, I <i>could</i> conceivably go back to playing <i>Shadowrun</i> or 3e D&amp;D like I was doing 20 and 10 years ago, respectively, but I honestly don't feel like those games were giving me <i>even at the time</i> the optimal play experience.  I'm much more interested in the kind of thing these new games talk about, such as low- or no-prep GMing.  Invariably I have ended up running the games I've played and the sheer amount of time and effort involved in constructing the narrative is exhausting.  Now that I write professionally, I'm even <i>less</i> interested in that sort of thing, largely because I'm already doing it all day long as it is.  Why would I want to do <i>work</i> when I'm trying to do <i>play</i>?<br/><br/>Since I brought up <i>Apocalypse World</i> as an example of game I don't quite get, I'll try to illustrate why I'm so torn regarding its MCing advice.  Those who've read the rules will know what I'm talking about (hopefully).<br/><br/>In AW, the first session is meant to be structured as "follow the characters around and see what they do."  From this process, the building blocks of future plot elements \u2014 places, people, situations \u2014 are forged.  But the very idea of just having players wandering around doing whatever is so contrary to my experience that my brain kind of fries a little simply reading about it.  And if I can't even take that small of a step with confidence, what's going to happen to me when I'm called upon to pull these improvised threads together into a narrative that players will take to and enjoy?<br/><br/>I write for a living and I work from strict outlines.  That's how I think about story.  The thing is, that's not the way to make these new-mode games go.  Freedom and player input are paramount, so you can imagine how that scares me to death.  I wouldn't write a single line of a manuscript without knowing where I'm going all the way to the end of 80,000 words.  These "story game" thingies don't provide that level of reassurance.  <i>BUT</i> I want to unlace my booties and go running in that field barefoot and don't much like the idea of falling back on the restrictions of the past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359239/#Comment_359239" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T07:22:16+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  7:22AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam!</cite>In AW, the first session is meant to be structured as "follow the characters around and see what they do."

Boo!<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the discussion:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>I feel you, and in some quarters of the internet (or the hobby) much is made of the distinction between traditional RPGs and "story-games." But I think that from a player perspective there's actually very little difference in what you are trying to do--or, at least, not big enough a difference to make a difference. Ultimately, as a player, your job is still to<i>make your character try to do what you want</i>, or perhaps<i>make your character try to get what he or she wants</i>. You take a chance, and you roll the dice. To me, it feels the same. Sure, the GM's role is a little different--more facilitative, less coercive, as you point out--and from my perspective that produces more satisfying outcomes at the player level, since the game responds to my vision of the character (maybe it validates that vision, or maybe it pushes back against it, but it still responds). But most games still work fine if, as a PC, you imagine what your character would want and try to get it.</blockquote>\nI suspect that a great deal of my trepidation when it comes to this form stems not so much from the player standpoint (though that is an issue), but from the idea that if I want a game, I have to run it myself.  That's pretty much been the case for me since the '80s, as no one wanted to facilitate a game except me, meaning that if I wanted to play at all, I had to be the GM.  And, frankly, the "story gaming" version of the GM's role scares me spitless.<br/><br/>I've pointed out above how I approach adventure-crafting: as a rigidly defined plot within which scenes take place and goddamn it, if someone spoils my story there'll be hell to pay.  This makes me quite railroad-y, I guess, which is a fault no matter what sort of game one runs, but isn't all that out of sync with the GM's advice we got from those first- and second-generation RPGs in the '70s and especially the '80s.  GM makes the story, players act it out.<br/><br/>I'm aware that this is no good.  For one thing, it robs players of the opportunity to really own their part of the story and, from a far more selfish point of view, it requires me as a GM to do mountains of prep-work.  Prep-work, as I've said, I no longer have it in me to do.  I <i>want</i> spontaneity.  I <i>want</i> to cast off the burden of essentially making up stories that I act out to people.<br/><br/>So you're probably right that my experience as a player will not alter dramatically under the "new rules," especially if I concentrate on knowing what my character wants and on doing things that play into those wants.  Viewed from the perspective you offer, it does seem far less intimidating.  Now I just have to figure out a way to come at GMing that doesn't scare me out of my socks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359258/#Comment_359258" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T08:37:49+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  8:37AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not a big proponent of learning to play a game in a con environment.

We were all dyed-in-the-wool "traditional" gamers and all this shared-narrative, collaborative fiction stuff would have turned them off in a hurry.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>What is it about this style of play that's most attractive to you?

I'm still, some 20 years after the fact, stinging from a <i>Shadowrun</i> campaign in which I played where the GM completely ignored the cool stuff I wanted to incorporate into my character \u2014 purely story-related stuff, not mechanical awesomeness \u2014 in favor of what he wanted to do.  I'm not a munchkin, I just want to be able to express my creativity in a way that adds to the experience.<br/><br/>What attracts me <i>as a GM</i> is the lessened need for onerous preparation.  I just don't have the time or the inclination to do all that heavy lifting anymore, especially since I'm doing that kind of stuff day in and day out as my occupation.  I like the idea of being able to just <i>play</i>.<br/><br/>On the converse side, I fear the same things that attract me because they <i>are</i> so different from what I'm used to, and flailing around at the table with people watching is not fun for anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359263/#Comment_359263" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T08:54:53+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  8:54AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>[Y]ou aren't going to be "called upon to pull...improvised threads into a narrative..."

I think of narrative as something the GM creates and the players interact with.  What you're talking about (if I have my terminology correct) is emergent play, a concept I have a tough time with.  With everything from D&amp;D to <i>James Bond 007</i>, the narrative was a framework applied from above, not something that occurred organically.  So whereas you're telling me to just respond to players' input and let the story occur however it plays out, my brain is telling me, "Make up a plot!  <i>Any</i> plot!

Like the GM says, "OK, you're in this restaurant in Tokyo," and you say, "Oh man I was actually in this really cool restaurant in Tokyo, it was in this little space under a train trestle, can it be like that?" and the GM says, "OK!", and you describe it. Depending on your play group, you can even skip the part where you ask for permission; just jump in and do it. (Or spend chits, or say the catch phrase, or whatever.) Again, you can practice doing this in traditional games.</blockquote>\nI have no experience with this, not from either side of the GM's screen.  That doesn't mean I haven't tried \u2014 please make a note of the horrible <i>Shadowrun</i> game I mentioned in another post \u2014 but I've never had it actually work.  Back-and-forth creation between GM and player?  Totally different from anything I've ever done.<br/><br/>A number of people have pointed out here (and Pjack is one of them) that I'm probably over-thinking this.  I suspect that's actually true.  This may stem from my sense of perfectionism, which demands that I stick the landing first time, every time.  I don't give myself a lot of room for failures, small or large, and it appears that a willingness to fail is a key ingredient in enjoying what story games have to offer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359267/#Comment_359267" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T09:04:39+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  9:04AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, reading In a Wicked Age may be of comfort to you. <br/>If you set up the initial situation well, the game kind of plays itself in terms of plot.

Example:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "What does the hotel room look like?"<br/>\nGM: "I don't know? What do you think it looks like?"<br/>\nPlayer: "Well, I suspect it's a double bed, and..."<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might seem like you're copping out as a GM, or like you're under-prepared, but from the player's side of things, it rarely looks that way. What the players get out of that is agency. They own that little piece of the story now, and every time you reference the hotel room, they get to interact with what they've made. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as being "that guy" at the game table, as Bill White said above, hippie story gamers love everybody. One of my greatest delights in running games is helping a new players get their feet wet in a new system, be it Pathfinder, or Fiasco.

If you're too worried about it, you become "apology guy" who asks for minor forgiveness every time you have to ask for rules clarification. Relax.

That was it??" or "Man, that was disappointing". I really hate to equate gaming to sex... uh, maybe dancing? Cause that works for me, anyway: You went dancing a lot when you were younger. Nowadays, the music is different, tastes are different, you're not sure what clubs are interesting, etc. The temptation is to overthink how you should approach going to the club and dancing again, to the point that disappointment (that it wasn't as fun as you thought it would be) is a major likely outcome. Dancing, sushi, dates, sex, visiting a zoo, traveling, performing in front of others; these feelings are natural in these activities, but it's important to get over them. It really might do to turn off the anxiety engine in your brain, and just pull the trigger on getting out there and gaming again.</blockquote>\nThis is solid advice, and thank you for switching out from sex to dancing.  For everyone except Baptists, that makes things a lot less awkward. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I really do think that my long absence from gaming in any real-life venue has affected my ability to look at the pastime without anxiety.  It used to be really easy: show up with your bag of dice, sit down, eat some pizza and kill some bad guys.  Now there's the whole thing about whether I'm too outmoded as a player to acquit myself adequately when playing these new, cool games and that interrupts the process.<br/><br/>I will say that I envy the folks here who have regular groups that offer the support necessary to transition from new game to new game with a minimum of drama.  I also wish I was in a physical location where more gaming stuff goes on, because that's not really the case, excluding those locales that are infested with cats.  It seems like there are certain hot-spots in the US where tons of gamers just happen to live within a short drive from one another.  And lastly, of course, I'm envious of people who don't have severe pet allergies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359286/#Comment_359286" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T09:50:37+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  9:50AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zircher</cite>Sam, since you mentioned the irc.magicstar.net <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a> IRC channel in another thread, I think several of us would be quite willing to throw down some titles and do some gaming with ya if that's your preferred medium.

Boy was I totally wrong!  I met some Vampire players (who were also theatre semi-pros) and finally played in that style, but still had no idea how it worked on the GM side.  He just did all this magical stuff that I couldn't see.  But I still thought I kinda knew.  And I tried to play some indie games that were sandbox-y and failed pretty horribly: Shadow of Yesterday, Poison'd, etc. I thought I understood how those games worked after reading them, but then I got them to the table and they completely fell flat.  Really, it wasn't until, like, last year -- after playing and running a bunch of AW -- that I felt like I finally understood how all those games -- including a bunch of games I played for years and years -- are supposed to be run.  How much time have I spent thinking about games?  And I just now figured out one of the _fundamental_ ways in which RPing can be done?<br/><br/>My next project, at some point, is to figure out the (related but not identical) "old school" style, which I have some sense of but don't have much direct experience.  I'm turning 30 this year and feel like I'm starting my gaming education all over again, more or less!  My sense now is that there are a handful of common playing styles (including at least: "GM planned," "sandbox," "old school," "PTA/SG-style scene framing," and a number of quazi-GM-less styles) and that it's very rare for a person to really understand, enjoy, and effectively facilitate all of them.  The good news is that we're all in the same boat together: trying to learn new styles of play and expand our comfort zone and skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359292/#Comment_359292" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T10:01:50+00:00" title="February 13, 2012 10:01AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>I often think I'm too old for gaming, in general. I just turned 31. Mid life crisis?</blockquote>\nDon't think the idea hasn't occurred to me.  I'm 41 and I keep bumping into people who are steeped in the whole "story gaming" thing that are in their early to mid-20s, which is almost a generation removed from my experience.  I feel like a dinosaur.  Nobody gets my in-references.  Nobody played <i>The Price of Freedom</i> unironically.  So maybe a whole facet of my gaming anxiety stems from the mere fact that I'm middle-aged and not a 21-year-old college student anymore.  Even 31 seems like an age ago.\n<blockquote>Anyway... "old school" gaming still happens aplenty in my generation, as I've observed through friends, groups, conventions. My main gaming group still plays things in the manner of "GM constructs the story, players follow those rails, occasionally agency happens". But! We'll also play Fiasco and Apocalypse World and other games occasionally that are more "nu school" and have no difficulty with the transition. People often THINK they're having trouble, but really I've found it's more to do with the stigma and reputation attached to these indie games that make them think that, and less with the actual mechanics of the game.</blockquote>\nHmm... I had not considered this.  Maybe it has to do with the tribalism exhibited by some (not all) of the people involved in the "traditional" and "indie" communities.  Someone in this very thread said, "Go to RPGnet and you'll find tons of people like you," which was intended to be a helpful suggestion, but has the (probably unintended) side effect of sounding like a dismissal from the group.  I've been reading the "killing orc babies" thread and some of the back-and-forth between those people who take the potential for child-killing, even imaginary child-killing, very seriously indeed and those who say "eff that noise" has echoes of the inter-camp rivalries that have unfortunately sprung up in the hobby.<br/><br/>But that's probably food for another thread altogether.  Your observation that the difference is 90% perception versus 10% reality is well taken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359294/#Comment_359294" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T10:03:00+00:00" title="February 13, 2012 10:03AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll go ahead and echo the people who are saying "Stop being so damn nervous and PLAY!"<br/><br/>It seems to me like it's all in your head.

There's lots of That Guys. The real "That Guy" at the con who spoils the game is the unrepentent asshole who wants his way over everyone else's fun; the guy who showed up but has absolutely no interest in the genre or motif ("The guy who showed up to play PTA who hates TV and everything it represented"); the people who don't shower and smell like cat piss. The "That Guy" - "Who is confused at first about the rules and procedures until about an hour in" is so low on the "That Guy" hierarchy... For me, the Cellphone Guy, Guy who eats everyone's food without asking/thanking, and the like are way worse.<br/>Well, I <i>do</i> shower regularly and though my clothes are often dusted with dog hair, I generally don't smell like urine.  So I definitely have that going for me.<br/><br/>I will also admit that some of my reluctance to get involved in games I don't know well stems from a not-so-great convention experience I had some 20+ years ago in which I signed up for a GURPS game despite knowing f\u2014 all about GURPS.  It was a feudal Japanese storyline, though, and that sounded awesome.  But then it turned out that I was the only person at the table who didn't know the system backward and forward and so I spent at least as much time grappling with the game itself as I did playing my character.  I could tell it was getting on the GM's nerves, for sure, and I was careful afterward never to put myself in that position again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359302/#Comment_359302" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T10:16:23+00:00" title="February 13, 2012 10:16AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2012 10:20AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Sam!<br/><br/>Your anxiety makes a lot of sense to me: you're used to things working a certain way, and you don't get a really clear sense of what mechanism in these games replaces those things. What makes it work?<br/><br/>I, too, find a lot of games (especially Vincent's games, which I love a great deal) really really hard to understand just by reading the rules. (Especially Apocalypse World and In a Wicked Age..., I think Dogs is the best text in terms of advice that makes sense and you can just follow.) We have a long way to go, still, to making texts that are clear and awesome (although this community gets better at it every year.)<br/><br/>Let me try an analogy:<br/><br/>As a writer, you work from an outline. When you're writing your first sentence, you know how the story will end: this gives you some great ideas about what to write. "If it ends like so, then the first sentence should be like so."<br/><br/>If you don't know where the story is going, how in the world do you know how to start it?<br/><br/>Well, as a writer I'm sure you're familiar with the "other school" of fiction writer, writers who like the fiction to "emerge" naturally. Stephen King's excellent "On Writing" comes to mind, and many other well-known authors also like to write one step at a time, claiming they themselves are "surprised" by where their characters take them.<br/><br/>Does that point of view make any sense to you at all? (King's book is really good, whether you like his fiction or not--and it's very short, too.)<br/><br/>It's basically how these games work. <br/><br/>Another related analogy might be some kind of writing exercise where you take turns with a group of people, each adding on to an existing story. The rules are: "We're writing a fantasy novel. We each take turns adding a paragraph, then pass it on to the next writer." <br/><br/>How would you "play" this game? You can hopefully see that you can come to the table with an idea in mind, and craft an introduction based on that idea. But you also know very well that by the time the pen and paper comes your way again, you'll have to have discarded all those ideas and run with what's on the page.<br/><br/>All the weird advice in Apocalypse World and Play Unsafe is guidelines for how to make that process easier for yourself. Because if you come to the table with an idea of *how things will go*, and then are forced to discard it because another player "spoiled" your vision, you're going to feel angry and frustrated. You need different tools!<br/><br/>Writing from an outline, it sounds like, is your tool, for both play and writing. But you have to trust that there are other tools that are also functional.<br/><br/>If this makes any sense to you, let me know. I'll prepare another post which gives a "mock-up" of a scene from a Forge-style "story game", and how it leads to the next scene, which may help you understand. (If you're interested, of course.)<br/><br/>(P.S. I'm also allergic to cats!

I'm still, some 20 years after the fact, stinging from a<i>Shadowrun</i>campaign in which I played where the GM completely ignored the cool stuff I wanted to incorporate into my character \u2014 purely story-related stuff, not mechanical awesomeness \u2014 in favor of what he wanted to do. I'm not a munchkin, I just want to be able to express my creativity in a way that adds to the experience.<br/><br/>What attracts me<i>as a GM</i>is the lessened need for onerous preparation. I just don't have the time or the inclination to do all that heavy lifting anymore, especially since I'm doing that kind of stuff day in and day out as my occupation. I like the idea of being able to just<i>play</i>.<br/><br/>On the converse side, I fear the same things that attract me because they<i>are</i>so different from what I'm used to, and flailing around at the table with people watching is not fun for anyone.<br/><br/>I'm probably gonna be the stick in the mud in this thread when I state my opinion on this: I don't know that the magic "just happens". You will fail a lot. It's okay to overthink it ... as long as all that overthinking isn't leading you into cul-de-sacs or paralyzing you.<br/><br/>It seems, to me, like there are several flavors of new tech being explored. Some of it works very well by just doing it, some of it works well only after failing a lot.<br/><br/>Economics tricks: This is where you've got games that mess with reward/punishment that has a mechanistic impact. Some of the games reward individual social behavior (fan mail), some of them reward good story-making (artha), some of them reward other unexpected stuff (like table teamwork, in Burning Empires). I think that if you can really focus on the economies built into these games and what behaviors are actually being addressed, you'll get a long ways toward figuring out the intent of the game. It's also super-easy to get misled, possibly via poor explanation or your own expectations, and try to shoehorn a game's economy into how you think it "should" work. I think economics tricks, I think Luke's games.<br/><br/>(Re)Framing tricks: I think Vincent's games are really good at forcing the participants to frame up situations in certain ways via his mechanics. So like in Dogs it's all about escalating levels of force, because the whole game is strongly premised on "how much force are you willing to use to get what you want?" It's not about how good a shot your dude is, it's about how willing you, the player, are to introduce mortal violence into a scene. Or like AW: everything's about being cool, hot, smart, weird, etc. If you mapped IAWA's "with love/etc." stuff onto AW it'd be a much different game. So same thing, right? Figure out how the mechanics force the players to frame up situations and you're golden. Try to turn a fictional framing engine into a physics engine and you're looking at "situation" in entirely the wrong end of the telescope.<br/><br/>Authority tricks: Games that decentralize or rearrange authority have IMO the most profound impact on how quickly the game experience vectors away from "tradition". Authority got hit hard by a lot of designers: Lehman, Newman and Morningstar all have different, excellent games that move or eliminate authority roles traditionally found in oldskool games. There are more subtle examples of this in other designs (fact establishment via -wise rolls in BW for example). The fact that your expected authority structures are upended can, all by its lonesome, be massively disruptive. Can be good, might be bad. I've had players react the MOST negatively to this. I think that authority tricks are where you largely run into "this is not an RPG" type feelings.<br/><br/>Ritual tricks: This, to my mind, is sort of everything else. Lighting a candle, shaking hands, ritual phrases. It's all very soft and nonmechanical. I find it hard to evaluate, before actually doing it, what impact a ritual will have on play. I've had players react very poorly to this stuff, mostly because it feels weird or faggy or whatever. I think the point of a lot of these rituals is to get players out of their emotional comfort zones, so this reaction is to be expected among some folks. I've also had players really lap it up. Very case dependent. Proceed with caution. :-)<br/><br/>There's probably a larger/different breakdown available but this is what pops into my head when I think about the subject of how storygame-style design differs. However you find you break this stuff down yourself, I guess what I'd say is most important is to really hit the difference *hard*, figure out how to leverage it, and play toward the designer's intent once you think you've figured it out. I have a beef with the designers who aim for "emergent behaviors" by hiding their design intent, but if/when it works it's a neat trick.<br/><br/>For the record: I'm 42, I've been professionally involved in traditional roleplaying design in my past, I just had my first kid and I run my own business.

I always hated improv back when I took drama in high school for much the same reasons I skirt around tabletop improv now: the total lack of control one has over the narrative.  The author in me wants to nail everything down, but you can't play these games that way.  Everyone's responsible for their bit and how those bits interact is what the game becomes.<br/><br/>You do have control, but it is control of a different kind. IAWA gives you Best Interests, which are very powerful. You just go through the list of your NPCs and you wonder "how would she pursue her best interest now?" and then follow up with the most obvious answer. When you frame the scene between players you ask yourself "How can I put them in potential conflict?" then you frame the scene.<br/><br/>You are basically setting up a mechanism, an engine, that throws questions at you, the GM. As a GM you answer - moment-by-moment - the questions generated by the engine and the questions generated by the players.. and that's your job.<br/><br/>Try a dry run of IAWA, simulating a solo game, and you will see that it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359322/#Comment_359322" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T11:06:55+00:00" title="February 13, 2012 11:06AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Sam, I'm 53 and started playing in 1974 when D&amp;D was first published.

And let me make a plug for <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play</a> the podcast Bill and I produce.  The podcast uses excerpts from games to talk about the roleplaying experience, which I hope helps get to the point of an episode rather than listening to a complete actual play game.  At the very least, the excerpts provide a sample of what some of these games 'sound' like, at least in one group.  And perhaps some shows address issues that have been mentioned earlier in this thread.  Episode 46 addresses Burning Wheel from a GM's perspective as the audience to the players' actions.  Episode 45 compares emergent play--'Story Now'--with more traditional pre-generated plot driven play--'Story Before'--using two Traveller games.  Episodes 43 and 48 are about Sorcerer and The One Ring, respectively, and are relevant because I included in those excerpts some of the difficulties my group had in interpreting or finding the rules.  Many times we are learning these games as we play but our errors don't stop us!  Older episodes of Virtual Play are at the <br/> <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=%22virtual%20play%20archives%22&amp;sort=-publicdate" rel="nofollow">Internet Archive</a>.  <br/>Episode 18 includes the discussion on 'Turtling', which is what I felt myself doing while playing With Great Power, as Bill mentioned.<br/>While I find podcasts informative and entertaining, my biggest reaction to listening is to want to play!

I need to find those people, but at least the course is set.</blockquote>\nThe good news is, "emergent" story play is much, much easier than "emergent" story writing. Because when you're writing you have to kind fool yourself that your characters are acting on their own whims and leading the story. In a game, though, there's no illusion: the character really *are* doing unexpected things on their own, thanks to the players making those decisions for them.<br/><br/>The way a lot of "story games" go is kind of like this... here's another analogy:<br/><br/>Do you recognize that when you're playing an RPG, playing a character, you're improvising, making stuff up as you go along? You improvise your character's dialogue, your character's decisions. You improvise details about them: suddenly your character is going to a fancy dress ball, and you must decide, "Does my character like fancy dress balls?" You decide that, no, she doesn't, because she grew up hating the next door neighbours, who always attended fancy dress balls. You also improvise "plot", by making significant decisions ("I'm going to betray the Duke and murder his messenger").<br/><br/>If that makes sense to you, can you imagine playing <i>two</i> characters this way in a story? What about three?<br/><br/>GMing many "story games" is just like that: you have a small group of characters that you play, just like the players, while in a scene in the story. You make up what they do and why they do it, and how they do it.<br/><br/>The other part of playing the game as a GM is "framing scenes": deciding where a scene takes place and who is there, then deciding when the scene is over (no wrong answers here, really). If the game gives you interesting characters with strong desires (like In a Wicked Age... or Dogs in the Vineyard), the game goes "by itself" after that, not through magical improvisation mastery, but by virtue of the good stuff that's already built into the fiction and the rules for resolving conflicts.<br/><br/>For example, playing In a Wicked Age... is not unlike saying, "Hey, Bob: you've been planning to kill Jennifer, haven't you? And Jennifer, you want to seduce Bob, right? OK, the two of you are sitting in a bar at closing time, and everyone else has just left. Go!" Then you sit back and let them play it out. You can see how that works on its own, right? Well, the only difference is that sometimes you'll be playing one of your own characters in these scenes, too.<br/><br/>I think the best way to learn is to play a game as a player, with a person who knows the game well and is enthusiastic about it. Then, either as you go along or afterwards, ask the GM how and why they're doing what they're doing. Have them explain it to you every step of the way, and it'll make sense: the bizarre rules and things in the books and on the forums take shape in the concrete reality of that particular game.<br/><br/>Edit: It's not magic, it's just a different tool. Like how you write from an outline and Stephen King doesn't. But you could each learn to do it the other's way, if you cared to enough.<br/><br/>If you'd like to get more insight into a particular set of tools, you can start a hypothetical game in a thread here on Story Games, have a forum member create a character for it, and then ask us to help you "prep" for the game. You'll get some insight into the process, and see where you're stumbling and lost versus where you find it easy and logical. I think a lot of people would enjoy a thread like that, actually!<br/><br/>I believe that most "indie" games were designed by frustrated GMs who wanted to get away from plotting and outlines and wanted to give more weight to the players' decisions--wanted to be surprised more often by what happened in play, and to enjoy those surprises rather than being frustrated by them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359367/#Comment_359367" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T13:27:25+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  1:27PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2012 1:30PM by johnzo.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, assuming you manage to find a convention / other cat-free gaming situation, what about starting out by just watching the games you're interested in?

To be productive as a writer, I had to ruthlessly prune my idea space.  Each story or novel was born of some small set of coherent ideas that I loved enough to warrant the enormous energy and time I'd spend driving it to its conclusion.  I had to have a high bar for any new ideas that presented themselves during composition because distraction was fatal.  <br/><br/>Later I discovered those habits were ... suboptimal for story games.<br/><br/>The good news is that I think that I'm past those problems, or at least I'm aware enough of my author mode that I can try to shut it down when it starts threatening a game.  Lucky for me, a lot of people were very patient with me as I figured this out!  And you're right, it took more than words on a page to break me of these habits.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam!</cite>More gamers need to be dog people.</blockquote>\nMore people need to be dog people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359371/#Comment_359371" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T14:09:47+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  2:09PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Incidentally, this whole thread reminds me of a slew of very similar conversations happening around the time the Forge was coming into existence as a significant internet entity.

Kind of an action horror game where the rules focus on roleplay (instant reward for "good roleplay") and character interaction (you track your relationships with others, goals, etc).<br/><br/>There's a GM, players, combat, etc. And yet there are also scenes, social reward mechanics, etc. So it's like a traditional experience with some hippiness sprinkled on it.<br/><br/>Anyway, John Stravopolous/jenskot here designed the character sheet for it, it's really slick looking.<br/><br/>Might want to check that out if that genre appeals to you. Mark's a great GM for including everyone, making sure everyone understands the game and each other's concerns/desires, and is a great storyteller to book.

I wasn't getting enough opportunities to play from the "hippie" catalog. When I did play or run some of these games I sometimes felt like there were things I wasn't getting from them.  So I got on a plane and went to Dreamation even though I'd never gone to a con outside of Portland in my life (and only one or two of those).  I am forty-three, by the way.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it so much that I went back the next year. In my two trips I got to play Spirit of the Century and Dictionary of Mu with Judd, Polaris with Ben, Shock with Joshua, Dogs with Vincent, Burning Wheel with Luke &amp; Grey Ranks with Jason. I also had a great time in playtest sessions of Misspent Youth, S7S, Kingdom of Nothing, Criminal Element &amp; Giants. I met and talked with so many cool people about these and other games.<br/><br/>I haven't been able to make it back since but I really felt like the exposure to these games from people who knew them well put me on a road to feeling more comfortable with new styles of play and I resolved to find and/or develop a similar community of players in my hometown.<br/><br/>I think you will be really glad you went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360418/#Comment_360418" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-18T10:20:32+00:00" title="February 18, 2012 10:20AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I've promised Sam that he gets to play in my carry game, no matter what.

So, a bit of performance anxiety, like being in a local garage band with Lou Reed.<br/><br/>But for the most part, even the folks who can get a little deep in the weeds theory-wise, or have... Strong opinions about what makes for a good game when they're having a talk about them all seem to just want people to have fun playing their games when they actually get off the Internet and hit the table, both publicly and privately.<br/><br/>So go and play, with both friends and strangers, and expect a few sessions won't work, and be delighted when a few are amazing, and don't sweat the generation gap and you'll do fine. And most importantly, remember that getting into the new stuff never means you have to give up or disavow the stuff you've played all along.

the blind confidence of youth.</blockquote>\nTrufact: I would not have been in the right head space @ 22 to enjoy the benefits of this style of play. I've been committed to improving my craft since my very first game @ 11, but that improvement was along very traditional lines built entirely on personal experience, the wishes of my play groups, and my own half-baked ideas about the highest and best uses of the medium as I understood it.<br/><br/>In 1996ish, I was hired by Precedence Publishing to create a new edition of their Immortal RPG. I built this GMless, card-driven, distributed-creative-authority thing and playtested it with them for several months. The whole time, like, I'm scared! And they're scared! The emotions surrounding playing this was were visceral and weird and just...very hard to figure out why we were all so freaked out this whole time. I was terrified of "letting go" of a central creative director. They were scared as players of having to build this, I don't know, cooperative creative superstructure that they'd never, ever even thought about before. Like every other publisher of the time, every rule of every game was built on the assumption of a strong GM who's just going to ignore and rewrite all the rules anyway. So bringing in this rules-driven, decentralized thing felt nothing like, well...it felt like nothing they could sell, ultimately. So we ended up scuttling that design and went back to ye olde trad trough. The actual 2E books ended up being a total fucking disaster. Worst design work of my life.<br/><br/>My takeaway from that whole experience was that the emotional investment of everyone involved, even me as the creator, was so unshakeable that we couldn't figure out how to find the fun inside it. I had designed it largely as an ideological statement (some really old Usenet posts I had written about where the RPG hobby needed to move have circulated now for a couple decades; Graham was the last one to bring them up, a couple years ago) but, lacking a ready audience who'd already been sold on the benefits of the play, couldn't really keep it going. I feel like that same investment/fear continues in the minds of a lot of us old(er) pharts whose local audience -- their play groups -- still need to be sold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360580/#Comment_360580" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T14:18:14+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  2:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam!</cite>Good news: I may be able to make it for Thursday night.

I enjoyed the concept of Immortal and much of the fictional content was thoroughly awesome to my 1990s self. The system was kind of a problem, though, yeah. But if you still have any of the docs around from ye olden days, I'd be excited to see them if they could be cleared to be dumped on a website somewhere and they were in a comprehensible form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374009/#Comment_374009" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-22T06:35:35+00:00" title="April 22, 2012  6:35AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamey asked me about this the other day as well.

I bought a pre-release copy of Immortal at the San Diego ComiCon way back in the 90s, and while it had some major flaws and was totally gonzo, there were some really neat ideas going on in it. Your GM-less version sounds like it would be a much better way to play it than a typical "party of PCs" style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374063/#Comment_374063" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T02:22:11+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  2:22AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2012 2:36AM by Frank T.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sam, so when I first read this I thought you are chickening out. So you want to play, theoretically, but <i>only if</i> there\u2019s no work involved, and <i>only if</i> you already know in advance what it\u2019ll be like, and <i>only if</i> you have a guarantee that you\u2019ll not suck, and <i>only if</i> your family life and your bank account don\u2019t have to suffer, and... but okay, you've actually agreed to play in a couple of games so I guess you're making the leap of faith after all, which is great!<br/><br/>You\u2019ve only ever gamed with people from the same pool of players, right? Mostly you GM\u2019ing, with crappy systems from the 80s? You had an idea of what role-playing as a medium might be capable of and you made up all this elaborate stuff you were excited about but somehow you always had to carry the dead weight of the other players and at some point you couldn\u2019t go on? Man, you have NO IDEA what\u2019s out there. What role-playing can be like with creative, motivated, supportive, fun players all around the table. <br/><br/>Some sacrifices will be required, but if you played Golf instead, that would consume more time and money. I have a full-time job and a family life as many here do and sure it's not as trivial to make room for the hobby, it is of course a matter of priorities. Some effort will also be required, maybe not in prep if you play one of them hippie games, but at the table you\u2019ve got to be willing to push yourself and be as creative, engaging and sharp as you can be, if you want play to be really rewarding (<i>doubly</i> so if there\u2019s no prep!)

It is not inappropriate for a person \u2014 in this case, me \u2014 to want to align as many positive factors as possible before committing to something that takes time, money and effort.  Also, as has been said many times on this forum and elsewhere, no gaming is better than bad gaming, so I don't feel it's too much to ask that an experience be at least somewhat worthwhile, and if that experience comes wrapped up in a number of negatives, that's likely to not be the case.<br/><br/>In the end I did choose to take the plunge and play some games, but I did so only after careful consideration of what was said in this discussion, which was the point of the whole thing.  I wanted a variety of people's takes on the situation and for the most part those takes were supportive and encouraging.  I can't think of one who basically told me I was wrong to have these concerns.  Well, maybe Zak S, but he's a bomb-thrower.<br/><br/>Like it or not, choosing to game as an adult is not an easy decision to make.  Spare time is at a premium.  Cash is at a premium.  Effort is at a premium.  And it was a hell of lot easier to commit resources to gaming as a teenager because, quite frankly, we were a lot more likely to accept a sub-optimal experience back then, whether it was because we didn't know better or for other reasons.  I'm very much not a teenager anymore and my expectation of benefit is higher.<br/><br/>You'll also note, if you go back to read what I said earlier in this discussion, that I also didn't want to waste <i>other people's</i> time.  My concern wasn't all about me, but for those who'd have to accommodate my less than state-of-the-art roleplaying skills.  I'm a solid storyteller (I do it for a living), but roleplaying isn't just telling stories, otherwise we'd be around a fire somewhere spinning tales, not throwing dice at a table.<br/><br/>I appreciate your input into this now long-dead conversation \u2014 it only started up again because of some off-topic chit-chat \u2014 but consider next time what you're saying when someone expresses valid concerns.  If this discussion had consisted entirely of people pooh-poohing my worries, there'd be one less roleplayer in this world, which is kind of the opposite of what this hobby needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374092/#Comment_374092" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T08:29:08+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  8:29AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look, Sam, it was not my intention to offend you.
