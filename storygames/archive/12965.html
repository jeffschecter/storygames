It's sometimes one of the only ways to find a long OoP game. Fortunately companies like Mongoose are catching on to that and rereleasing games that are true to the original, but they can't cover every game out there. It was a stroke of luck that I was able to find Dragonlance 5th Age at all, let alone at a decent price. Filesharing's precursor, tape sharing, is also the reason that the complete Dr Who is actually available. So there's simply that factor that makes it very much a good thing. Naturally there's a concern of people only pirating and not otherwise buying, but in a practical sense you need to read off paper, so in all likelihood if you're seriously using the game you'll buy it anyway - it's not worth the inconvenience of reading off a computer screen if you have the money. I actually ran into a guy in a local store who was looking for 3e FR material, the storeowner said they were OoP and that PDFs may be an option to which he responded that he already had them but he wanted the physical copies for actual playing. If you've got people who just download games and don't ever pay for them, odds are they're not playing the games.<br/><br/>As for sending PDF copies to players, go for it. Most of my players are happy to play but they wouldn't buy it, so if I want to make any use of my purchase I have to pretty much give them free material to work with. I imagine your players are likely the same if you're asking this question. Copying the PDFs is a necessity to actually get anything out of it in the first place - otherwise you're just buying it and never using it, and at that point you just don't feel like buying anything anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292264/#Comment_292264" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T12:20:14+00:00" title="September  8, 2010 12:20PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is legal in Finland, no bones about it.

I don't particularly emphasize this anywhere, it's just available for people who feel that they need the permission. The file is the same in both cases, so the other just has you pay $15 more for the explicit permission to copy the file around. I think the sales ratio between the two licenses is something like 50:1 for the cheaper one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292266/#Comment_292266" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T12:27:48+00:00" title="September  8, 2010 12:27PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not a situation I run into a whole lot, since usually I play stuff that at least half of the group already owns, but I approach sending copies of PDFs to people in your group the same way that I would approach passing around a physical copy for people to read before playing.

If, for example, the PDF was $8 and the "group license" was $10 or 12, I'd consider it. Maybe.<br/><br/>After seeing 4-packs of virtual copies of Left 4 Dead on sale for preorder ($10 off a total of 4, so where normally the price would be $160 for 4, it's $150; you give the three download keys to your friends, who presumably paid you in cash or Paypal or whatever), I have been thinking about this option for physical books. Some of these fat fucking books like Dresden or Hellas are really prime for a "group all in" purchase. It would be interesting if someone tried to, say, offer a "4 copy deal" for a gaming group (or 5; 6; making adjustments to price accordingly) where the total was the combined prices of all four books (with likely cheaper shipping than if they were all shipped separately) at a $20 off discount for the lot or whatever (on a $40+ game). <br/><br/>but that's another conversation, sorry for the derail.<br/><br/>But yeah, we do this a lot: For those "games that come with a free PDF", 1-2 people have the physical book (or more in rare cases), and everyone gets the PDF for review.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292358/#Comment_292358" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T16:59:19+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  4:59PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>Eero - I had site licenses in the back of my mind.

Anyone who uses multiple licenses of a product distributes it among friends. If they're going to distribute it on a filesharing service they're getting the cheapest single use license. There are some fringe cases like people thinking that Windows 7 is shareware due to the 30 day activation grace period, but that's a small minority, and Microsoft leaves that ambiguous on purpose. Their concern with pirated software is that it's done wit unscrupulous OEMs who would install malware along with it, rather than single users doing an install without code from a friend's disc, and they've said before that they prefer people pirate their software than use someone else's free software, as it gets them marketshare. <br/><br/>Probably the easiest way to deal with it though is if you have a large enough fan base, follow Stolze's ransom model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292362/#Comment_292362" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T17:16:26+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  5:16PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I take 2 approaches:\n<ol>\n<li>Surprisingly I get a bunch of comped books; I refuse to share these books with my friends I have not paid for the right to play them with my group.

I know that isn't how it works in the real world, but if you were to ask me that's what I'd say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292571/#Comment_292571" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T10:30:23+00:00" title="September  9, 2010 10:30AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is one of the things that I think is brilliant about the packaging of Apocalypse World.  All of the main player-facing rules are available for free download, but the information you need to make them all work together are for sale.  This means that I can print out the trifold player books and rules reference, and hand them out without guilt (because they are available as free PDFs from the author's official website), and there's no pressure to *buy* the book because all the rules are on the character sheets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293273/#Comment_293273" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T18:59:43+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  6:59PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>I ask the author what's cool by her.<br/><br/>(edited to add: this is wrt PDFs -- I share all kinds of books by loaning them out)</blockquote>\nSpeaking of asking the author, would Jake like to chime in on how he feels about people who downloaded Classroom Deathmatch when it was free handing it out to friends?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293275/#Comment_293275" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T19:04:08+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  7:04PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            you know i dont even think about this when i print out an extra rule book for a board game? i also like cwilbur's observation about Apocalypse World                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293277/#Comment_293277" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T19:20:16+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  7:20PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>you know i dont even think about this when i print out an extra rule book for a board game? i also like cwilbur's observation about Apocalypse World</blockquote>\nApocalypse World (AW) seems to be the opposite of your standard board game.  Boardgames give you the rules (often) but make you pay for the board and pieces - AW gives you the board and pieces and withholds the rules.  Of course, with a board game you can share the rules and your friends will still have to play your copy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294843/#Comment_294843" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T18:43:38+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  6:43PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>I ask the author what's cool by her.<br/><br/>(edited to add: this is wrt PDFs -- I share all kinds of books by loaning them out)</blockquote>\nSpeaking of asking the author, would Jake like to chime in on how he feels about people who downloaded Classroom Deathmatch when it was free handing it out to friends?<br/><br/>Classroom Dethmatch was available as a free PDF (and soon will be again), so I never had any problem with people distributing it. I should have included an encouragement to distribute it, as well as permission to copy the pdf. I was told by a few people that their local Kinkos or (whatever) wouldn't let them print the pdf. Now that the book is going back in print I'm even more enthusiastic about people sharing the file. It's always cool when people show me their spiral bound copies of teh game, or the cards character or weapon cards that they made, or the quick start ruels that they created for friends who don't want to slog through the pdf.<br/><br/>So yeah. No problems. Same with Ocean., You can buy the book i fyou want a book, or you can just download the pdf. If you want top give the pdf to a friends, or print some extras out so you ahve enough to pass around your group, that's totally fine. As long as you don't sell it I don't care.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
