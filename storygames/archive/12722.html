Do we want to discuss it here?<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>[Distro 3]<br/>Yeah, I was just talking in detail with Elizabeth about this because I may have a commercial product next year. Neither the IPR or Design Matters model seems to make the most sense for debuting a new game that you expect to sell 50+ copies, just because you lose so much money either on IPR's retailer cut or the DM profit-sharing model (like Gregor last year with 3:16), unless the other profit-sharers are also debuting hot new games. I would be really interested in seeing some threads about the best way, business wise, to debut a new product in a way that will actually make you some money.</blockquote>\nWell, I'm hoping to make money with my new release. The Con knows this and can charge appropriately (the numbers show that there is indeed an opportunity to make money), so a 10x10 booth costs about $1600. When you figure in other booth expenses (e.g. furniture, storage, transport, and the ability to take credit card, which is a must) your budget will be about $2000-2500. Let's say $2500.<br/><br/>SCENARIO 1<br/>So, me setting up my own booth and selling 100 copies of a book at $20 each is going to get me $2k, which is $500 short, AND I'm now out 100 books where I paid for the printing. Say each book costs me $4 that's another $400 down, for a total loss of $900. Huh. Seems a stoopid idea. But I do have my personal presence to con goers. My booth has just my stuff.<br/><br/>SCENARIO 2<br/>IPR is a potential solution for me too. They take 56% of the cover price and I get 44% BUT I don't have to pay anything up front for a booth myself. They're the ones taking on that cost (and they get it back out of the 56% they take for every book sold). 100 copies sold like that gets me $880, out of which I need to pay the $400 printing cost. So I could be looking at a profit of $480. It's "only" $4.80 a book but it is profiit. You are in with a large collection of other books on the booth though. Will you sell 100? What about 50? That gets you $240...<br/><br/>SCENARIO 3<br/>A Design Matters model is another potential solution. We all pay an equal share of the booth, which for 7 people, say, would be $360. To make a profit I need to get back my $360 booth fee plus the cost of any books. If I sell fewer books (50, say, like 3:16 did on the DM booth in 2008) at $20 then we have $1k in the pot. If we all do equally well (and that's a big if) then we all get $1k out, which gives me a profit of $440 (i.e. almost the same as IPR) by selling half as many books. In fact, as long as the payout is above $560 (i.e. the booth makes $4k) I'm not losing money. Other effects of a booth like this are that I have a bigger and more personal presence on the con floor. The money back might be more than you personally contributed or it might be lower. I like to think of it as insurance. We're all in a hole for $2.5k and the first aim is to get out of the hole together. It's best served by matching people up with the right books rather than just pushing _my_ book. We've shown that you can make money at GenCon and you can be mutually supportive.<br/><br/>SCENARIO 4<br/>The booth takes a cut of something other than a fixed 44%. What if everyone just got a flat percentage taken out of their sales to cover the booth cost? For Design Matters this year we'd have all paid about 50% of our sales as "booth fee" if we'd done this. Note that this %age is higher than the return from IPR.<br/><br/>SCENARIO 5<br/>We all equally pay for the booth and take what we can make. In my view this model is hurt by the varying numbers of sales. People burned one year with low sales simply won't chip-in the following year to be burned again. It can also be a bitter experience when booth mates make wildly different amounts of money. One booth mate gets $100 on a $300 buy in (and is out of pocket by at least $200), while another gets well over a grand and skips cheerfully away.<br/><br/>SCENARIO 6<br/>Someone kindly lets me put my book on their booth and gives me 100% of my sales. What's in it for them? It might just be that we do this for community effort, personal friendship or to ensure a great book is present for sale on the con floor. This is the awesome scenario but I'd contend that it's not a long-term solution. It also works best for small numbers of books. I doubt anywhere is just going to allow me to sell 100 books and get all $2k year after year. GenCon (rightly, IMHO) wants its cut. Is that cut paid by whoever has the booth (IPR) or by me being part of a booth (Design Matters)? Or some other solution?<br/><br/>Any other ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286059/#Comment_286059" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T09:33:47+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  9:33AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A variation on scenario 4: Everyone pays 50% out of sales above and beyond the cost of the booth\u2014 for the entire duration of the convention. That money is evenly split Design Matters style. It was fantastic that the sales numbers were so monetarily close this year between the shares, but something like that would provide a cushion on years with a breakaway hit (like 3:16) while still providing a bit of comfort for people unsure how their games will be received.<br/><br/>You could also do fundraising for the booth, I guess?

(I won't say the exact arrangement, although I'd like to, because I haven't checked whether Simon would like it made public.)<br/><br/>The "What in it for them?" was: I knew their products very well; I'd written some of them and so was available to talk to fans about them; and I'm quite good at selling stuff. So it's a little more than altruism.<br/><br/>More generally, I think building a partnership with a bigger company is an interesting possibility.

Danielle approached us long after the window for buying into the booth was closed, and proposed a deal where it basically wouldn't cost us anything to host her books (she had them delivered, and would have any unsold stock picked up/shipped back on her own tab). Kevin and I figured that having it at the booth would drive some foot traffic, between it's Diana Jones and Indie RPG awards nominations. So it was a mutualism+supporting a worthy title+hope of a halo effect, on our part.<br/><br/>That said, it's not something we want to make a part of the model! On our end, it's nice and we were happy to do it, but it's hard to tell whether Kagematsu sold other games for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286080/#Comment_286080" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T10:16:34+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 10:16AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the initial breakdown, Gregor.  That's really helpful as a starting point.<br/><br/>Some semi-practical thoughts:<br/><br/>-- getting the booth to pay for itself some other way is definitely something I'd be interested in, whether it's through Kickstarter or selling spiffy DM booth t-shirts beforehand, or teaming up with a larger publisher or what have you; maybe the booth contributors team up on a short-run, limited edition product that they sell in the 6 months leading up to the con, as a way of paying for the booth beforehand.  Like a Pirate Jenny anthology or something.  But maybe using publishing to fund publishing is a dangerous prospect.<br/><br/>-- with non-GenCon conventions, which are more flexible about rules on selling, I keep wondering if going without a booth is a really legitimate option.  Can you sell 50-100 copies of a game out of your backpack, without a booth?  At Dreamation?  At PAX?  At JiffyCon?  At GPNW?  How would you do that?<br/><br/>Some more radical thoughts:<br/><br/>-- could you give 50-100 copies of your game away and then request that folks send you money (after the con) for whatever enjoyment they get out of it or pass it on to someone they thought would enjoy it?  I'm thinking this could actually work for short, sweet games in the Lady Blackbird tradition.  Could you get your game included in the GenCon giveaway bags, so that everybody has it, without even going to your booth?<br/><br/>I'm also potentially interested, as some of this indicates, in ideas about launching your game somewhere other than GenCon, but that may be another thread.  I'm generally interested in ways to do your initial release so that you get as much exposure as possible while maximizing your resources (including money that you could put into future print runs, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286087/#Comment_286087" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T10:28:55+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 10:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you had a product which was only offered in physical form, and only for sale at conventions.

We couldn't lose money out of any of those deals. The bare minimum was no books sold and we made no money. But we were never going to be out of pocket.<br/><br/>Anytime you buy into a booth there is the risk you lose money on it. So, having a retailer carry your stuff in return for a cut of the sale is a valid method.<br/><br/>Jonathan, I have a cool plan to distribute a game for free too. However, part of the cost that I have to factor in is the distribution. Dragonmeet in the UK charged (when I last enquired) to have promo material put into the bags for attendees. I strongly suspect GenCon is the same. For Dragonmeet we sponsored the convention at a low level and we got stuff in the bag that way, but it still cost money.<br/><br/>At Design Matters we carried Marc Majcher's 24 Game Poems this year, Mecha Quickstart last year, and Geiger Counter in 2008 as freebies.

Could you get your game included in the GenCon giveaway bags, so that everybody has it, without even going to your booth?</blockquote>\nFor Gen Con this year, it cost $800 to put stuff in the goodie bag, and $600 to put it in the coupon book (the other low-cast high-eyeball option).

You could do a similar thing with an RPG. Remember how D&amp;D modules used to be staple-bound books with a loose cardstock cover? So maybe the full game is polybagged and included in the swag bag, along with a mail-in form that offers to send you the cover (with the map or play board printed on the inside) for $X.

I guess this treads on getting-paid-to-demo.  There might be a market for rando people to get a game on with the game's creator.

People don't know where you are, who you are, or if you're even selling. Buying an item shouldn't be a goose chase. At a smaller con (like recess) it might work better, but at a behemoth like Gen Con your never going to do the numbers you would with the same game at a booth. (this is my opinion, but i'm pretty comfortable assuming i'm correct)<br/><br/>\u2022 Design Matters, despite it's commune-ist methods has always been about making money. Nathan and I invite designers to the booth who we think have games that are a good fit, and up front say that you might not make money. The potential exists with a profit share model for the people who aren't selling well to swallow up your share of the earnings. We've had very good designers with very good games not participate with us for this reason (and we hold nothing against them for it, they made the right decision). If someone asked to join up with the booth and had a freemarket on their hands (a big splashy game with a high price point), we would turn them away, because they would get hosed. Profit sharing isn't for everyone, it only works in carefully tuned situations. Nathan and I aren't experts in this. We've done it for a few years now and i think we're just getting the swing of it. The booth has never lost money, but i'm sure at some point some designers have left cash on the table. <br/><br/>\u2022 The reason we (design matters) picked up Kagematsu this year is because we figured that it's a good fit, with some press excitement, it's an honestly great game, and it wouldn't hurt us to have it. The choice was based on the merit of the product, and it's saleability. We figured it would bring some traffic and it may have. When we say that we don't know if it did, we only mean we don't have a way to track that data. Having kagematsu was a net gain for the booth.<br/><br/>\u2022 People can complain about the cut IPR takes from their sales at Gen Con, but there are ENORMOUS intangible benefits to being sold at that booth. The biggest being that it is a destination. people who aren't reading this board, and who have no interest in being a part of our community know about that booth and look forward to shopping at it once a year. Getting your game in front of those eyeballs is hard. Yeah, you might be making less money per sale, but you'll be getting waaaay more potential sales. And your game is getting into the minds of future buyers. Even the folks who went to IPR this year just to pick up dresden (and there were a lot) took a look around. That's the seed of a future sale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286146/#Comment_286146" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T12:26:52+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 12:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2010 12:28PM by wundergeek.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I'd love to see more Pirate Jenny-type booths spring up. Indie booths don't have to be all the usual suspects! Getting five or six people to split the costs of a booth and sell games is a great way to do it. People who came to Pirate Jenny in 2009 said that they were really happy that our small catalog (12 games) made us able to be really knowledgeable about each and every game on our shelves. Now, granted, what we discovered is that the way we did it wasn't really economically viable for those of us who didn't have new games. But there's no reason why a bunch of people releasing games in a given year couldn't organize a booth as a one-off and do well - especially if the Indie Booth Map becomes a tradition.<br/><br/>(We're definitely leaving the door open for future Pirate Jennys, btw.)<br/><br/>EDIT: I should add that the way we did it, people paid for shares of the booth, but we took home the profits from our own games. No profit sharing for us.

GenCon attendees are usually the "alpha gamer/product evangelist" of their local gaming scenes.     Getting those eyeballs on your product is GOLD.     Every sale to a customer like that is usually worth another 2 to 3 sales from their local scene  (although admittedly, this is only useful if your product is available to that scene through some sort of distribution).<br/><br/>The money spent on the convention is ad dollars spent in a high-return targeted marketing effort reaching thousands of gamers, and not just those at the show.    The sales you make at the show act as a way to ameliorate your costs a bit.<br/><br/><br/>Eventually it pays off -- you either have a hit product that acts as a windfall, or you grow your audience over time and increase overall sales.     It's a long game.<br/><br/><br/>Most of the "trad" publishers operate on this model -- the convention as a marketing expense, not expected to break even.     More than a few I spoke with this year indicated that GenCon 2010 was the first show that was "in the black" for them in years (and in some cases, ever.).<br/><br/>Just a thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286177/#Comment_286177" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T13:32:55+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  1:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>especially if the Indie Booth Map becomes a tradition.</blockquote>\nI think having many booths with different products and business models can only really help us all in the end.

This cut down on my expenses to a ridiculous degree, since the convention covered all of my transportation expenses and gave me a free exhibitor's booth (which it should be noted is different from--and dramatically easier to get than--a dealers room booth) and five badges for other cohorts. Between bad planning, bad timing, and bad health I wasn't able to take advantage of the opportunity anywhere near as much as I would've liked. (Nothing to sell, no sales tax permit if we did, and I was exhausted, coughing, and anxious the whole time.)<br/><br/>Still, there are quite a few people in this community who could fanagle their way into being a guest of honor at any number of conventions (which can happen by networking and just plain asking).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286233/#Comment_286233" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T18:07:53+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  6:07PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thought for the pack would be to just work a deal out with gencon to pay less since your taking no room up.

Leave out a copy of each book on the table to see whats for sale and the twitter id for people to follow.</li>\n<li>have the rest of the people follow a single path where they hang out and chit chat with people about games and sell.</li>\n<li>Be equipped with custom logo shirts and back packs, and smart phones for credit card processing.

I was just thinking of flash mobs and street vendors.<br/><br/>I'm definitely <i>not </i>advocating breaking expressed GenCon regulations.  It might be worth suggesting to GenCon planners that indie designers are a key part of the convention, but that booth space is prohibitively expensive.  Perhaps suggest a system where you could pay a smaller sum (e.g.$100/day) to get a mobile vendor shirt allowing you to sell up to 100 units and that you must be able to carry all stock on your person.  <br/><br/>Another option might be to pool resources to rent a conference room in a nearby hotel.  Then you could hand out fliers directing people to that conference room any night (e.g.6pm-8pm) to purchase copies, get autographs, and meet and greet the designers.  Many companies hold these private expos in separate venues at conferences I've been to.  <br/><br/>You could also, probably, make more of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game" rel="nofollow">alternate reality game</a> in which people collect clues by meeting people in specific shirts.  Those people would then provide clues that lead to an off site purchase location.  You could then seed some people to hype the games and then tell people how to get an initial clue.

This past Gen Con, a half booth was $375 and a display in the GPA Showcase was $150. The Showcase doesn't even require you to be on site. Most of the participants often just ship the product in and the GPA sells it for them. The participating company gets all the proceeds, minus 10% for each Credit Card transaction. So, even if you can't be at GenCon, you product can be.<br/><br/>The GPA does this not just with GenCon, but also with Origins and Gama Trade Show. The advantage is that the GPA is able to negotiate as a group to get advantagous postioning on the dealer floor, and usually a bit of a discount to the booth fees. The Showcase isn't conducted at GTS, since it is an industry show, the point is to make contact with sellers, and not actually sell product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286253/#Comment_286253" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T22:10:17+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 10:10PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>electronic gaming split this year, but instead of using that space to create booths and reduce overall cost for all attendees... they created huge idle areas, walk-thru areas, etc.</blockquote>\nMy guess is that this was a last-minute thing (the draft exhibit hall map I used to make the indie games map in July included the electronic space) and they didn't have time to make a new plan or get new booth buy-ins.  But yeah, I see your point.

Once you got an order, people could show you their driver's license and pick up their copy.

It means you <i>make less</i> on that qty of copies you sell that you otherwise would not have sold, and if you sell enough through that channel to offset a larger (read:cheaper) print run, you do BETTER on those copies you sell direct. Gregor has the right idea, for sure: have the product in several places, where it can get seen by people besides those inclined to stop in at DM... the presence of 3:16 n the C7 booth meant that a whole army of Dr Who fans walked past it who may never even have gotten to the 'Indie' side of the hall.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286334/#Comment_286334" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T13:59:27+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  1:59PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite>I've never been to gen con, and I still want to go, but between the new-to-me fact that it costs<i>one thousand sixteen fucking hundred dollars</i>to get a booth and the fact that you have to<i>pay to play games</i>(apparently?

Your cost per attendee at GenCon is totally in line with the industry given the attendance, and probably on the cheap side. (A $1600 booth at GenCon when they get 30K unique attendees is about the same as a $50 booth at a con that draws a thousands attendees, and any con that size will have booths in the several hundred dollar range)<br/><br/>Every regional gamer Con I attend all charge separate fees for individual events. It's hardly a unique-to-GenCon phenomenon. Your admission gets you into the show, seminars, dealer hall, etc. Specific events require an extra payment, which is fine. It's been that way for years, and it's not like they don't explain exactly how it all breaks out in advance.

Here in Finland you could basically buy the entire dealer's hall for yourself in the largest convention of the country for the cost of a small Gencon booth, if the exhibitor fees were real and not just token payments. Any other convention, and I'll walk in there without paying a cent. Getting visitors to pay for events would be sheer fantasy. Conventions are routinely financed by utilizing rent-free or heavily subvented public locations. It's a totally different paradigm that is in my understanding pretty common in some other countries as well, so I'm not surprised a bit that some would find the terms Gencon gives you sucky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286340/#Comment_286340" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T15:02:28+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  3:02PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2010 3:04PM by Hans_c-o.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite>I've never been to gen con, and I still want to go, but between the new-to-me fact that it costs<i>one thousand sixteen fucking hundred dollars</i>to get a booth and the fact that you have to<i>pay to play games</i>(apparently?

Your cost per attendee at GenCon is totally in line with the industry given the attendance, and probably on the cheap side. (A $1600 booth at GenCon when they get 30K unique attendees is about the same as a $50 booth at a con that draws a thousands attendees, and any con that size will have booths in the several hundred dollar range)<br/><br/>Every regional gamer Con I attend all charge separate fees for individual events. It's hardly a unique-to-GenCon phenomenon. Your admission gets you into the show, seminars, dealer hall, etc. Specific events require an extra payment, which is fine. It's been that way for years, and it's not like they don't explain exactly how it all breaks out in advance. Most of these shows simply wouldn't happen if they had to make their entire nut just on admissions and vendor sales.<br/><br/>-Jim C.<br/><br/>Jim, that makes sense, and thanks for the explanation. I'm coming from only attending GPNW, Gamestorm, and Conquest NW, where I just pay an entry fee and then play all the hell I want. These are regional gamer cons and don't charge separate fees for individual events (though, to be fair, GPNW is its own beast). I don't think Gen Con is ripping people off*, but it's kind of a shock to think about being charged to play games beyond an entry fee.<br/><br/><br/>*well, like, they're just making the money they need to to stay alive, so that's not ripping people off. But just looking at gaming @ Gen Con vs. gaming @ Gamestorm or GPNW, yeah, it's a ripoff. But then I don't think you really go to Gen Con primarily to play games, so it's not a real comparison.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286341/#Comment_286341" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T15:57:35+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  3:57PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite><cite>Posted By: Keith Sears</cite><br/>Since I am on the GPA Board of Directors, I can answer this question.<br/><br/>A full membership for a year is $75.

I am rubbish at selling, and I'm not proud of that - selling things you believe in is a noble calling. Graham also produced some delicious print versions of his PDF Trail of Cthulhu adventures which covered their total print costs. All in all it was a reasonable arrangement; he knew our products and sold them; likewise, other booth staff would promote and explain his games where appropriate.<br/><br/>I think this year is the first year that Pelgrane just about broke even, exclusing any notional amount for my preparation time - ProFantasy usually makes a modest amount, or when a major new release occurs makes a profit. The only problem with considering it a marketing expense is that it makes one inclined to be less focused on breaking even or making a profit.<br/>I do remember when we launched Dying Earth and sold many copies - but as we had only one product, there was no way we would break even - if you are introducing a new game, it may well make sense to view it as a marketing expense.<br/><br/>This year, the demo area was a very expensive waste of space; Steve and Graham demo'ed games elsewhere for the most part and I would have been better off spending the resources on ensuring the games where in the main program and at Games on Demand.<br/><br/>I have always avoided going for exclusivity, although at Origins there was a dealer who had got hold of a large stock of old-sih ProFantasy stuff and was selling it at $5 a piece, so I'm not so sure for the software.<br/><br/>One potential outlet which people overlook are the retailers; I usually sell a few hundred dollars' worth to retailers at the trade show, and one retailer expressed an interest in Graham's stuff on sight - they are definintely worth approaching, even if it's just to place a couple of copies with a pro-active retailer.<br/><br/>One big success at the con which certainly increased sales, and that was giving PDFs away with the print version through our POS software. People didn't mind waiting for their orders to be entered and then supplying their email addresses in order to get a PDF of every product. It builds a direct connection with the customers, and provides an incentive to buy at the convention. It also ties in with the level playing field we are building with the Bits and Mortar initiative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286715/#Comment_286715" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T10:12:51+00:00" title="August 16, 2010 10:12AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>Andy: This is awesome, but sadly not all of us have games like Misery Bubblegum or Maid that would do equally well at an anime convention as a gaming convention. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Seriously, though, good luck with that.

What I can say for certain is that there's a definite overlap between RPGs and anime fandom, and D&amp;D probably gets more at anime cons play than, say, BESM these days, and that's before we get to cons like A-Kon that specifically branch out to tabletop gaming (amongst other things). Showing off how to give a game an anime spin would definitely be a good idea though. Although you can't hope to please some of the picky and acutely negative anime bloggers or anything, it pays to keep in mind that anime fans tend to have a definite aesthetic sense, so aesthetic authenticity is something to strive for with that demographic.<br/><br/>There are also plenty of other non-gaming cons that could be a potential market for RPGs and attract similarly fresh eyes. Science fiction, fantasy, and horror conventions spring to mind, and those are just the obvious nerdy ones. I have an acquaintance who's working on a steampunk RPG and contemplating trying to sell it at a steampunk convention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286739/#Comment_286739" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T11:01:26+00:00" title="August 16, 2010 11:01AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>so aesthetic authenticity is something to strive for with that demographic.</blockquote>\nLayman's translation: Don't pay bottom dollar for shitty art.

The principal advantage for the con organizer appears to be that they can track participation in each event separately, and figure out which games were popular (and, in a more punitive vein, which GMs actually showed up to run events). Gen Con apparently still runs according to this model.<br/><br/>A lot of other cons looked at the paperwork and bureaucracy and said, "We could charge $25 plus $3 a slot, but it's much less work to charge a flat-fee $45."  This is the model that Go Play Northwest uses.  <br/><br/>(Of course, alter numbers to suit local costs, production values, inflation, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12722/selling-via-booths-selling-your-game-at-gencon" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12722/selling-via-booths-selling-your-game-at-gencon" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12722/selling-via-booths-selling-your-game-at-gencon/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12722%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12722%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
