                    I think it's a pretty well know fact here that traditional RPGs usually don't have stated and properly expressed player goals or win conditions. This is why they are considered by many to be not 'games' but 'toys'.<br/><br/>Since Forge we are getting better at this, so RPGs and Story Games could be more 'gamey' now. They are more 'complete', less 'flexible' than D&amp;D. Examples: <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/805" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/805</a><br/><br/>When someone tells us that (s)he didnt enjoy a particular well known favourite RPG, the standard accusation of 'you were playing it wrong!' is common and usually wrong because it blames only the player. <br/><br/>What is just realized is that if you are new to D&amp;D and try to learn it, even if you don't really know how to do it, it's possible that you will have (some kind of weird) fun. Do you remember your old days playing a muchkin as a kid trying to understand the rulebook? Also, if you already mastered D&amp;D, you can play it in a lot of different ways, and it's still fun. It's because of it's 'toyness'.<br/><br/>But when you play Fiasco the first time, and you are an experienced roleplayer, you have to use very different skills (improv attitudes and techniques), and also, if you try to play the game different than the rules and guidlines imply, there's a bigger change that it's gonna suck. Games are more 'rigid' so to speak than toys, so they break easier.<br/><br/>So maybe 'playing it wrong' is a real danger considering a small part of RPGs.<br/><br/>It's just an argument and maybe I'm not right but I feel that I'm into somethings. What do you think?                </div>

                            Maybe I'm old and cranky, but you can totally "play it wrong."  Any given RPG -- even "broad" old ones like D&amp;D -- is going to have things that it does well, and things that it does poorly, and if you take a game and try to do a thing that it does poorly with it (Try to run Game of Thrones style intrigue in D&amp;D, try to do anything in Shadowrun, etc.) (This is a joke. To some extent), you are "playing it wrong". <br/><br/>Though to be fair, I don't usually say "You are playing it wrong" -- at least, not for a GM'd game.  For GM'd games, I tend to (rightly or wrongly) lay the blame for it at the feet of the GM.  And if the person complaining IS the GM, then I tend to say something like "It sounds like you made some errors."                        </div>

I think it's an implicit goal but yes, it's strong. Lot of people felt is and it was put upfront by the OSR movement and other, more gamist approaches. Still a lot of D&amp;D groups played and plays the game without giving much attention to XP. Just remember the 'You level up when I say that' type of GM where the party automatically levels up at a point in the story and it's given, it's nothing to struggle for.

I agree and disagree. Even if D&amp;D rules dont support GoT style (they don't), the rules only consider a small portion of reality (fight, skill checks, etc), so you can easily inject guidlines and principles which help intrigue gaming. It would not be perfect (or good enough for me), but this is what was done historically, and some people had fun, other's got frustrated (me).<br/>I dont think that games like Fiasco, Annalise etc. are more complete, more structured and more rigid than D&amp;D. They have principles and preferred playstyle baked inside them.

Yes. You could make a game (and I guess there are some games like that) which uses collaborative techniques but no stated playstyle. You still need to know how to improv but they are more flexible than Fiasco. They are just like D&amp;D with a different type of basic skillset.                        </div>

                            I've never understood the argument about "focused games" being stricter and more rigid than D&amp;D. I think people have a variety of experiences with D&amp;D out of necessity - most of us played it at some point as "the only game we have", and therefore try to experiment - but I think that most "focused" games have the same possibility for flexibility. Perhaps they are better at presenting the goals of play, but the rules and structures themselves are no more restrictive or prohibitive.<br/><br/>Those people who say that "D&amp;D can do anything" often rave about having sessions of play where no one referenced a character sheet or rolled any dice. <br/><br/>Well, I see absolutely no reason I couldn't do that just as easily in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> [or insert your own favourite "focused" game here].                        </div>

                            All the hacks of a given storygame, where mechanics are more or less preserved, form a family of games. That family of games really isn't different than how D&amp;D, as a broad phenomenon, presents. (In other words, we can think of D&amp;D as actually encompassing a range of more substantive games, based in playstyle and agenda and principles and local factors and so forth.)<br/><br/>People play D&amp;D in a bunch of different ways, and call it the same game; people play a bunch of closely related storygame hacks and call them different games. Not so different in the broader view, though. D&amp;D is just allowed to encompass a broader range of actual games. That's partially baked into the texts--a lot of storygames do a better job defining or priming a particular play experience--but it's not intrinsic to D&amp;D itself.                        </div>

Absent ignoring the rules (i.e. never referencing them or rolling dice, as you say) I don't see this.<br/><br/>D&amp;D's six ability scores alone provide a broad simulationist chassis which can be used to (superficially) run just about anything.<br/><br/>I can imagine using D&amp;D to run the minions' rebellion in <i>My Life with Master</i> but I cannot imagine using MLwM to run a dungeon crawl.<br/><br/>But I'll concede that this is probably just me, stuck in my ways. So, seriously, what might a MLwM dungeon crawl look like (i.e. what are the characters afraid of that empowers them etc.)?                        </div>

I think the resolution in DitV is fairly general so yes, I agree. The setting and intended playstyle is not baked into the mechanics. But I was thinking about games like MLwM as <a href="/forums/profile/Johann">@Johann</a> said and not every story game.<br/><br/>I like <a href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">@Stephen P</a> argument. Maybe the whole thing is about the culture. As someone said it in another thread, a big set of gamers consider the rules to be a fallback option. I think that it's the consequence of toyness. Others (like me) favor 'complete' games where sticking to the rules is the main thing.                        </div>

                            My Life with Master is, admittedly, a fairly extreme case.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I still think that there is some D&amp;D blindness going on here. MLwM characters are creatures like a young girl who can only speak to children and can hear the reality of any lie when in the moonlight.<br/><br/>I'd love to see you create her as a character in, say, D&amp;D4th or 5th. It won't exactly be smooth sailing!<br/><br/>At the very least, you'll have to change the XP rules dramatically, since she won't be killing dragons anytime soon.<br/><br/>The rules of D&amp;D constrain the types of characters you can play so fundamentally (race, class, level, and expected progression) that most types of narratives are simply impossible without some serious hacking. <br/><br/>Do you want to make a list of last year's major films or tv shows and see what proportion seem like they could be easily recreated in D&amp;D's framework? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In contrast, changing the genre of MLwM is almost effortless. Reason and Fear and Love and similar things are fundamental elements of being human, broadly applicable to almost any story.<br/><br/>"More than human and less than human" could be used to describe a variety of protagonists ("Dorothy from Kansas, who has more heart than anyone around her").<br/><br/>Bonus dice from Intimacy and Desperation are far more broadly applicable than "you deal double damage if you have an advantage bonus from flanking", and so forth. <br/><br/>In the same way that we might throw out the XP system, I can see redifining what the MLwM endgame means. Perhaps it's Neo and the rebels fighting against their robot overlords, for example? <br/><br/>Or the endgame determines whether two lovers can overcome their Self-Loathing enough to finally be together, with the Master being a metaphor for a past dysfunctional relationship?<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, of course, it's about culture and presentation.<br/><br/>I'm exaggerating a tiny bit here in my post, to make the point, but I don't think I'm totally off the mark. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>D&amp;D marketed itself as "you can do anything!" and people tried to do so. <br/><br/>Modern "story games" encourage you to use them for specific goals and then to pick up another game for different types of fun.<br/><br/>But MLwM is a game about minions trying to forge human connections overcome their horrible Master, and D&amp;D is a game about a very specific type of fantasy heroes fighting monsters and collecting treasure. They're both highly "focused" compared to something like GURPS or The Pool or Archipelago. But it's not those games people hold up as exemplars of "you can do abything!" - it's D&amp;D. I'd argue that can only be due to history.                        </div>

As soon as you start doing anything that's not about combat and somehow still getting XP, you're ignoring the D&amp;D rules too.  And if you're doing stuff that's not about combat and not getting XP, you're barely using the D&amp;D rules, so...

                            Isn't the ability to "make D&amp;D do whatever you want" more of a point in favor of the people doing so than the game itself? I mean hasn't that been historically how it was often presented? "With a good enough GM" or "with the right group"? Like Paul says, the fact that this is primarily attributed to D&amp;D has more to do with history, its outsize position in the gamer consciousness, etc... than any mechanical aspect of the game. For better or (usually) for worse, broad pronouncements about RPGs in general are often just about D&amp;D, with the expectation that they will apply universally, to the point that some people's definitions of what are and are not RPGs might as well be based on how well those broad pronouncements can apply to them.<br/><br/>Whether or not you can run MLwM as an erotically charged sexventure (okay, likely actually easier than a challenge-based dungeon crawl, but I love that line and will use it whenever I get the chance) probably has as much to do with the people who are interested in the game in the first place (people who like focused Forgist design, people who don't want to do the fiddly work of modifying games to do something else, and cetera) as it does with whether there's anything inherent in the game itself that makes that an easy or difficult task. I don't think it's hard to imagine people doing that in a world where for whatever reason MLwM is their only exposure to the idea of roleplaying games.                        </div>

Respectfully, I disagree, and I cite the OSR as exhibit A;  They took rules that were, frankly, languishing and derided, and added nothing except properly expressed goals and now they are a tremendously successful style of play.

<br/>With the OSR, everyone's experience is pretty different. I ended up going back to the original stuff and taking what worked for me (just in terms of adventure structure and playstyle) because I was tired of things like Encounter Levels and adventures that felt too railroady. I don't represent the OSR though, so you'll have to ask prominent people in the movement what they think lead to its success. I think your assessment is off though (or at least I think it pivots on my point about 'properly expressed player goals' somewhat disingenuously. So many people arrived at that place independently, simply by going back and playing and reading the old game books again. I don't think it was clear player goals that made the OSR successful. The OSR means so many different things depending on who you ask. I think what made it successful was an approach that demanded stuff that actually worked at the table (not just in theory), an emphasis on rulings over rules, and a 'don't throw the baby out with the bath water' approach to the original books. It was also partly a realization that you could customize stuff to taste.                         </div>

                            I find the contention that a lack of expressed player goals is a feature of "classic RPG" play/design pretty interesting.<br/><br/>Most notably, it seems to omit D&amp;D itself, which generally has a very clear sense of player goals (unless groups adopt an Illusionist playstyle, of course, in which case things get much more muddled). <br/><br/>I'd agree that's true for other games, however.<br/><br/>(I like your list of OSR culture "features", that makes a ton of sense.

Just because "lack of properly expressed goals" is a feature of one game/playstyle doesn't mean that "clearly expressed goals" can't be a feature of another.                        </div>

                            I'd recommend everyone to notice that you all are thinking more in the game in your heads instead of the game as written. <br/><br/>The game in your head is a perfectly polished gem of versatility optimized to do whatever you want it to do, which suits both you and your group expectations.<br/><br/>Let's say the game in your head is D&amp;D, any edition. Then I'm pretty sure you will be able to make it do anything using the core resolution system and the attributes. XP will be absent or more related to whatever your group feels is the appropiate goal for the genre. There's no way to "play wrong" the game in your head, so the question there becomes absurd.<br/><br/>The matter then becomes a statistical one: how many people have managed to make a good enough version of D&amp;D in their minds so they can do the same as you? Given the amount of heartbreakers and story games derived from D&amp;D since the forge days, I'd say that not enough to call it a perfectly clear game, nor a versatile enough toy.<br/><br/>There's the matter of betrayed expectations too. Like, those who played 2e or 3-3.5e thinking the game was the perfect engine to "immerse in worlds of adventure", when actually those worlds of adventure were mostly limited to dungeons and railroaded adventures... which happen mostly whenever a GM lacks the skills to make the game sing.<br/>But if your expectations about "worlds of adventure" were exactly dungeon crawling, killing monsters and railroaded adventures, you'd say the the game meet your expectations, that it made your dreams come true.<br/><br/>So, going back to the blame: it will depend more on peoples perceptions, tastes and expectatives and less in strong, logic and objective reasons. Some would blame the book for not being clear enough, some will blame the GM or the players for misreading and playing it wrong and they will be right from their experience and wrong according to other people's experience.<br/><br/>Not to say that an RPG can't be played wrong. If you didn't have any fun and others did, that says something. Not that an RPG can't be poorly explained. If somebody explained it to you and the second run felt more like a fun game, that should be the reason. Can it be a poor design? If you hacked it a bit and you felt like it got fixed, of course that the problem was the design. It could even be the wrong expectations. My personal experience with the OSR made me understand that I was expecting a power fantasy in D&amp;D where our DM was pushing for a more lethal playstyle. You can have both in D&amp;D depending on how the DM handles the game, but if you expect one and are given the other without explanations, you will probably blame the DM or the game as I did.<br/><br/>Of course, it remains a personal reccomendation: step back a bit and try to realize that arguments here are all subjective, dependant on personal experiences. There's still a good discussion here but it runs the risk of falling prey of getting heated for misunderstandings.<br/><br/>Sorry for the wall of text.<br/><br/> </div>

I think the idea of "badwrongfun" is a mischaracterization of a broad and nuanced range of criticisms, advice, and games designed in reaction to perceived problematic practices and designs.<br/><br/>I also suspect this question is asked somewhat in bad faith: "does playing MLwM or Fiasco or Swords Without Master still fun if you are playing it wrong?" Maybe there's a language barrier issue here, but it seems very obvious to me that you can break the rules of a game and still have fun with it, so this seems like a leading question.<br/>To be clear: fun is about personal tastes rather than necessarily being a product of apparently ethical play.<br/><br/>It might also be worth addressing the idea that the overriding point of play <i>is fun</i>. It can be and often is, but I'd suggest the point of play is whatever experience the game is designed to create. The fact that you find one or more of those experiences fun or that people consistently design games to create experiences that are commonly found to be fun is more of a cultural thing. Games can also (by design) create confrontation, cause unpleasantness, teach, train, generate catharsis, or have other therapeutic effects.<br/><br/>I only go into that to make it very clear that playing something the "right" or "wrong" way doesn't necessarily hinge on fun. And, in my experience, it's very rare for someone to say you're playing something "wrong" apropos of nothing. Especially in the context of a forum like this, "wrong" play is almost always discussed in reaction to openly declared play problems or experiences that seem to stray from or violate the known range of experiences for a given game. It's not about judging a game, class of games, player, group, or anything like that; but, rather, about troubleshooting.<br/><br/>You can have a lot of fun but still encounter trouble and examine that. And because of the nature of rpgs/story games as a creative activity, there's usually plenty of room for creative differences and rule-agnostic practices that uniquely shape experiences as well as troubles.<br/>I think I'm with <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> in that I'm not sure that D&amp;D actually has more room for those creative differences and practices than any other game or your average "indie" game. But it makes sense to say that the <i>traditions</i> of D&amp;D have heavily focused on that space. However, it's entirely possible that's due to many things that aren't related to the rules in the first place.                        </div>

                            I think the counterarguments are good so I try to restate my insight more moderately:<br/><br/>RPGs (D&amp;D historically, FATE Core, etc.) which go for universal acclaim usually try to advertize themselves as multifunctional toys what can be used in a lot of different way. They usually achieve it with universal resolution systems, setting neutrality and opaque player goals/win conditions. RPGs with strong color and 'completeness' often try to create an image of uniqueness and nicheness with opposite tools.<br/><br/>The truth seems to be that both category of RPGs could be easily hacked into something else, but that doesn't meant that everything is equally good for everything!<br/><br/>When you play a trad game where player goals, agendas and the object of game is not clear and pre-stated/agreed, the problems and conflicts often materalize like this: 'you are a jerk!' / 'you are playing to wrong!' Actually the only thing that happened is that someone radically (and often blindly) diverged from the unsaid resulant of the other's expectations which they have brought to the table.<br/><br/>When you play a shiny structured game where the object of it is much more transparent (sometimes it's shoved into your face!), the divergence is more often seen as a transgression of the game itself. But maybe that's a false dichotomy, it's still about the clashes of different expectations which stem from the individual internalization of the game's vision.                        </div>

                            Agreed that clash between participants is largely about the expectations they took in.<br/><br/>I think a game like Fiasco, which does one thing and pitches that one thing, has pretty good odds of getting everyone on the same page.  Not perfect odds, though!  Some players might slavishly emulate Coen Brothers films, others might not have seen them at all, and some might take "this is an RPG" to mean very different things (e.g. in terms of third-person description vs character acting).  The hope, I'd say, is that with a narrow enough range of expectations, the likelihood of fun-ruining clash, as opposed to other sorts of differences, is reasonably small.  You can describe your scenes and I can act out mine and we can still play together.  We may even adapt to each other's play styles somewhat, as long as we're all reasonably assured of getting the whole "powerful ambition, poor impulse control" thing that we signed up for.<br/><br/>Of course, if one person owns the Fiasco book and has their take on the game, and they introduce it to the other players, then that group is going to get that person's take.<br/><br/>I think D&amp;D is similar in that last respect.  If the DM takes a vision about what D&amp;D is to their table, and communicates that, and all of the players opt in, then cool, we should all be able to play together just fine.  Or, even if the DM doesn't pitch and communicate everything up front, the players can still look to the DM and learn through play what kind of game this is.<br/><br/>I think the biggest problems arise when the players bring in conflicting expectations and when the DM fails to establish consistent expectations.  That's when you can get everyone pulling in <i>vastly</i> different directions.<br/><br/>Some roleplayers would blame the DM for that, others would blame the whole group, and others would blame the D&amp;D book itself, for not better facilitating expectation-setting.<br/><br/>Personally, I wish almost <i>all</i> RPGs provided better "get everyone on the same page" tools.  (Though I do think it's least necessary in games that very obviously occupy very specific niches.)<br/><br/>As far as "playing wrong", to me that means violating the expectations that you agreed to.  Or refusing to agree and playing anyway.  If no one at the table knows what the expectations <i>are</i>, then I guess no one is playing wrong... or <i>everyone</i> is.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Re: trad vs Forgite, let me just mention that I don't think expectations need to be identical from player to player.  For instance, a DM can establish the expectation that this game cares about clever problem-solving, but allow one player to tackle that through convincing roleplay acting, another player through in-fiction physics tricks, another through rules mastery, etc.  I just think that <i>if</i> a DM is only going to allow one of those approaches to work (whether per their own preferences or per their understanding of the game rules), they'd better make that clear.  Personally, I don't enjoy play as much when everyone's looking for separate enjoyment by doing unrelated things, but I've certainly been in groups where that was the best solution.  So I certainly wouldn't advocate the sort of "everyone must be on the same page about <i>everything</i>" mandate that Forge theory implies to some.  I do like it when it's feasible, though.                        </div>

                            We hashed this over and over on the Forge years ago, no? (This is not a reply to anyone in particular.)<br/><br/>The only real "wrong" or "bad" is when the group isn't having a good time. As long as everyone is having fun, it's fine. You do you.<br/><br/>When we start to analyze RAW/text, now we're talking about the ability of the game-as-written to <i>reliably</i> produce fun experiences for player groups. If you ignore a giant chunk of the rules, or if you have to kit-bash the rules to make them work for you, then arguably you are not playing <i>that game</i>. You are playing your version of that game, which is also fine, but that game didn't produce fun without you doing that work. (Now, if that work is literally encoded into the rules as part of the game, we're in muddy territory, as we all know.)<br/><br/>The main thing that the Forge did was get people to think about games as more than just a conflict resolution system. Now game texts include tools for getting everyone on the same page and keeping them there. Now game texts explicitly count setting as part of the rules. And <i>situation</i>, thank god. Now game texts include clear procedures to tell the participants how to use the game, what to <i>do</i> when you're playing, to glue the whole experience together.<br/><br/>And anyone who thinks they can play literally anything with D&amp;D rules hasn't thought it through. They're thinking of D&amp;D as a simple task resolution chassis, but so much more is required to actually play a game. If you reduce (modern) D&amp;D to "roll a d20 and add a stat bonus and compare to a target number," you could be describing almost any game. Frankly, at that point, there are other games that do that thing better. (Savage Worlds, Fate, The Pool...)                        </div>

                            Yeah, situation is IMO the biggest determinant of how well the rules fit. <br/><br/>An example is how you can change the rules for Dogs in the Vineyard almost trivially to suit other settings as long as you keep the basic situation of lawgivers coming into fraught communities and creating order.  <br/><br/>Note that if you understand this and have players who are on board, you can get some interesting effects by creating a mismatch between the system and the setting.  For example, one of my friends on RPG.Net is running a dungeon crawl using the Delta Green rules.  <br/><br/>Now, Delta Green has no levels, no feats, and is mainly focused around investigation, short bloody combats, and getting PTSD.  So it's a lot of fun to watch these characters deal with D&amp;D tropes in somewhat realistic manner psychologically.  <br/><br/>I suppose you could do the same thing in reverse by having D&amp;D characters investigate a Mythos cult, but the D&amp;D tropes are <i>really strong</i> and it would be probably just come out as Mythos-flavored D&amp;D.                         </div>

                            I guess my point was most traditional games and traditional play styles, players are quite able to set their own goals. I am not saying the system doesn't reward things. But even something like XP varies immensely over editions, has all kinds of options for rewarding things like RP in certain editions, and gets tweaked constantly to reflect the desires of the table (and dealing with how people level is a pretty simple matter). But when I start a campaign in a traditional RPG, I don't necessarily know what the player goals are going to be. They could decide to spend all their time dungeon crawling. Could also decide to open a shop in town, explore a trade route, involve themselves in local politics, or start a goblin hunting business. And if you are speaking even more generally about player goals (focus on RP, focus on combat, focus on investigations, etc), traditional games tend to be even more open. I think that is what they discovered when they launched 4E: it was too focused on a narrow band of player goals and people rebelled. That is why 5E tried so hard to woo people back by broadening the scope of the game (because for ages people were playing these games in all kinds of different ways---often with mixes of different 'player goals' at a given table). I would still maintain, that a game's ability to flexibly handle that is a strength. In the case of D&amp;D it kind of has the best of both worlds. It has a strong core concept, but you can easily stray from that and the game itself is so easy for maintaining long term campaigns with a wide variety of goals in mind. Yes, you are always going to potentially run into the 'Cthulhu with D&amp;D' thing, but if the 'tropes' are strong, it is because they work. Again, I wasn't thinking specifically about D&amp;D even. I was just thinking in terms of traditional RPGs, and the OSR approach to play in general.                         </div>

I agree!<br/><br/>When I was into OSR stuff (2008-2012) I tended to think that compatible expectations are enough. That way we dont have clashing agendas, and everybody can do their own 'kink'. <br/><br/>But I soon realized that I was longing for mutual understanding as a DM, I wanted someone who shared my vision so we could 'build' something together. That's so much better than having a polite audience. The more we played the more some players became integrated and we tuned at each other. Also others slowly became alienated. Usually they drop out at some point but not always. I think this is the typical way how RPG groups tend to regulate themselves.                        </div>

I am not 100% sure what you mean by this, but one thing I've noted with the issue of 'what is roleplaying' at the table, is a huge gulf between the theorizing you see all around online, and what typical players want. In any given group you might have 1-2 players more keyed into that stuff, but by and large, the settlements floating around the internet on 'what is RP' and 'why are we at the table' don't seem to hold when I get a group together. So I do think a fair amount of flexibility here is also useful. At the end of the day, it is a group activity, and if you have 4 people showing up who game for 4 different reasons, you either find a middle ground/mix and match or you keep kicking people out until you have a homogenous game group. I generally RP to play a character in a setting where I can explore and interact with a world that feels real. But if someone shows up to my table and has no interest in that, and want to focus on something else, I adapt as a GM. I tend to prefer games that don't get in the way of that kind of flexibility.                         </div>

Is it possible you are being overly rigid here. I mean it is great when people are on the same page, at the same time, when I am a player, I don't insist that my approach be catered to. If the GM wants to do something more story driven or even a railroad, I'll play along. I am not there to disrupt peoples' fun, even if my ideal of fun isn't the same as everyone at the table. One benefit of this approach is I still end up having fun in the end anyways because it isn't like not having the game 100% match my preferred style cripples my enjoyment. Having fun is also something of a choice you make.                         </div>

                            There's an area where a group might or might not be having fun, but has done what I think of as breaking the warranty. This isn't bad play, you understand, but it does mean , presuming the rules are sufficiently clear, that if things go wrong, the fault does not lie with the rules.<br/><br/>Fr'ex, if you ignore the town creation rules in Dogs in the Vineyard, you've broken the warranty. We did that with a play by email game about a high school for supernatural and ordinary students, and things got very weird. The entire experience system is build solidly atop the foundation of the town creation rules.<br/><br/>Some folks from the same group tried a more traditional DitV hack, using the Firefly setting. This can totally work -- but, in my opinion, it didn't quite because another pillar of DitV was set aside: the PCs are the highest secular and spiritual authority in the game world. This wasn't the case here.<br/><br/>(There were other issues in both games, such as the difficulty of timing an online game for folks in time zones five hours apart, but those are outside the scope of this thread.)<br/><br/>Similarly, we're breaking the warranty on Night's Black Agents.<br/><br/>Player: Sure, I could play Mrs. Pat again.<br/><br/>Me: Well, if no one minds. I mean, it will make Ken Hite cry because if it were up to him --<br/><br/>All of us: No one would ever play the good vampire!<br/><br/>Player: But that's all right -- Mrs. Pat is NOT a good vampire!<br/><br/>We've not yet had the first session of this part of the campaign, so I've no idea how well it will work. But, if it crashes and burns? That's on us, not on NBA.                        </div>

                            My group and I just took the route of kicking people out until we got a homogenous group, tbh, because we found that trying to cater to interests not in-tune with ours was making our play worse and making us all unhappy. <br/>(We as in my fiancee and our girlfriend and I, who are my current group, and who are all on the same page 100% about how play should go.)<br/>The three of us are super super focused and singular in our interests, so then if someone isn't into the stuff we're doing, we feel like we have to devote time to trying to do the stuff the other person wants, and then we end up just slogging through their scenes unhappily waiting for the point where we got to get back to the stuff that interests us, and then the other person would sit around bored while we did the stuff that interested us. It was just all around a disaster, and led to big chunks of the session time being totally wasted for us by doing boring stuff we weren't interested in, when the time could have been better spent doing the stuff we cared about, if it wasn't for the people who weren't contributing to what we wanted to do.<br/>Our play improved by leaps and bounds when we decided to kick people who weren't on the same page as us as far as what they want out of play, and we generally started having so so so much more fun.                        </div>

Starting out with a mission statement is fine. The problem is when it becomes this binding decree that you can never escape from. Anytime I start a campaign I hash out with the players what they want and expect. But again, I do come back to the idea of give and take and deciding to have fun. I see way too many people convince themselves that if they don't reach this platonic ideal of play they have in their head, that they won't enjoy themselves, and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. This is just elf games after all. I am not saying the problem is never the group or the approach, but I think often times the problem has more to do with people convincing themselves they'll only have fun if they achieve an incredibly narrow preconception of play they've picked up off the internet (or from a game manual). In my experience, 9 times out of 10, if you decide to have have fun, you will. Because it is just a game. <br/> </div>

I agree 100% and I am happy that you've brought this up because I felt misunderstood upthread. The simple task resolution chassis can be used to, as I wrote, <b>superficially</b> run just about anything. A minion in MLwM makes an overture to a connection? Roll Charisma. Try to resist the Master? Make a Will save. Etc. Do you get the same experience as when actually playing MLwM? Hell, no! The particular dynamics, the focus, the endgame etc. embedded in MLwM would be lost, to the great detriment of the game.<br/><br/>Perhaps a MLwM veteran can conceive of running a dungeon crawl with similar ease. The Master? Metaphorical Greed. Etc. I lack the experience to do this, though, but I do <i>suspect</i> that MLwM is more rigid - i.e. requires more creativity, more hacking etc. - to make this even superficially viable. But feel free to correct me!                        </div>

You may have whiffed the intent here, which, I suspect, was a comment on the people who think that there is "one way to roleplay" -- not out of some sort of one-true-way-ism, because they don't even really examine it enough to grasp that there ARE other ways.  This is extremely common in people who've got a lot of roleplaying years under their belt, but have done almost all of it with the same group and generally in very trad systems.  Usually they think everything drops down to a sort of task resolution system where the GM wallpapers over any issues, and generally there's more to it, but the rest varies more depending on the playstyle of whatever the original group was.  <br/><br/>Or maybe I'm wrong and that wasn't what was being referred to at all, but I think it's a very relevant thing to think about either way.

                            I've been having arguments with my partner lately. <br/><br/>She uses a chef's knife for slicing bread. When I ask her why she isn't using a serrated bread knife, her response is that "it doesn't really matter and this is the way I've always done it." My point of view is that it makes more sense to use a tool for it's intended purpose, rather than using a tool with a different purpose to achieve the same goal—even if you can make it work all right.<br/><br/>To me, traditional games have an clear player goal in mind, albeit implicit. But since it's not stated, many players have used the system in other ways than it's originally meant to be used, or have modified the tool to fit their own purposes. <br/><br/>You <i>can</i> use a chef's knife to slice bread. You could even make a chef's knife serrated. But that doesn't mean that the chef's knife is particularly flexible. It just means that you're creative and/or stubborn.                        </div>

Like I said before, this isn't, in my view, at all like someone showing up to a soccer game and asking to use their hands. If someone showed up to a session of D&amp;D and insisted on making a GURPS character, that would be an issue. But what I'm talking about is simply player goals, not system. If I am interested in running standard dungeon crawls or something, and a player wants more RP or story, I am happy to try to provide a game that gives that player something fun for them to do. As I said, I have my views on what I prefer, but I think people get way too ideological about these things and ultimately all that matters is whether people at the table are enjoying themselves and want to come back for another session. <br/><br/>I'm not saying people are imagining the game they want. I have a 'perfect session' in my head as well. And I do think there are breaking points in a group (places where people clearly want different things and a decision needs to be made about whether they should continue to game together or try to compromise). My only point is you can, and people frequently do, take that ideal too far. There is a lot to be said for lightening up and deciding to have fun, even if what is being offered isn't the thing you normally strive for. I tend to prefer sandbox style, traditional campaigns. But if one of my friends wants to run something like Dungeon World, Fate, Gumshoe, Hillfolk, or something even more far afield from my usual tastes, I'll happily participate and not wreck it for people. It is still a game and can still be fun. And because my friends are not jerks when we game, I can be fairly certain they are going to mix in things they think I'll enjoy. <br/><br/><br/> </div>

I think we are running the risk of getting lost in analogies here, but all that matters is how good the sandwich tastes. However, I'd add, when it comes to RPGs and such, I think what constitutes a 'good tool' is a lot more subjective than cooking or something. That is part of why these conversations tend to go off the rails. Instead of people just being honest and saying "I like this better", it tends to be expressed more like "this is good design" or "this is real roleplaying and this isn't" (or "these traditional games are 'toys'---by implication other games are more serious). <br/> </div>

You may have whiffed the intent here, which, I suspect, was a comment on the people who think that there is "one way to roleplay" -- not out of some sort of one-true-way-ism, because they don't even really examine it enough to grasp that there ARE other ways.  This is extremely common in people who've got a lot of roleplaying years under their belt, but have done almost all of it with the same group and generally in very trad systems.  Usually they think everything drops down to a sort of task resolution system where the GM wallpapers over any issues, and generally there's more to it, but the rest varies more depending on the playstyle of whatever the original group was.  <br/>.</div></blockquote>
Sure, I may have missed his point (which is why I said I wasn't 100% sure what he meant (if he wants to weigh in on whether I did miss it or not, that would be great, because I was genuinely unsure of his meaning). All I was talking about here was how people theorizing about what constitutes roleplaying in online communities, almost never matches the reality of what I see with people playing at the table. I think with theory in general, whatever theory it happens to be (traditional ideas or ideas related to things like the forge), I think they often have a very negative effect on live table. I've experienced this first hand when I've fallen in love with a concept or argument and taken it too much to heart. But over time you notice if something just doesn't work in play. A lot of stuff sounds good on paper, sounds good in the context of an online argument (often because people can be very skilled at making arguments but still be wrong about things), and doesn't land at the table at all. I didn't have a specific mindset or theory in mind though. I was speaking very broadly here. When people get overly rigid about 'what is roleplaying', to me that is often a red flag. This is a hobby where people have developed different sensibilities around 'what is and why' independently and there is usually going to be some difference among people in any group. One way to solve that, is to balkanize, form four different groups out of those four different approaches. I prefer to take a more balanced approach and be flexible. I am not there to defend an abstract idea of play in my head. I am there to game and have fun. <br/><br/>I am not saying, don't try to make a game that does X. I am just saying, if 4 people show up at your table and they don't want to do X, you might want to shift gears. If the group is quite mixed, you probably need to find some kind of middle ground. This is where a rulings over rules approach can be very handy. <br/><br/> </div>

I haven't, myself, but I'm not shocked that it's out there.  I've definitely seen people come to the table with very narrow goals or very specific demands -- but it's almost always been from prior play, not from reading stuff.  Usually it's either been "I played in an awesome game before and I want this one to be exactly like it" or "I played in a horrible game where I got to do one fun thing so now I seek that specific thing and tune out the rest".</div></blockquote>
I've been gaming since the mid-80s, so I've seem plenty of functional and dysfunctional groups. At this point in my life, 'functional' is a lot more important than something like what style or approach we happen to be taking. Where I've seen this problem is both at the table and online. And discovered the problem through conversation. I've also experienced it directly myself, when I've held too tightly to a concept or idea about gaming. It is very easy to be swayed by an argument about what a good game should be, then not see you are disrupting your own game by chasing it and not paying attention to what is going on at the table itself. This is just something I've learned from a lifetime of gaming. By focusing on the practical "what is working at this table with these people" I've had way more enjoyment and success. <br/><br/>I've encountered what you describe as well. Again, people can set whatever bar they want. I have met people with an unrealistically high bar, who clearly get in the way of their own enjoyment of the game. Like I said before, this is just a game. And having fun is largely a choice you make when you sit down. If you'r focused on the fact that the GM isn't as astounding as some guy or girl you played with 10 years ago, and that gets in the way of you having a good time, much of that is on you. By the same token if the GM is pining for players they had 10 years ago, that is a bit of a disservice to the players present ready to game now. Which isn't to say, the GM should be terrible, or players should be awful. Just that mindset has a lot to do with the experience you end up having. I.E. I often appreciate really well thought out cultural details in games. However, one of the greatest GMs I ever played with could have cared less about that stuff. If I focused on this, and if I nitpicked rather than letting go, I'd never have enjoyed myself. But I consciously chose not to care about these details, and it turned out it was one of the best campaigns I played in. I've often seen people say stuff like this is a deal breaker for them online, and I find myself wondering if they are missing out. <br/><br/> <br/> </div>

I think we are moving pretty far from the original point I was responding to though. The OP said something about Traditional Games not having clearly stated player goals. My response was this is both a feature and of the big things that make traditional games broadly successful. I am not saying there are not other approaches. <br/><br/>In terms of what you are saying here, I think with RPGs, you can change something as minor as how you get XP and still be playing the game you are playing. And if we are talking about  a game like D&amp;D, that has many editions and options over many years, there are all kinds of things you can do to it and still be playing D&amp;D. Again, this is something you see a lot in the OSR, where people routinely cobble together what they want from different editions, optional rules and home brew hacks (they'll even frequently throw in stuff from other games). At the end of the day though, it is still usually D&amp;D, or at the very leasts, still a traditional RPG of some kind. <br/><br/>But yes, you take out all the dice, replace the pencils with water guns, remove the dungeons and dragons, but leave in the beholders or something, sure you're probably not playing D&amp;D anymore. I think though, what defines D&amp;D is quite wide. I used to run Ravenloft a lot during 2E, and ran multiple campaigns with almost no dungeons, and a heavy focus on RP heavy investigative monster hunts. It didn't look anything like a typical D&amp;D setting or campaign, but was still clearly D&amp;D in our minds. I've played in D&amp;D campaigns that were almost all city intrigue, with very little actual combat, yet it still was D&amp;D at the end of the day. This is the flexibility of traditional games I am pointing to. It is pretty painless to run a game that veers away from what people might think of as the core conceit.                         </div>

Yeah, I might have been pulling the discussion somewhat off topic. Apologies.<br/><br/>I think you make a very fair point. The thing we might disagree on is that where you see a feature — in not having clearly stated player goals — I see a bug. I still believe that most (all?) traditional games have a quite clear player goal, even though it's not explicitly stated. To me, it's more honest to say "This is a game where you should focus on X", as compared to saying "This is a game where you can do anything (but there are only rules for doing X)".<br/><br/>Again, I'd like to point out that I'm not questioning your way of playing or the fun you're having. I'm just interested in hearing a different perspective on things. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>

The only place I've seen the Toys V. Games distinction is here. I am sure it comes from somewhere, but we've had the discussion before about the issue with that model. I don't think we need to get deep into it here. But the reason saying traditional games are 'toys' isn't productive is two-fold and obvious: they are not toys (they are obviously games), adults don't want to play with toys. It is pretty clearly a form of analysis that places traditional games below other types of games, to make them less desirable. But like I said, we've had that discussion here before. If your description in your analysis of the kinds of games you don't play or don't like to play, is pejorative, it isn't a good faith effort to understand.                         </div>

I was definitely not trying to imply that traditional RPGs are less serious then Forgite RPGs. If that was your impression I'm very sorry. What I meant is that game design usually distinguishes toys from games.<br/><br/>Traditional RPGs by game standards are not considered full games but rather game-engines or toys. Is the term 'game-engine' more neutral to you? Because we can stick to it, but to me 'toy' tells more then 'engine': these RPGs are more multifunctional than 'complete' RPGs. They have implicit player goals and win conditions like toys!<br/></div></blockquote>
Maybe a useful word here is 'toolkit'? Just brainstorming. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Maybe I'm reading it wrong, but I like 'toy' because of the open ended nature of play it implies.                         </div>

The thing we might disagree on is that where you see a feature — in not having clearly stated player goals — I see a bug. I still believe that most (all?) traditional games have a quite clear player goal, even though it's not explicitly stated. To me, it's more honest to say "This is a game where you should focus on X", as compared to saying "This is a game where you can do anything (but there are only rules for doing X)".<br/><br/><br/></p></div></blockquote>
My point isn't that you should see it as a feature. But that if you don't understand that people who like traditional games see it as one, you won't understand why people play them. <br/><br/>We'll just have to agree to disagree on implicit player goals in traditional RPGs. Just because there isn't a rule for RP, doesn't mean RP isn't part of the game, for example. To go back to Ravenloft, the only time I had trouble running the RP Investigative focused style was when we switched to 3E. I played that system for years, but I always noticed my Ravenloft games never quite felt the same. I figured we had just changed and it wasn't the game. Then I switched back to 2e for a bit and the feeling we had before was back. I realized the issue was the introduction of things like Bluff and Diplomacy. In 2E there is an etiquette NWP, but that is a knowledge skill, it doesn't replace RP. Obviously people use bluff and still role-play. But my experience was, these things were frequently being used like action buttons and when I took them out, things went back to how we played before. By the same token, having a skill like Perception, can lead to players interacting less directly with the environment you describe. So I do take your point about mechanics mattering, but I also think it is a mistake to assume just because there isn't a rule for a thing, that the game isn't about that thing. If you look at D&amp;D it appears to be a game all about combat, but that is just because you need combat rules. You don't necessarily need RP rules to have great RP (and in fact RP rules can get in the way of good RP*).It is also fairly easy and painless to do something like remove Bluff from a game (or to approach it in a way that is less intrusive). <br/><br/>*Not knocking these kinds of skills in games--I use them myself, but I can see the problems they sometimes introduce to play.                         </div>

I used to play mainstream traditional games that way too and had loads of fun doing it. But to me, there always seemed to be a conflict between our playing style and the actual ruleset. Either the rules got in the way of RP, or RP got in the way of the game.<br/><br/>And when I started playing in other groups, I noticed that others might not place any focus on RP at all — many would just use everything as "action buttons".<br/><br/>I then realized that the systems didn't actually encourage RP. It was just something that we tried to force into the game, because we enjoyed that element. And once I started using systems the way they seemed to be meant to be played, I felt a lot less chafing.<br/><br/>That being said, I think you make a very good point — along with the OP. Games that are lacking in focus might actually encourage players to do their own thing with them. And that might, in a way, make them more flexible.<br/><br/>As you were saying, I think it might just be a matter of definition. To me, if it's not part of the rules, it's not really part of the game — it's added by the players. And I completely respect that you might have a different way of seeing it. Now I see your take a lot more clearly, so thanks for sharing!<br/><br/> </div>

                            Many interesting points in this thread. <br/>I read in OP a confirmation that at the root of the enchantment of Roleplaying games is the infinite power of pretend play. To me the whole "exploration, RP &amp; intrigue in D&amp;D" really is pretend play with D&amp;D clothes. <br/><br/>Why insist on calling it D&amp;D then ? Sometimes big RPG rulebooks are just a pretext for players to distinguish themselves from kids. "We're not playing pretend, we're <span style="text-decoration: underline;">role</span> playing". <br/><br/>So, there's no playing it wrong, only playing something else. Not arguing about the point at which grain of sands make a heap, I agree with ceruleanfive : sparkling water and cucumber don't make a sandwich (try with mint and lemon).                        </div>

Yes, this is the aspect of the word 'toy' which was illuminating for me! This is the way I've read the word too. Toolkit is not bad either!<br/><br/>Since geek culture became mainstream, I think games and toys are not as pejorative in popular culture as they were before. I mean a lot of people treat them as childish things anyway but hey, I dont think that their opinion is important for us <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And a lot of people talk about playing D&amp;D as if they are considering it to be not an unique RPG or specific ruleset, but a whole activity. To me this sounds like they love playing <i>with </i>D&amp;D (the toy) and not playing <i>it</i> (a game). Maybe this is why they are more popular than niche games. Of course it's just a word trying to illustrate a relationship. <br/><br/>If someone is not familiar with the toy / game distinction than (s)he can check out the book 'Rules of Play' or the Gamification course on Coursera (2nd lesson I think). I had thought that this is a somewhat wide-spread notion here but I've already realized it's not.<br/><br/>Also a few important academic quotations regarding this topic:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jesper Juul: The Game, The Player, The World. Looking For a Heart of Gameness.

Also I want to clarify something
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ceruleanfive" rel="nofollow">ceruleanfive</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> I still believe that most (all?) traditional games have a quite clear player goal, even though it's not explicitly stated.</p></div></blockquote>
I agree. I think that every RPG has implicit player goals and win conditions, but they are not easy to identify and the mainstream culture treat these RPGs as they are more versatile then they really are.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" rel="nofollow">Bedrockbrendan</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But the reason saying traditional games are 'toys' isn't productive is two-fold and obvious: they are not toys (they are obviously games), adults don't want to play with toys. It is pretty clearly a form of analysis that places traditional games below other types of games, to make them less desirable. But like I said, we've had that discussion here before. If your description in your analysis of the kinds of games you don't play or don't like to play, is pejorative, it isn't a good faith effort to understand.</p></div></blockquote>
I find it very hard to have a meaninful conversation with you. Your arguments are good but I feel that you are still offended even after I tried to clarify that my intention's are in good faith. Why?<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I'm not native in English, I don't know. I love D&amp;D and I think that trad RPGs are good. I'm just using the academic literatue and try to figure out why and how people differentiate between trad RPGs and Forgites.

I am not distrustful of you, nor am I offended. I reject the label toy, but I don't take moral umbrage at it. I've just been around long enough to see how this kind of control of the terminology gets used to advance play styles in the name of analysis. And in the end, I think that really doesn't help anyone. 'Toy' is a label I've seen applied here to traditional RPGs, and I think the connotations of that word are strong enough that it just isn't a useful descriptor (it certainly doesn't resemble what most traditional players would describe in my mind). It just has the clear connotation of 'that is just a toy'. There is also a history in online gaming communities of antagonism between styles of play (especially when you are looking at the divide between trad games and story). <br/><br/>I am happy to have a conversation with you, but you got to understand I come here from a very different point of view. I see that as a good thing. There are too many bubbles in online discussion forums these days, and I think it leads to unexamined ideas that get reinforced over time. These days, when I do post, it is usually in places where I feel the least amount of comfort or consensus around my opinions. So if you feel frustrated about the conversation, realize there is frustration with it on my end as well. <br/><br/>But I am not trying to be a jerk to you Hamnacb. If that is how I am coming across, that isn't my intention. I am mainly just trying to add another viewpoint to things. <br/> </div>

Personally, I don't think we need to build up a new vocabulary (in fact I think building up these vocabularies is one of the things that hinders communication between play styles and sub-communities in the hobby). Every once in a while, sure you need a clear term for a powerful concept, but there are not hundreds of powerful concepts in gaming. So my approach would be to simply describe things rather than reduce them to a label like toy. And if you are going to use a label, go with one that is clear and obvious like Traditional games or traditional RPGs. I think if your understanding of traditional games, hinges on a metaphor like 'toy', you are probably not going to understand what is really going on when people play them. <br/><br/>Look at it this way, you are trying to understand how traditional games operate. So why begin by coming up with a label like that and defining it. I don't even see the value in it. "Toy" hasn't added anything to the conversation that I can see. This always seems to be how these things go ("hey guys, I have an idea, games that do X are really like Y" and a new piece of jargon is created that someone gets to tie their name to). That is all speculative in nature. Why not take an actual survey of traditional games and people who play them?  Why not dive in and play among them with sincerity.  <br/><br/>Part of the core problem is people are routinely mischaracterizing how people in other groups play games (and this a problem all around, not just a problem here). You can't understand how people play games, why they play, and what they are trying to do when they play them, by speculating from afar. The only way is to try playing games with people on their own terms, without bringing in preconceived notions. If you start with ideas about what people are doing wrong, some think piece or post you want to write when you are done, or some other notion, you'll find all the things you are looking for and likely still not understand what is going on. <br/><br/>By the same token, if you are focused on player goals in your analysis, that is all you are going to be seeing in everything. But 'player goals' isn't something I see many people who play traditional games talk about. It is either just something that is understood and never needs dealing with, or it is a small part of the puzzle. If you read the 1E DMG and think it resonates with people because it has clearly defined player goals, to me that is completely missing the point. I know what aspects of the 1E DMG struck a chord with me when I went back to it in the early 2000s. It is very subjective, but the stuff that hit me had nothing to do with player goals. It had more to do with realizing at some point, the baby had been thrown out with the bathwater, and a  lot of stuff that got derided by people in the hobby during the 90s and early 2000s was actually quite useful. Also, the realization that danger and the unexpected can add tremendously to the excitement of play (rather than say perfectly balanced encounters or perfectly dramatic scenarios). But I wasn't thinking that the key was making everything the players do point in the direction of dungeon crawls or exploration. If anything, I realized campaigns need to balance more. There should be room for that stuff, but room for other things as well. And if you look at the 1E DMG, one of the striking things about it, is how all over the place so many of the tools are. You get the sense that part of the point of the game. Being allowed to go in all kinds of directions. Happy to share my thoughts with you by PM if you'll find that information helpful. <br/> </div>

This is exactly how I feel, and very much in some big ways sums up my experience. My group and I spent a long time trying to play traditional games, to tell our cool and creative stories in the chassis of trad games because we thought that was our only choice. But we weren't really using the system much at all. Most of our sessions had no usage of the mechanics and just had us sitting there freeform roleplaying with the idea that if we needed to, we'd interact with the mechanics, pick up our character sheets, roll some dice, etc. <br/>Which like, isn't by any definition playing the game. It's freeform roleplay while the game sits there and is allegedly involved. But at the time we thought that was how playing the game worked for RP styles like ours (very acting-based, character arc focused stuff where we don't do "play to find out" because we pre-determined the plot beforehand, where the primary focus is long scenes of the characters talking to each other). <br/>We thought this was what engagement with the game meant. <br/>Then as we got into Chuubo's, we really started to realize that the game we had been playing hadn't been useful tools, and the mechanics had been at best just getting out of our way instead of actually facilitating our roleplay and storytelling and being used in play, like the rules in Chuubo's do. And that was just this huge eye-opener for us that led directly to us dropping trad games permanently, because they hadn't been at all doing what we wanted out of games, and games existed out there that actually did things that are useful to us.                        </div>

I've found lots of value in referring to RPGs as toys, and I assume that other people here do so because they also think it's valuable.

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> &amp; <a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">@yukamichi</a> , thank you for trying to communicate what I meant by RPGs as toys. (And I loved the OSR, I don't know why people think I don't know or enjoy any trad RPGs)<br/><br/>Actually, I think that 'toolset' better describes Forgite RPG culture where people tend to treat the RAW more seriously than in trad culture. I had thought that MLwM is only good for the one thing that it try to achieve (like a tool in a platonic way), but the commenters made me realize that every RPG/every 'tool', even MLwM could be used in other alternative ways (maybe less effectively, but sometimes in a thought-provoking way!)<br/><br/>So maybe the dichotomy is better articulated as 'seeing RPGs as toys vs tools' and not 'toys vs games'. Hence now it's not about 'your RPG is not a real game!' but about 'D&amp;D is usually treated as a toy, and MLwM is treated as a tool by the majority (and you can definitely do it in the other way, it's just perception')                        </div>

This comparison is not easy to make, note. D&amp;D has seen dozens of editions with different rules and goals of play, and decades of people trying to do all kinds of different things with the rules. (For instance, the hypothetical "generic task resolution RPG" can't even easily be derived from early editions of D&amp;D; those ideas and those tools were developed later, by trial and error.)<br/><br/>I think that it's entirely conceivable that hundreds or thousands of gaming groups, given <i>decades</i> to fool around with <i>My Life with Master</i>, might come up with a "toolkit" or "toy" which encompasses a huge range of playstyles and approaches to gaming.<br/><br/>Just imagine that for a second: doing all of your gaming, for a decade or more, using just the <i>My Life with Master</i> rules. How long would it take you to come up with a way to adapt those bonus dice and those rolls to a variety of different playstyles? After having done all that, now imagine how <i>flexible</i> the game appears to you: "Hey, I can sit down with this and do anything!" <br/><br/>Sure, because <i>you already have</i>.<br/><br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, spot on! Comparing MLwM with Savage Worlds (both published in 2003) would be more balanced I think.<br/><br/>Going back to my original question, a lot of people tried to find ways to reconcilate expectations. Thus the desire for clear and explicit player goals / win conditions was born. Maybe this intention influenced people to look at RPGs more as tools ('it's good for X') than as toys.<br/><br/>Also, it's negative consequence is when you look at an RPG as a tool, and someone is using it differently than you, there's a bigger chance that you will think 'they use this RPG (tool!) wrong' than if you treat it like a toy ('sure, that's okay too, I just dont like that').<br/><br/>The moral of this topic for me is that originally I had thought that the dichotomy is about games but you made me realize that it's more about culture than the RAW.<br/><br/>What do you think?                        </div>

There was a very lengthy discussion on the topic (maybe 1-2 years ago or more). Again, I am not going to rehash it. But I do think it was used to dismiss traditional games and I also think it is inherently going to create problems in communication about games. Just look at it from the point of view from an outsider here. There has traditionally been antagonism between people who are into story games and people who are into traditional games. On a forum dedicated to Story games, the chosen metaphor for traditional games is toys (because they are apparently about 'play'). And in the course of this conversation, the much more serious metaphor of toolkit has been applied to the SG and Forge approach (which is odd because toolkit is how Traditional and OSR gamers often describe their rulesets). I'll take my comments off the air at this point, but what I am trying to explain to folks is if the aim here is to understand traditional games, and you are coming up with 'traditional games are like toys', I really think you are missing mark. That just isn't how I've come to understand traditional games after decades of play and conversation about them. And I think my point of view is probably going to be something close to the norm among traditional gamers. Similar things happen on traditional RP forums when they talk about story games.                         </div>

                            Yes. I think culture is a huge part of it, but so also is presentation, marketing, and expectations (based on experiences, sure, but also commercial products like adventures, magazines, online play, and even streaming shows).<br/><br/>It would be hyperbole to say that design doesn't play *some* role in this, but I think it's much smaller than people make it out to be. Sure, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, instead of saying "do anything!", tells you how to make a Town and to take the Dogs through it, bearing down justice. But early editions of D&amp;D explain how to draw and stock a dungeon and create a 1st-level bunch of adventurers who go there to collect treasure and escape alive.<br/><br/>Getting a roleplaying-heavy "political intrigue and romance" game out of the original D&amp;D booklets isn't any less of a stretch, I think, than people using <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14505/angry-birds-polaris-hack" rel="nofollow"><i>Polaris</i> to play "Angry Birds"</a> </div>

I don't doubt people have read and played them. What I am reaction to, is descriptions of the rules and of play experience that just don't match what I encounter on a regular basis. I do think people are interpreting traditional games through the lens of the Story Games forum. What I am trying to do is explain there is a whole other way of looking at these things that doesn't hinge on creating new terminology every step of the way. And creating new terms seems to be almost like a reflex here. My problem with 'toy' is two-fold: 1) I think it is a very inaccurate description of what is going on in traditional games and 2) I think it is unnecessary to create new terms all the time, and particularly in this instance, when the description of the thing itself is being hotly disputed. I think the problem here is SG has a very strong paradigm of thought about RPGS that seems rooted in Forge thought. And a lot of that thought doesn't work well when you apply it to traditional games because so much of the forge was a reaction to traditional play and the kind of play that evolved in the 90s. So what I am trying to say is, I think if you guys want to have a fruitful conversation about traditional games, you'll need to step out of that paradigm a little. At least from my point of view that seems like a needed step, because so many of our core assumptions are at odds when we try to communicate about this stuff. <br/> </div>

I am certainly not unbiased when it comes to 4E, and my dislike of the game is pretty deep. I honestly don't even remember what I said about 4E at the start of the discussion, if you remind me, I'll happily respond as honestly as possible. I will say, I do think I didn't give it a fair shake as a player, and I was probably inhibiting my own fun by not engaging it on its own terms. On the other hand, I was far from the only one who felt this way. And I think it is pretty hard to deny it was at least a divisive edition of D&amp;D.

                            I would definitely argue that it has a narrower focus than most editions. DnD 4e very much makes a declarative statement about what DnD is (a tactical combat minis game, in the context of 4e) and then designs specifically and solely for that, whereas most other editions starting with 3e go around and around about what DnD even is, and go for trying to do a lot of different things at once instead of just doing one thing and doing it really well.                        </div>

It has been a long time since I played it, so I am very open to being wrong on this one. But my memory of trying to play 4E was there was enormous focus on the encounter, and it always felt like everything was leading into that (and into a style of play that emphasized tactics). Obviously that can be overcome in any system by a suitable GM. Like I mentioned my friend Bill did that and he had a blast with 4E. So to me, it seemed like a more narrowly focused version of D&amp;D. I also personally found it hardest to deviate from the core rules on. Maybe that was because they were new and I didn't grasp how to do it. But I felt very tethered to what the designers seemed to want. <br/><br/>I guess what I found frustrating with 4E when it came out, was it felt like it doubled down on some of the tactical encounter focus in 3E and simultaneously broke away from the core D&amp;D structure in a way that just made it feel too far outside D&amp;D for my tastes. <br/><br/>With any other game, this wouldn't be a problem at all. I just would not play it, or only play it when that particular style was something I wanted. The issue with that kind of development happening to D&amp;D is, it was 'the game'. That is what most people played. So it was like a bomb went off when it came out (among the people I was gaming with it was something like 5 to 1 against the new edition--and these were folks who adopted each new edition that came out up to that point).                         </div>

And I think if it wasn't D&amp;D, this wouldn't have been a problem for them, as there is a market for tightly focused games that do one thing well. The issue is, D&amp;D is the mainstream RPG played by the largest number of people. So if you have a D&amp;D campaign, chances are you have some people in the group who want a tactical combat mini-game, but also have a mix of people who want other things (or actively despise the tactical miniature aspect of play). D&amp;D has always in part, been about finding the right approach for a given group or GM. Especially by the time of 3E, when a wide variety of play styles and approaches were being used. I don't play 5E, so I cannot comment very concretely on it. But from what I've read of the rules, and what I've heard from people I know who do play it regularly, it seems more in a middle ground, where people with different tastes can meet. Looking forward to playing it and seeing for myself if this is the case, I've just been busy with other things and haven't had an opportunity yet. <br/> </div>

Hi EmmatheExcrucian, tactical combat definitely got a lot of attention in 4E but the idea that it was designed exclusively around that, again, does not gel with my experience of the game at all. And I ran and played 4E for years.<br/><br/>As a perfectly good example of what I'm talking about, 4E is the only edition of D&amp;D with a working conflict resolution system (skill challenges) alongside its typical task resolution system. It is also the only version of D&amp;D where you can potentially earn 100% of your character's xp (although its probably unlikely at most tables) without once making an attack roll because of how hazards, skill challenges, and quests interface with the xp rules --- quests for that matter are their own kettle of fish, given both the PHB and DMG encourage players to create their own quests so will pretty closely resemble Keys depending on how the table handles that. The DMG2 actually has an entire chapter on collaborative storytelling written by Robin Laws that expounds on a lot of this stuff (including rules for roleplaying vignettes and creating Hx-like relationships between the PCs during character creation).<br/><br/>For my own games, I found about half of my "encounters" (which in 4E are not synonymous with "combat") were skill challenges. I only engaged with the tactical combat rules for big setpiece showdowns and very little else.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>

Hi Bedrockbrendan, I absolutely agree that 4E changed the focus of D&amp;D but, and here's the crucial point, "different" is not synonymous with "more narrow" or "less flexible". It just means different. Especially since some of the stuff people have talked about on this thread --- investigations, political intrigue, etc --- 4E actually has tech for supporting moreso than other versions of D&amp;D via its conflict resolution and xp rules.<br/><br/>What 4E did change was the emphasis away from attrition-based strategic wargame play (what usually gets called "the adventuring day or week") to fictionally-charged conflict scenes (what usually gets called "encounters" with the caveat this may or may not involve combat). A lot of people tried to use 4E to do the former, with predictable results: its combat engine isn't really intended for random encounters or "4 orcs in a room" battles. <br/><br/>I actually quite agree with your last paragraph. Ron Edwards recently compared D&amp;D to a folk religion and I think that's pretty spot on. 4E was committing blasphemy to a lot of folks and they responded in kind. Had it been released under any other intellectual property, I have no doubt it would have been overwhelmingly positively received.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>

Hi Emma, yes unfortunately the 4E designers for whatever reasons "hid" a lot of this stuff in the DMGs (along with 4E's "rulings not rules" engine via Rule 42) away from the players. The DMG2 is actually were a lot of this stuff shines through most clearly.<br/><br/>Its pretty obvious 4E's design team was conversant with Forge ideas when they were writing the game. This does not seem to be the case with 5E's design team.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>

It just means different. Especially since some of the stuff people have talked about on this thread --- investigations, political intrigue, etc --- 4E actually has tech for supporting moreso than other versions of D&amp;D via its conflict resolution and xp rules.<br/><br/>What 4E did change was the emphasis away from attrition-based strategic wargame play (what usually gets called "the adventuring day or week") to fictionally-charged conflict scenes (what usually gets called "encounters" with the caveat this may or may not involve combat). A lot of people tried to use 4E to do the former, with predictable results: its combat engine isn't really intended for random encounters or "4 orcs in a room" battles. <br/><br/>I actually quite agree with your last paragraph. Ron Edwards recently compared D&amp;D to a folk religion and I think that's pretty spot on. 4E was committing blasphemy to a lot of folks and they responded in kind. Had it been released under any other intellectual property, I have no doubt it would have been overwhelmingly positively received.<br/><br/>~ Trent</p></div></blockquote>
I would agree different isn't equal to more narrow. However I was stuffing in two complaints into one post. What I found narrow about it was the overall "gaminess". The skill tests felt especially gamey.  There was definitely a large emphasis on the tactical combat of the grid, as well as an extreme focus on balance, and the skill challenge thing, to me, felt very gamey. It was narrowly focused on the interest of a smaller group of players. But so did the whole powers structure thing. I know there were lots of people who that struck a chord with. For me, it felt like a version of the game tailored to a quarter of the overall D&amp;D player base. I would still describe it as pretty narrow. <br/><br/>I've heard the '4E as narrative engine' and I am sure people have found a way to make that work. I can say though, when it first came out, I saw no sign that it was such a thing from reading the PHB or DMG, or playing it (our groups tried to play it many times before it became too contentious). The arguments I've seen from proponents of this on En World, have been pretty obtuse to my eyes (I am sure they get this experience from it, but I don't think I could replicate it if I tried). Still, if it was about 'fictionally charged conflict scenes' that is also pretty narrow in interest. Certainly wasn't what I wanted from D&amp;D. <br/><br/>I still maintain that it would make a really cool wuxia engine or work for similar goals. However I think the comparison to folk religion by Edwards recently was pretty off the mark. They put out a game that a large portion of their customers didn't like. That isn't folk religion, that is not understanding your audience. People were not outraged because their god had been violated, they were angry because it wasn't what they looked for in D&amp;D. Dungeons and Dragons has a particular feel, and particular conceits. These things keep people coming back to it. If you change the overall feel, people who come to it for those reasons, aren't going to play. At the time that 4E game out, I was playing all kinds of RPGs, not just D&amp;D. It was the main game everyone agreed on, but it wasn't like we were strictly devoted to it. We cycled GMs, and cycled games. When we played D&amp;D, we were looking for the experience D&amp;D offered that other games didn't. When 4E came out, the issue was it didn't match our play style for pretty much any game, and the things it did well, seemed a whole lot better suited to other genres. Like I said, it made total sense for something like wuxia, where the genre physics match the powers and the healing rates. But the physics of 4E, didn't match our D&amp;D worlds at all (at least how we had been approaching them). That said, I think it is well designed game in a lot of ways. I just think the argument that it was not well received because people were behaving like religious zealots doesn't hold water (and it sounds like an excuse). My view of 4E is it is successful design in some respects, but a complete failure on the part of the designers to understand their customers (and not a failure of marketing or a failure on the part of customers to appreciate its genius).                         </div>

I am trying to help people on the forum communicate with traditional gamers and I am also concerned about the accuracy of the term (assuming they want their ideas to be taken seriously outside forums like this one). I think if you use the term 'toy' to describe traditional play or OSR play, you are 1) missing the point of both and 2) dooming your ability to communicate with typical fans of both. So my concern is both about the ability of the term to communicate anything meaningful and about its accuracy. People keep mentioning there is an understanding here around the term. But again, based on my participation in the last discussion on it, I am not so sure. I think before you go around coining a term, you really need to assess whether the points the term represents are accurate, because I don't think traditional play has been accurately described here (at the very least, there is a strong reductive quality to the description of it). I guess what I am saying is the conception offered of traditional play really needs to be tested beyond the boundaries of this forum, among more traditional gamers. Do that before you settle on new jargon loaded with meaning.                         </div>

                            FWIW, when I say Toy, I mean Toy, not Tool Kit.<br/><br/>As in, I don't see much difference between the way the vast majority of people use say, Boot Hill RPG rules, and the way most kids would use a bag of plastic cowboys and Indians or a box of Old West themed costumes.<br/><br/>ETA:<br/>Personally, I think being afraid to use the word <i>toy</i> for fear of offending someone automatically limits the space we have to design in. By denying that most RPGs are toys in actual use, we severely limit the possibility of making them better toys.<br/><br/>I suspect that most adults have already clued to the fact that RPGs are mostly toys. If there is a fear of being seen playing with a toy*, well, that may well be one of the already exiting limitations on RPGs being adopted by a greater % of the population, so why worry about it?<br/><br/><br/>(* I'm pretty sure there is)                        </div>

                            I really hate the tribal friction between traditional and story game RPG players.  I think like 99% of it is baseless.<br/><br/>Anyone here who wants to do your part in minimizing that friction, check out Brendan's last post above.<br/><br/>Using the term "toy" runs a risk of making trad gamers think "oh those story gamers are talking about <i>me</i>, and in a way that's <i>not</i> very nice."  So when we have an easy alternative term, let's use that.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a> I think we'll have to agree to disagree here.  I mean, I agree with your points on design, just not on the necessity of using the term "toy" instead of "toolkit".  Given an RPG with various subsystems and moving parts, I think the singular "toy" isn't actually the most precise description of what's provided.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a> , I think you're entirely incorrect about the way the term has been used on this website.  For every one poster who's said "toy" to express dissatisfaction with a trad game, there are many, many more who've used "toy" in a positive way or to describe all RPGs equally.<br/><br/>I'm gonna do what I can, and I'll try to remember to say "toolkit" instead of "toy" from now on (as that's usually what I mean anyway).  <br/><br/>On your end, I hope you drop this idea that S-G is full of story gamers who don't like trad games and talk shit about them by calling them toys.  None of that is correct.  I know you don't harbor the same hate for S-G users that RPG Pundit spews, but I do worry that you've soaked up this idea that S-G represents an "other" when it comes to traditional play -- that S-G is full of people who don't understand or like traditional play.  That just isn't true.  Sure, S-G includes <i>some</i> people in that camp, but I am quite confident that they are in the minority, and anyone who has any ill will toward traditional play is in the <i>vast</i> minority.  Most of us love D&amp;D and some '80s-'90s sci-fi games and White Wolf or Shadowrun and have played some combo of them for decades.  The difference in how we talk about these games (vs elsewhere on the 'net) is not a matter of experience or respect, it's just a matter of independent evolution of community jargon.  I appreciate you sharing with us how that jargon sounds elsewhere, and I aim to be considerate of that.  At the same time, I think the only <i>reason</i> it sounds that way to you is because of the conflict-mongers you're more familiar with.  Without this idea that S-G users are the "other", then "toy" becomes merely a potentially useful perspective on how RPGs function, rather than any sort of loaded statement.                        </div>

                            Well put, Dave.<br/><br/>I agree that avoiding "toy" as potentially inflammatory is a good idea, and it's only a very limited metaphor in any case. As I've repeatedly argued, it has more to do with the attitudes and assumptions of the people playing than the games themselves. I often pick up and dismantle "story games", treating them as toys or toolkits myself, for example.<br/><br/>We can choose to use a "toy/game" metaphor at times, but I don't think it accurately describes important things about actual, real games which almost always straddle the divide meaningfully. For instance, most editions of D&amp;D solidly present themselves as "games", while many "story game" materials present themselves as "toys or toolboxes" (e.g. Levi Kornelsen's Schema materials on DriveThru) - but we can, case by case, decide to treat them in all kinds of nuanced ways. Maybe we take the information in the Player's Handbook literally, but pick and choose at will from the DMG, for a stupid and simple example.<br/><br/>For me, it's a mindset the user adopts, not a feature of the game itself (although the text and the design can inform that somewhat, of course). I can play the same game on two separate weeks, and treat it as a toolkit the first time and a game the second time, or vice-versa. Most of the time, though, our approach won't fall neatly into those two camps, but cross over in messy and complex ways ("Hey, let's throw in these Critical Hit tables from Pendragon, but only roll on them when an attack is accompanied by an insult! Cool?").                        </div>

                            Paul, I think the modular/customizable perspective is useful for looking at both play/use (as you write) and design (as K-Bob writes).<br/><br/>Toy box, toy set, and play set are all in the same verbal set as "toy", I'd think, with their childhood connotations.  So I don't see any advantage there.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>

<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>On your end, I hope you drop this idea that S-G is full of story gamers who don't like trad games and talk shit about them by calling them toys.  None of that is correct.  I know you don't harbor the same hate for S-G users that RPG Pundit spews, but I do worry that you've soaked up this idea that S-G represents an "other" when it comes to traditional play -- that S-G is full of people who don't understand or like traditional play.  That just isn't true.  Sure, S-G includes <i>some</i> people in that camp, but I am quite confident that they are in the minority, and anyone who has any ill will toward traditional play is in the <i>vast</i> minority.  Most of us love D&amp;D and some '80s-'90s sci-fi games and White Wolf or Shadowrun and have played some combo of them for decades.  The difference in how we talk about these games (vs elsewhere on the 'net) is not a matter of experience or respect, it's just a matter of independent evolution of community jargon.  I appreciate you sharing with us how that jargon sounds elsewhere, and I aim to be considerate of that.  At the same time, I think the only <i>reason</i> it sounds that way to you is because of the conflict-mongers you're more familiar with.  Without this idea that S-G users are the "other", then "toy" becomes merely a potentially useful perspective on how RPGs function, rather than any sort of loaded statement.</p></div></blockquote>
If you have an issue with Pundit, that is between you and him. My view on this has long been the majority of people into story games and the majority of people into traditional games, are not bad actors. But I do think there has been a history of antagonism between the camps, and even though it may involve a small number, when people encounter such folk, it leaves a strong impression. Part of the reason why I post here, is to get a clear sense of what the community is really about rather than relying on second-hand information. Most of my interactions have been engaging and respectful (though certainly contentious). In fact my more negative experiences with people advocating for SG or the Forge, have actually been away from this forum in other communities. When that happens though, it is extremely infuriating because some of the forge stuff can be hugely dismissive of the kinds of approaches a lot of traditional people like.<br/><br/>But if I am being honest, the original thread on traditional games as toys, is a thread I remember very differently than some of the others here. That is fine. I don't want to beat a dead horse here. We can agree to disagree on that point. Just to be clear here, it isn't simply about the term 'toy'. As a matter of communication between the sides, it seems like it used to suggest there is something less serious, more child-like, about traditional play. It isn't that I am personally offended by the word, I just think it is so counterproductive and leads us further from an understanding of the dynamics at work in traditional games. And I think it resurrects thoughts of 'brain damage'. My main complaint is that I think what the term was trying to encapsulate is a questionable reduction of traditional and old school play. Traditional play isn't just license to play pretend. That is why the GM is such an important role in traditional RPGs. That is why 'rulings over rules' has become so crucial. <br/><br/>And I do understand people here play and read traditional RPGs. In fact, I found it interesting that there was such an interest here when I first started posting. But I do think there is a huge difference in how folks here tend to examine these games and think about them, and how a lot other traditional players tend to. And I guess I feel like one of the things that sometimes gets in the way of a clearer understanding of the difference, is this impulse to create new jargon for every little concept. <br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a> I can't speak for The Internet, or for A Side (which I doubt actually exists in any degree of unity).  I can only speak for myself and for what I've seen on this website as a regular participant.  So, from that angle:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> The purpose of referring to any RPG, trad or otherwise, as a "toy" is to acknowledge and discuss two things:<br/>a) Unlike a board game, not all participation consists of choosing between specified, finite options.<br/>b) The specific play group in question needs to make some decisions about how they're going to use the RPG.<br/><br/>If you have other language besides "toy" or "toolkit" which you feel is more useful for acknowledging and discussing those things, could you please share?<br/><br/><b>2)</b> Ron Edwards said some crazy shit back in the day about some traditional play/games brain-damaging or infantilizing players.  No one I know actually agreed with him, but many people did soak up some of his personal taste in the course of learning his theories.  Since then, some takeaways from the theories have been retained, but no one here has held onto Ron's personal taste or crazy statements.  Sure, S-G welcomes gamers of all sorts, including those who don't like traditional games/play, but there is no correlation in the conversation here between (a) traditional play and (b) child-like or otherwise bad/inferior play.                        </div>

                            I used "Play pretend". I don't know how it sounds to the outside world, but I really like it. <br/><br/>"open ended games" or "infinite games" are old terms that could be used again. "Infinite" is a bit bloated. "Open ended" goes nicely with the idea of player input but is already recycled by video games for "sandbox". The idea of a game "being more open ended" would be the positive for a game "lacking a clear goal". The size of a funnel is, after all, objectivable.                        </div>

Yes, RPGs in general, although I think trad ones tend to get used as toys more often.<br/><br/> That's likely because there are a zillion times more trad RPGs and most are more readily accessible to the public commercially.<br/><br/> </div>

                            So when I look at RPG RAWs as toys/playthings I instantly have a desire to experiment with them, to discover their features and possibilities. This is fun in itself. Also I dont want to stick to them exclusively because they are not in the focus of my activity, their function is to help me to 'project relatively unstructured play' on them.<br/><br/>And when I look at RPG RAWS as tools ('a device or implement [...] used to carry out a <i>particular</i> function') I tend to use them exclusively. It's because I assume (sometimes I'm wrong) that they were made for a specific goal and I want to achieve that goal, every other activity could only derail my efforts.<br/><br/>I can look at an RPG in both ways. And of course they are just platonic viewpoints. IRL I treat every RPG as a tool and as a toy/plaything at the same time, but their ratio could change.<br/><br/>What my intuition tells me is that if I would go for the extremes then I could run every RPG as 100% toys/playthings and 0% tools and it could be fun. But I have a gut feeling that if I would try to do the opposite (100% tool, 0% toy), and would excusively do the RAW and nothing else (no extra roleplay, play pretend etc) then some of the RPGs would broke down. Not that they wouldn't be fun, I mean, it would'nt even work that way. Some RPGs are designed in a way that you need to fill out it's RAW to have meaningful play. So you need some 'toyness' in your attitude if you want to enjoy them.<br/><br/>What do you think?                        </div>

                            It's just my attempt to put an image to "We're all friends here in RPG land!"  Coming from the story gamer angle, attempting to dispel the idea that story gamers dislike other RPGs.<br/><br/>Dunno if it's working or not...<br/><br/>It's a riff off the HSBC ad campaign from a decade or so back, where they'd repeat images with different titles to illustrate how different things have different meaning in different crowds/places/contexts.                        </div>

I can only speak for myself and for what I've seen on this website as a regular participant.  So, from that angle:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> The purpose of referring to any RPG, trad or otherwise, as a "toy" is to acknowledge and discuss two things:<br/>a) Unlike a board game, not all participation consists of choosing between specified, finite options.<br/>b) The specific play group in question needs to make some decisions about how they're going to use the RPG.<br/>.</p></div></blockquote>
I think rather than defining traditional games as Toys, and then defining toys as those 2 points (which seem largely unobjectionable and pretty much something people who play traditional RPGs just sort of understand from the get-go; I'd simply talk about "Traditional Style" or "Old School Style" and mention those two points as possible things to consider for folks who are less familiar with their underlying assumptions. Again though, I am just one point of view here and not sure what reactions you might get if you float points 1-2 among traditional gamers who are not also into SGs. I can say "that looks good to me", but not sure what reaction this will get when it is taken into other forums and other social media platforms of discussion. For me, this stuff is just about getting an accurate understanding of what people want and expect. I think one of the reasons people get suspicious of this stuff whenever they sense the forge in the background somewhere, is a lot of the categories and speculations from the forge, felt like they were projecting things onto styles of play associated now with OSR and traditional RPGs, that were inaccurate. So if you want to avoid that, talking about traditional style of play is probably going to be a lot more productive. Because then there is more opportunity for folks to weigh in on what that means and the conversation is always tethered around the thing we are trying to talk about (rather than getting lost in a metaphor or analogy---where you end up arguing about the 'toy'/'toolbox' rather than what you are trying to address with the 'toy'/'toobox').                         </div>

                            I personally wouldn't call RPGs terribly distinct from say group storytelling. It's just group storytelling with a ruleset to organize how play happens, and to place creative limitations so it's not an endless space of unlimited possibilites, because of the fact that endless space of unlimited possibilities makes it a lot harder for people to get on the same page without a lot of discussion whereas if you say "Hey, let's play Chuubo's" or "Hey, let's play Apocalypse World", or "Hey, let's play Polaris" or "Hey, let's play Annalise" or even "Hey, let's play DnD", it narrows down those possibilities so that then everyone has a strong idea of the sort of creative constraints for this specific story, this specific roleplaying experience. <br/>It gets everyone on the same page about the sort of story they're going to tell much faster than if you say "Hey, let's play freeform. What kind of story do we want to tell in this roleplay?"                        </div>

                            "Toy" is fine with me. It describes a type of play. That play is associated with children because Serious Important Adults think it's for children and stop engaging in it. That doesn't mean it's childlike in any sort of bad way, just like having a childlike sense of wonder is 100% good unless you're trying to signal to others that you're Serious and Important and since children clearly aren't Serious and Important then you can't have any properties which are traditionally associated with children.<br/><br/>But if we must differentiate the two almost identical types of play according to who is engaging in them, then I suppose we must. Can't have anyone believe we're associated with something that :gasp: children are associated with, after all.<br/><br/>Sounds inflammatory, and I don't think peeps are consciously making this argument, but I do honestly think that's what's behind society saying "to say an adult is playing with a toy is demeaning".                        </div>

You'd be narrowed in on what type of story you're telling then.<br/>You just wouldn't have the structural tools that are part of playing ttrpg.                        </div>

                            Sorry, my reaction was mostly to what you posted reminding me of tons of posts about freeform play, where folks seem to assume that freeforming somehow starts with absolutely nothing at all.<br/><br/>Which, I suppose is possible, but I do find it highly unlikely.<br/><br/>In any case though, I do think you're touching on something important.

I don’t have a strong reaction one way or another, the HSBC thing flew over my head. I found myself trying to reconcile the two different image styles and see if a point was being made by them. I have no issue with anime, but I think with a lot of traditional gamers, it has associations that are very ‘not D&amp;D’ (or at least associated with versions of D&amp;D that are not traditional).  You might consider going with something like Record of Lodoss War if you want anime (since that one is very D&amp;D).<br/><br/> </div>

I would have to disagree here. Again I can only give my experience, but the thing that instantly struck me the first time I played an RPG and that lasted with me, was the sense that I can try anything I want in this world. I felt like I was there, and able to try anything. Whereas in a video game or board game, I was limited by whatever the designers had planned before hand. The key element is the game master, who in part has to play the setting/story/etc. <br/><br/>In terms of getting on the same page. That can be important, but it is very easy to negotiate. I call this the 'franchise check' in my groups (as in 'what franchise are we gaming in'). While it usually won't result in rules overhauls, it very much informs how the GM adjudicates what passes muster for a given situation. For example, how easy it is to turn the tide of public opinion against the local baron and rouse people to rebellion. If we are playing in something meant to feel more like a classic 50s swashbuckler franchise, that is going to be very different from something like Agora (where it may take a whole campaign to even get to that point). My experience here is most groups naturally find this point in their games without even having a discussion. I have found it helpful to hash that over before hand though. <br/><br/>The thing to keep in mind about D&amp;D and traditional play, is it is foundational for most players. It is like a base, but you can put a lot of different approaches on top of it. It is played all kinds of different ways. It definitely has some core conceits. But back to my Ravenloft example, you can take it in all kinds of directions. The only times I've been annoyed at D&amp;D is when things were added in that made that kind of flexibility difficult for me. <br/> </div>

Thanks, Johann. Dave and I put that together a few years back, during one of these discussions. <a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a> is correct that I got the idea from HSBC ads, and it seemed like a good way to get the point across.

The whole point, from my perspective, was to contrast "D&amp;D" and "not D&amp;D", so we chose two images; one which clearly had to do with D&amp;D-like things, and another one which represented the "story game" side.

Okay. That never occurred to me as a thought when I saw the image (but again, I think I missed the ad campaign it was a reference to).                         </div>

                            It's bit of a quirky thing, admittedly; I'd fully expect each reader to draw their own conclusions. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>To me, the last two panels illustrate a typically "D&amp;D" mindset, whereas the former two show a typically "story game" mindset (although both are partially parodies, as well).<br/><br/>The juxtaposition puts how minor our differences in opinion might be into perspective (or, at least, that's how I interpret this kind of visual metaphor).                        </div>

                            I just realized how strong are my own attitudes toward gaming (RPG-ing).<br/><br/>I wanted to run a trad campaign again so I was searching for a fairly conventional system of rules. Nothing was good enough.<br/><br/>What I was really trying to do is to relax and play casually without worrying about the 'system', and concentrate on other aspects of gaming. To look at RPGs as a <b>toys</b> again. But I just couldnt do that! Even 13th Age which is very close to the category of 'D&amp;D for me' felt somehow too cruchy and too 'slack' at the same time.<br/><br/>What I ended up with was a lightweight homebrew AW hack with elements from City of Mist, The Watch and The Veil. Everything in it serves the purpose of my agenda. It's definitely DIY and looks lame as a toy but it's also sharply focused. For me, it's a good enough <b>tool</b>.<br/><br/>Nearly at the same time, a nice little flame erupted on the Hungarian interwebs about the topic of 'cheating' with dice to save PCs/story. What I realized that the opposing sides do not understand each other because they have different attitudes toward our hobby. For me it's pretty obvious that a d20 game and crits will often results in PC death and if I would want to run a non lethal campaign I should use different rules (tools) for it.<br/><br/>But for the other side of the debate changing over to another game, learning totally new rules and mindset etc. just doesnt make any sense. They just dont really care about the rules, it's okay for them to cheat here and there for the sake of saving PCs and not ruining long sessions of play. They fall back to the RAW when it's fun and serves their agenda but immediately diverge when they feel it's in their way. They dont need specific tools for their gaming they just use what they have and improvize when they have to.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that we both homebrew a lot <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            i missed this thread when i was off sulking<br/>great point hamnacb. in the op i mean. really good thread<br/>but<br/><br/>i spent a decade trying to get RPGs to tick from trad games (hadn't read D&amp;D, if i had had something like b2 or b4 i'd have been golden i guess). the incoherence was an obstacle for me to get it. i had a couple of crashed fate campaigns, we never got it to sing<br/><br/>when i read fiasco we started having good games right away<br/><br/>then OSR meshed better with me then trad. clearer prep &amp; procedures. the turn order from the old B/X, BECMI etc games was something that i liked, for example (which is something that we don't use anymore, but it was valuable training wheels for me).<br/><br/>and, the lessons from OSR (prep situations, locations and life) can be applied to many trad games too. i can dust off those old WW games or w/e and give them new life.                        </div>

                            I think the word toy is as loaded as the word game.  <br/>I mean, some people refer to guns as toys... which I find... strange.<br/>Most words come loaded, after experiencing life, with preconceptions.  <br/>The word toy usually denotes something for children, and adults can find this as off-putting as telling them that most role-playing games are games without a win condition.<br/>Maybe I'm wrong?<br/>Maybe one day, the strangely fertile mule that is rpgs, will have a better noun to describe itself?                        </div>

                            The reopened spicy roll thread mentioned the term <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=14371" rel="nofollow">bricolage</a> which I was not familiar with.<br/><br/>It totally nails down what I tried to articulate not in the OP, but in later posts: The dichotomy of viewing RPGs as toys or as tools.<br/><br/>Maybe it would be less offensive (but unfortunately more academic and less clear) if I would postulate that we usually see RPGs as the product of bricolage or of engineering, and most of the serious clashes in our hobby culture (Is fudging against the fun or not? Etc) could be traced back to this fundamental dychotomy!<br/><br/>Originally bricolage was the dominant framework but since Forge we have a subculture and jargon for engineering RPGs! Its not the next level, its a totally different thing!<br/><br/>I feel content. I understood something important here!                        </div>
