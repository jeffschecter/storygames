My girlfriend is working though, so I'm all alone at home.<br/><br/>If anyone out there has a manuscript they want to have a critical eye passed over, now is a good time for me.<br/><br/>What I'm offering to do is read your game text and make notes as I go, pointing out what I understood and what I didn't.  I'm quite harsh on text and won't pull any punches with this.  Hopefully that will give you some pointers on where the text needs to be clarified.  Or maybe it won't, because it might be pretty good already.<br/><br/>I'm not really offering to playtest, just to make sure the text makes sense and explains how to play/run the game.  I'm also not really looking at critiquing the GAME so much as the TEXT.  Although I'll comment on the game, it's not really the focus of this.<br/><br/>So, if you think your text is pretty much ready to go to press, ashcan or external playtest even, but you'd like another opinion before you do, that's what I'm offering.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/>The shorter your game is, the more likely I am to have time to do this properly.  If your game is over 10,000 words (including examples) I might not have time do as good a job as if it was 5,000 words.  I probably won't even start on anything over 20,000 words.<br/>I really only want "complete" manuscripts.  By that I mean that your game is written and you think it's ready for other people to read it and run it.  Please don't send me a whole bunch of disjointed notes for a game you want to write, because frankly there's not really much I can do to help if you're at that stage.  If you have to say something like "I know the section on scene framing needs to be re-written", then there's nothing I can do to help with that section or any section which relies on it.<br/>I can only really do this once for any given game.  Once I've read or played your game, I'm too contaminated by knowledge of how it works to really stand back and see how the text works.<br/>I'm not a professional editor or anything, but I'm quite likely to be your target audience.  So if I can or can't understand your game text, chances are I'm a good indicator of the general consumers who'll be buying/reading it when it's widely available.<br/>I'll point out typos and grammatical errors when I spot them, but I'm not really the best person for that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79084/#Comment_79084" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T09:26:45+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  9:26AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ensemble is in a slightly pre-ashcan post-public-playtesting stage.  There are a few rules that aren't in the text yet, but that's because I'm still debating whether or not they should be.
