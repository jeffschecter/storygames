One set is called "skill dice" and one set are called "fiend dice." The player decides how many of each to roll based on their skill rating. The rating equals how many are rolled in total.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, so good (I hope)...<br/>\n<br/>\nI had two different ideas for it. One was add each side up. If the skill dice total was higher, the player would get a number of successes to the fiend dice rolled. Likewise, if the fiend dice total was higher, the player would fail. Under this idea, I had a rule stating at least 25% of the dice had to be fiend dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second idea, suggested by someone else, was to use a very similiar dice mechanic to Risk. Match dice up to see how many of the fiend dice were beaten. Even the person who suggested this referred to it as a "yes" system. They had no set minimum and had a maximum of 50% on fiend dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn both cases, matches on the fiend dice meant that many xp were earned for the skill or attribute it was tied to. In other words, if 2 "6s" came up, then 12 xp were earned. Only the highest match set would be totaled. Additionally, under my original idea, the fiend dice total would have to be beaten.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuccesses would either decrease the time for a task or it would add to the quality of the task. I don't know whether to tweak or just start over with a new method for task resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, any comments, questions, critiques would be appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J.%20Scott%20Timmerman" title="J.

That way, you could rate challenges by the number of successes total to be overcome, and the player would have to decide how far she'd like her character to get that round, with the risk of making no progress with more fiend dice.<br/><br/>(I say "challenge" because "task" sounds like work.)<br/><br/>Whether matching dice up or adding them up, it's about as much work.  However, I think that matching them up can lead to less dramatic success or failure in a roll.  I find that players tend to prefer total success or total failure.<br/><br/>-JT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133505/#Comment_133505" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T16:13:58+00:00" title="March  8, 2008  4:13PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would go with whichever one is easier for the player to do. A simple system of taking the highest, or some other matching system, may be easier than the mental arithmetic required to add up dice, but it wouldn't take much to push it the other way.<br/><br/>However I don't think the first system really works, because the reward for taking more fiend dice (more successes) will often be low. If I can accumulate successes then I will likely always take 1 fiend dice and just keep rolling till I have enough. The 25% minimum on fiend dice is un-appealing, because it shows that the basic mechanic is not working perfectly. A well balanced mechanic probably won't need anything like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J.%20Scott%20Timmerman" title="J.

I'll probably use a d6 variant just to keep things moving forward.  I had pictured stating that just keep rolling one die wouldn't work in opposed tests.  Time would be a huge factor in unopposed tests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133523/#Comment_133523" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T18:15:07+00:00" title="March  8, 2008  6:15PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first thought is that there might be an easier way to do this.<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>Roll any number of dice (you choose).
