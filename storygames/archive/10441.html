A week ago, at Dragon Con, I played in a homebrew system created by Tobes Hubbird ("Ingenuous") that owed a lot to Dogs. And I have myself recently been messing about with a Dogs-esque mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet, to tell you truth, these game systems don't really resemble one another that closely, because they pick up on and emulate different elements of the Dogs system. This provokes the question: <b>What makes the Dogs conflict mechanic awesome?</b> What are its distinctive characteristics, and which of them are really vital to the gameplay, the mood of Vincent Baker's game?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I have:\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n\u2022  dice pool assembled by reference to narrativist traits ("Momma said there'd be days like this.")<br/>\n\u2022  you and your opponent take turns raising and seeing<br/>\n\u2022  each raise and each see corresponds to an act of narration<br/>\n\u2022  mechanic for having arguments, and not just for fighting/combat<br/>\n\u2022  you can see your opponent's dice<br/>\n\u2022  you can drop out of the conflict at any time<br/>\n\u2022  open-ended conflict, until someone is willing to give<br/>\n\u2022  escalation (i.e. new dice by bringing new skills, new approaches to bear</ul>\n<br/>\nIn my own game, I'm substituting cards for dice, a move which means that, while you can see the size of your opponent's hand, you cannot see how good the cards are. I'm interested to find out how significantly this changes the tone of the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232133/#Comment_232133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T19:13:13+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  7:13PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=206" rel="nofollow">this</a> particularly helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232138/#Comment_232138" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T19:45:19+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  7:45PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure what the "V" in the subject line means, but here's mine:<br><br>* The way narration is distributed allows each player to keep total control over his or her character and what is happening to him/her, but still pushes and pulls you in different directions.<br>* That same interaction works really well when players riff off each other's contributions, selling each other's actions and establishing details about the fiction as they do so. It's narrative story-building (within a scene) as well as a contest/conflict.<br>* Pushing forward dice as you narrate is a cool and subtle way to communicate subtext. For instance, narrating a really strong move but pushing forward low dice can be used to communicate that you want to see your character fail in that particular attempt, like someone overstepping their bounds with an overly aggressive attack.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232140/#Comment_232140" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T20:40:41+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  8:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            According to Vincent himself, the fact that you can't use the system without narration is an important thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232143/#Comment_232143" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T20:58:03+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  8:58PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It forces you to roleplay.

That may produce bluffing and over/underestimating the strength of your opponent's hand.  I look at your hand of ten cards, and am afraid, but don't realize that they're all twos and threes.  So I escalate.  Or you look at my hand of four cards, thinking you can easily beat me, but don't realize that they're all face cards, and so you lose without escalating.<br><br/>It would produce a different play than the open revealed dice. The closed information version would fit some but not all other games, whereas the open information one fits other games.<br/><br/>You could, of course, have the cards played face up.  Or some face up and some face down (like some poker variants, or blackjack).                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
