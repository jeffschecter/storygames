                    We have a problem to solve.<br/>
<br/>
Many gamers, especially online ones, are caught up in a debate that doesn't actually exist on all the levels they think it does.  Many of us (yes, I include myself), when looking at theory, get caught up in images of people, and of "what they're really saying underneath".<br/>
<br/>
And then we debate it.  Pointlessly.  Often with varied strains of utterly useless intellectualism and anti-elitism thrown straight into the pot - often, the anti-elitists fire first and hardest, as a defense.  And when others come to tell them that this isn't necessary, the defenders know each other, and speak the same language.<br/>
<br/>
Sooner or later, somebody gets dogpiled.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody waves around a name or two; someone accuses another person of telling them that they're having the wrong kind of fun, or someone accuses another of being anti-intellectual.<br/>
<br/>
This is a thing I want to help stop and, aggravatingly, I fall prey to it myself often enough to piss off people on both sides a bit, now and then.<br/>
<br/>
But I think we need to stop it, and I've been trying.<br/>
<br/>
No names.  Just ideas.  What else can we do?                </div>

                            I have the same answer every time a question like this comes up.<br/>
<br/>
We game and we write about the good time we had or what went wrong and how we'd do it differently next time.<br/>
<br/>
And the people who want to bash the Forge or whatever, fuck 'em.  I have no time for them.<br/>
<br/>
Levi, those were some nice threads and if you've got more in ya, that's great.<br/>
<br/>
But fuck the negative grognards who post more about bashing than they do about playing.  Their ratio is way off and their priorities are fucked.                        </div>

If the First sentence of that read "Many ___________"  rather than "Many Gamers" I could entertain myself for hours by writing in whatever group on the internet popped to mind.<br/>
<br/>
I don't mean to diminish the importance of dealing with these things.  Coming to terms with the thundering fucktards without letting them ruin something you love is never as easy as it sounds, but it's not a problem limited to gaming.<br/>
<br/>
Th advice remains the same, though, and people have already laid it down pretty well.  Worry about what you have to say, not about being right, and worry even less about other people being wrong.  <br/>

Remember, the biggest flamewar you've ever seen still means less than a gnat's fart. :)<br/>

                            Yeah, good advice all.  For me, I can deal with attacks on ideas and stuff, but when it comes to attacks on friends or aquaintences, it gets harder to stomach and easier to turn on the "strafe them with random attacks" switch. But yeah, a few deep breaths and stepping away usually does the trick. Usually.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Your advice remains good.  But just saying "fuck 'em" when they often have something of value to say, however much their anger gets in the way, however much they wave around names or the like, isn't easy.<br/>
<br/>
I want to get past that posture and actually talk to these people; I think that all of them, on both sides, have good and helpful things to say.  But in trying to listen, I also sometimes hear things that skew my own point of view, often unhelpfully.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I just want to try and get everyone arguing to attend and pitch in on  a communications course.<br/>

                            Levi, some people don't want to communicate. They want to WIN. Maybe there's a good idea or two buried in them, but you <i>cannot</i> use it. If you do, they will turn right around and hit you with the "see, you really agree with me" gambit and keep on trying to Win.<br/><br/>You cannot have a civil, intelligent discussion unless <i>everyone</i> in that conversation wants it to be civil, and intelligent, and <b>a discussion</b>. It only takes one dedicated bomb-thrower to stop you. It's even more difficult when the bomb-thrower has learned how to pretend to be interested in dialogue.<br/><br/>I went through what you're doing last summer. I had a lot less good grace and patience about it than you do, and I came into it with some significantly more controversial ideas than you have. I admire what you're trying to do. But it Will Not Work.<br/><br/>What Judd says. Play. Talk about your play. Talk in smaller, narrowcast channels.<br/><br/><i>---The troublemaker occasionally known as Tigerbunny.---</i> </div>

I think we should talk about our play on RPG.net and other places where it can be seen by all kinds of gamers who like all kinds of games.<br/>
<br/>
But engaging some people in an honest conversation is sometimes futile and it is a waste when that arguing time could be spent making something cool up or helping someone out.                        </div>

I appreciate that you've learned these things through hard experience.  But, at least for now, I must disagree.<br/>

I see difficulty and a history of miscommunications and arguments that never had to happen, and which have poisoned how some of us talk to each other  - including some of my own.<br/>

Not futility, though.  I don't see that.<br/>

As someone who has fallen into his share of scuffles, but has steered clear for the most part, I'm afraid you'll be unpleasantly surprised. There is a great deal of wilfull misunderstanding and uncharitable reading.<br/><br/>While some people really are communicating past each other and could come to an equitable understanding, there are a number of usual subjects who are actively trying to shut discussion down. Mark knows.<br/><br/>Judd's advice really is the best. Talk about your actual play and the practical application of your theoretical ideas.<br/><br/>When you're talking theory in the absence of application or evidence, it is too easy to simply dismiss your ideas and get into a tautologous argument. If you're talking about your actual play, they're in a position where they either have to discount your play or actually enter into a productive discussion by explaining what they think is happening.<br/><br/>It has the added benefit that well-adjusted people who are not interested in that style of play can back out without feeling that it's an attack on the way they like to play, while people who are open to new things get an honest-to-goodness example that really expresses what you're talking about. It's win-win. <br/><br/>I believe this is a big part of the reason that Ron and Clinton have chosen to channel all theory discussion through the Actual Play forum at The Forge, by the way.                        </div>

                            Funny. I just posted in my LJ this morning that I won't debate people on the internet anymore.  I will <i>discuss</i> issues if that's what people are after, but as soon as I see debate forming, I'll bow out.  It just takes so much time and energy that I don't have.  And whether that's RPG theory, or philosophy communities, or political discussions, it applies to them all.  So I agree with most of the folks in this thread: try to be civil, but if it shows that the other side has goals other than mutual understanding, just walk away.                        </div>

                            Christian, <br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough I had that exact discussion with Mo last night. She took it slightly farther too, saying that she wasn't doing things to convince anyone of anything. She wants to have discussions with people who like the ideas she's putting out and want to "jam" to make them better ideas. <br/>
<br/>
I think I'm getting to that point myself. I don't have the energy to convince people of things anymore. I'll say my say, and I'll jamm with those who want to syncratize or expand -- but convincing people, even people who aren't trying to be obstructionist, isn't what I'm looking for.                        </div>

                            I dunno. I find it healthy and useful to debate and bicker with people on the internet. It helps me bolster my own views -- or tear them down, where necessary -- by testing them in the fire. My discussions with Rob in my LJ the past few days have been awesome.                        </div>

                            Well, sure, but honestly, that has benefited from the fact that while we _disagree_, no one thinks the other guy is being a dick about it. Perhaps more importantly, there is no sense that no amount of discussion will ever change the views involved (and as a corollary, that no one is arguing solely for the sake of arguing - that there is implicitly a disagreement or misunderstanding, and both parties are equally interested in zeroing in on it).  When real discussion happens, that's the crazy goodness I'm in this for, and as an example, Adam &amp; my tangling in his LJ has been both awesome and thought provoking for me.<br/>
<br/>
No slight to jamming (or Riffing, as we tend to call it) - love that too. Thing is, I tend to find that the people I can riff with and the people I can also have productive disagreements with, so all in all, it seems to have more with the kind of discussion, and more with how people act, at least in my experience.<br/>
