Drakar och Demoner (Swedish for <i>"Dragons and Demons"</i>) was extremely popular in the 80s. A lot of people in Sweden think that Drakar och Demoner is a translation  of Dungeons and Dragons, which it's not. Instead it's based on Basic Role-Playing. New editions have been released steadily, I think there are nine editions now, but I haven't read or played the recent ones.<br/><br/>I didn't play any Dungeons and Dragons growing up, and I still haven't, neither has the players in my group. When I think of nostalgic fantasy adventures, it's for Drakar and Demoner. When I got a copy of Whitehack it was my first introduction to the OSR movement, but when I thought about what old-school adventures meant to me, it was Drakar och Demoner. I'll write some on Whitehack and the old Drakar och Demoner adventures, and I'll be happy to answer questions on either one.<br/><br/>The first adventure we played was <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindelkonungens_pyramid" rel="nofollow">Spindelkonungens pyramid</a>/<i>"The Pyramid of the Spider King"</i> (article in Swedish, but perhaps Google translate can help), originally published in 1982, but I have the re-issue from 1984 that came with the second edition rules. The second adventure was <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skelettbyns_hemlighet" rel="nofollow">Skelettbyns hemlighet</a>/<i>"The Secret of the Skeleton Village"</i> (article in Swedish). You can find <a href="http://www.riotminds.se/downloads/OLD/04a.pdf" rel="nofollow">both adventures</a> at the website of the current copyright owner, Riotminds. It's safe to say that most Swedish roleplayers above a certain age knows these two adventures.<br/><br/>I may write about the above adventures in the future, but now I want to talk about the most recent adventure, called Fritagningen/<i>"The Rescue"</i> (also <a href="http://www.riotminds.se/downloads/OLD/40d.pdf" rel="nofollow">available</a> at Riotminds' website). It was one of two introductory adventures for the fourth edition of Drakar och Demoner.<br/><br/>The first session of The Rescue started with character creation. We have decided that new characters start at the same level as the lowest level of the group, and since the other player had a level 3 character, that was where the new character started. One player had to miss the session, so we only had two players.<br/><br/>The old character was (using the layout from the descriptions of example NPCs on the back cover of Whitehack):\n<blockquote><i>Assim, Level 3 Deft Halfling Treasure Hunter</i><br/>Str 11, Dex 10 (Halfling), Con 7, Int 12 (Storytellers Guild), Wis 8, Cha 15 (Halfling); HP 8, AC 6, ST 12, Move 25, To-hit: +1; Attuned to: Sling, (Rope); Sling, Elven Rope with Grappling Hook, Crossbow, Compass, Studded Leather Tunic; 442 gp, 536 sp, 219 cp, jewels worth 200 sp.</blockquote>\nThe newly created character was:\n<blockquote><i>Wengel, Level 3 Deft Duelist</i><br/>Str 12, Dex 10 (The Whirling Cape), Con 13, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 7 (Engelkreutz); HP 10, AC 6, ST 12, Move 25, To-hit: +1; Attuned to: Father's Rapier, (Boots); Rapier, Rope, Lantern, Mule, Studded Leather Armor; 23 gp.</blockquote>\nThe adventure description starts with a full page that the GM is supposed to read aloud to the players. It tells how the characters reach the small village Zerim, walks into the village center and into the tavern, joins a village council meeting and agrees to help the villagers get rid of some bandits that haunt them. Three times during the monologue the players get to say "yes" if they want to join the meeting and if they accept the mission. We all thought this was quite humorous, and the players didn't mind getting railroaded into the adventure. I'm using Whitehack's prices, but all the rewards and treasures from the Drakar and Demoner adventures, so there are some mismatches. The PCs were promised 20 gp to share, which would amount to six days of dried food for one person and a sleeping bag. Of course they agreed! One of the players said it reminded him of Seven Samurai, which is looking at it positively.<br/><br/>They knew that the pirates had kidnapped a village girl during their last raid, so the next morning they left for the bandit fort in the forest. One player, the only one with previous experience of OSR games, tried to ask NPCs to join them, but they were too afraid. At the time I didn't think about all the precedence for hirelings in OSR games, but even if I would have, it was nice to focus on the PCs. As soon as they reached the forest there was the first random encounter, a baby bear that came up to them. The bear's mother wasn't too happy about meeting the PCs and attacked.<br/><br/>I used the bear from the full spread of monsters included in Whitehack (Bear: HD 5d+10, AC 6, Move 30). I rolled 26 HP on the 5d+10 Hit Dice which, if you paid attention to the PC stats above, was more than theirs combined. The bear also won the initiative and attacked the duelist by biting his stomach. I rolled 1d20+5 (monsters have a to-hit bonus equal to their HD) against 19 minus the duelist's AC (19-6=13). Natural weapons do 1d6 damage and I rolled a 6. The duelist was down to 4 HP.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the halfling had climbed a tree, using the halfling group assigned to dexterity to make a double positive roll (roll 2d20, choose the best one). I had tried to invoke the species group negatively to force a double negative roll (roll 2d20, choose the worst one), but the player referred to Frodo and talked about that time he climbed some tree in the book, so I let the player have it his way. The duelist missed his attack on the bear.<br/><br/>Next round the bear attacked first, still chewing on the duelist's stomach. I rolled another 6 on the d6, but this time the player used his constitution save to lower the damage. He succeeded, and rolled a 3 on his d6. With the damage reduced to 6-3=3 he still had 1 HP. He tried to climb the same tree as the halfling, but failed his roll. The halfling, meanwhile, used this day's special attunement feat to hit the baby bear with his sling, drawing the mother's attention away from the characters. He didn't want to do any damage, had he killed the baby bear they would never get rid of mother bear. I let him succeed without a roll, he's deft with his sling after all, and the plan worked. The two bears left the characters in the tree with no XP for the encounter.<br/><br/>Here we had a fun realization when it came to the first aid rules of Whitehack. They require a trained skill roll, which means that if you don't have a relevant group on your character sheet you make a double negative roll. If you succeed you regain 1d6-3 HP from the last battle, but if you fail you lose 1 HP. This would put the duelist on 0 HP, not death, but since they didn't have access to a deft or wise healer he would get a permanent disadvantage. "Better to let it bleed out," said the duelist. "Yeah, you never know what happens when you start messing around in there. If you push something in from one side, something else will stick out on the other side," said the halfling.<br/><br/>Instead the decided to camp for the day to regain HP (it was still late morning the same day). The kidnapped village girl would have to wait! I like how the first aid rules in Whitehack forces the players to make a decision on how to treat wounds. If they had brought a medic or healer there wouldn't be a problem. I guess that's another OSR wisdom learned.<br/><br/>Next morning the duelist had regained 3 HP, by making his constitution roll in the evening, but failing in the morning. A friendly centaur showed up, another random encounter from the adventure. He showed them the way to the bandits' fort where they spent a couple of hours scouting the grounds. The fort was in a clearing, with 100 meters of open grass between the edge of the forest and the 4 meter high palisade. There were two bandits guarding the outside of the palisade, with one guard outside and one inside the gate. Thanks to a traitor in the village the bandits had been warned. The centaur had told the PCs that he thought there were 10 bandits in the fort.<br/><br/>Here the session ended.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428901/#Comment_428901" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T13:16:42+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  1:16PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There were two things I could have done better:<br/><br/>At the tavern in the beginning of the adventure, according to the text the PCs can detect the traitor if they pass a perception check. This is common in Drakar and Demoner, but I have the impression it's usually not a big part of OSR games. I guess it depends on the OSR game, but in general there's the idea that if the players say their characters pay attention to what's going on the PCs will notice it, otherwise not. I made the players roll wisdom, which the duelist passed and the hafling fumbled. It felt very forced to come up with in what way the PC fumbled, but the player graciously suggested that he wouldn't believe whatever the duelist noticed. The duelist never said anything, so it didn't matter. I have since decided that I'll let the players initiate any perception activities. If the player describe that they search in the right place they will find whatever it is, and if they decide to roll a perception roll I will suggest places they can look. They still have to describe that they do it. It feels like a nice trade off between player skill and character skill, and I'll try it out in future sessions to see how it works.<br/><br/>The other thing was that I just quickly read aloud the description of where the important people in the village lived (hunter, miller, and so on). The halfling-PC player enjoys experiencing the world through his PC, so he felt cheated. I've decided to make more of an effort to describe things from the PCs perspective in the future. I think it makes for a richer game, and it's something I always struggle with. I'm usually not very interested in describing the environment, but I think it improves the game when I do, so I'll try. I do want to avoid the PCs spending all session talking to villagers without getting to where the action is, but I'll have to keep some of the exposition, and not just cut to the next piece of action.<br/><br/>Last Tuesday we played the second session of The Rescue, joined by the missing player's Strong Barbarian. But I'll save the report of their commando strike on the fort for another day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428909/#Comment_428909" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T16:47:13+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  4:47PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!

I usually don't post actual play reports, but I'm so into Whitehack at the moment that I really want to discuss the game.\n<blockquote>Neat!  I'm glad to hear that people are playing Whitehack -- I've been reading it and thinking about what kind of game I want to play with it.  And reading your account reminded me of several little rules; good reinforcement!</blockquote>\nI know what you mean when you say "several little rules". We've played five sessions so far (Spider King: 1, Skeleton Village: 2, The Rescue: 2), and between sessions I've re-read the rule book. Each time I've spotted new little wrinkles to rules I hadn't considered before. It's almost like we started with the core ideas, and have added new things each session. Because of the short length of the rules text each sentence includes something important, and there's almost no redundancy.<br/><br/>Three examples from the above session:<br/><br/>1. Previously we haven't used inactive slots. The players have only noted their active slots on the character sheet, and have left the inactive slots to be decided later. This session I required them to also decide their inactive slots, because they may want to switch their active attunement during the session and I wanted that also to be a tactical choice.<br/><br/>2. The halfling above has the inactive attunement "rope". We discussed if attuned objects had to be a specific object or if they could be a general type of object. We decided on a type of object, thinking for example of Robin Hood being able to pick up any bow and be proficient, but after I talked to Christian Mehrstam (creator of Whitehack) I decided it had to be a specific object. So, at the beginning of the next session, the halfling specified that he was attuned to his elven rope. I said that if they lost the object, it would take a day of training to attune themselves to a new object.<br/><br/>3. Combat advantage is important to Deft characters, since it gives them the option to do double damage. Before, and including this session, we only used the simple roll-to-hit system, but after the bear attack I re-read the rules and found that some combat specials (feint and trip) trades this round's damage for a combat advantage next round. That gives +2 on to-hit and damage the second round, with double damage for the Deft combat specialist. Re-reading the rules after session 5 I also found that if the Deft rolls a successful double roll they get combat advantage next round. I keep finding these nuggets, and it feels like it improves the game from session to session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428922/#Comment_428922" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-28T05:53:56+00:00" title="February 28, 2014  5:53AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "little rules" I was referring to that you referenced were: deft attunements getting used once per day (I'd forgotten they were thus limited), con save to double healing rate (I was thinking it was just one HP each eve and morn), and I somehow got it in my head that the once-per-session(or is it day?) con save to decrease damage just negated it rather than reducing by 1d6.  After reading your account, I went back and reread the rules on each point and you were always correct and I was always wrong, and I even remembered the right rule upon my rereading (and that's after reading cover-to-cover twice!).  You're right that the rules are quite dense.  :-)<br/><br/>Regarding the use of specific vs. general attunements, I'd allow either one but give the player easier access to more impressive feats with more specific attunement.  I'm pretty sure the rules talk about that with regard to specific vs. general miracle descriptions so it seems like it's in keeping with the game's idiom.  Though specificity makes more sense with a signature weapon than "rope", I think.<br/><br/>It's neat what you're saying about how adoption of more and more of the rules improves your game.  It reminds me of expanding from "hub" to "spokes" in Burning Wheel.<br/><br/>Have your players read the rules?  I think that would help get more of the rules onto the table quickly.  <br/><br/>And have you thought about each player running two characters?

The example we discussed was using the rope as a lasso to catch an enemy during a fight. I first thought it would still require a roll, but since it's only once per day it's OK to just let the Deft character go on and do it. You could of course say that anyone could use a lasso that way with a roll, so I was probably overly strict in this particular hypothetical case.<br/><br/>My own guideline is that if it's something anyone can do with a roll, the Deft character can do it without a roll. If it's something that no-one can do, the Deft can do it with a dice roll, within reason. For example in the Skeleton Village, the halfling ricocheted a rock with his sling around a corner, hitting a skeleton he knew was there, but it required a regular to-hit roll. Another character could have tried it, but would miss automatically. \n<blockquote>I somehow got it in my head that the once-per-session(or is it day?) con save to decrease damage just negated it rather than reducing by 1d6.</blockquote>\nIt's once per battle, and you use the best of your Save or constitution. Also remember that if you fail you're incapable of acting for two rounds. This is neat because, as you saw in the actual play report, this means the players usually only use this option when they risk going to 0 HP. That is, when it's most dramatic.\n<blockquote>Regarding the use of specific vs. general attunements, I'd allow either one but give the player easier access to more impressive feats with more specific attunement.  I'm pretty sure the rules talk about that with regard to specific vs. general miracle descriptions so it seems like it's in keeping with the game's idiom.  Though specificity makes more sense with a signature weapon than "rope", I think.</blockquote>\nThat is definitely one way of doing it. I can argue for both allowing general and only specific items, but I'm going with specific at the moment to keep things simple. Even if you allow something general, it's only usable once per day, as we said above, so it's self-limiting. It isn't possible for the player to "abuse" the power to do spectacular things over and over. Even though they can pick up any rope, they can only do it once per day.\n<blockquote>Have your players read the rules?  I think that would help get more of the rules onto the table quickly.</blockquote>\nNo, they haven't, but I agree it would be good if they did. The main problem is that <i>I</i> have been looking things up between sessions, so I haven't wanted to lend the book to the players. I've even considered buying a second "players' copy" of the book to lend out. Another problem is that I want to use the two adventures in the rule book and the official setting, but I want the players to experience it rather than reading it. So far we're playing published modules, and I'm not adapting them to Whitehack's setting. Instead the PCs are walking south, stumbling on adventures using the setting in that particular module, and when I run out of modules the PCs will somehow enter the canonical setting.\n<blockquote>And have you thought about each player running two characters?  I'd be inclined to do that with so few players, just as insurance -- to limit lethality of the modules you're using.</blockquote>\nI haven't, no. There were supposed to be three players, but one cancelled the same day. I tried to get another player, and he was almost able to join, but couldn't. <br/><br/>I'm also wary of introducing dynamic duo PCs that are perfectly coordinated during battles because the same player is running them. But as long as you play both of them as real characters I guess it's just a shift of focus from "my one PC" to "my two PCs".<br/><br/>The second part of The Rescue had three players and next time a fourth player will join. The fourth player also owns the rules, which is nice. My plan with four players is that one or two players can be missing due to illness or other things, but we can still play the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428931/#Comment_428931" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-28T10:35:13+00:00" title="February 28, 2014 10:35AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, what's your experience of two characters per player?

He's playing a Strong Barbarian, extremely inspired by <a href="http://oglaf.wikia.com/wiki/Kronar" rel="nofollow">Kronar</a> (NSFW) from the web comic Oglaf (NSFW!). The barbarian even have a mule called Oglaf. The PCs name is Malena-Igor, son of Malena-Ivar, which is like being called Barbara-Igor or something. It's some kind of gender commentary from the player that I'm not sure I understood, possibly a reference to the men in Kronar's tribe giving birth.<br/><br/>Anyway, the stats:\n<blockquote><i>Malena-Igor, Level 2 Strong Barbarian</i><br/>Str 17 (Barbarian), Dex 13, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 6 (The Medicine Men of the Steppe), Cha 10; HP 8, AC 7, ST 15, Move 25, To-hit: +2; Hydra leather loincloth armor, Battle axe, Mule; 71 gp.</blockquote>\nThe session started with another round of rule fixes and additions on stuff I'd read since last session. I originally thought that picking a species (humans, elves, dwarfs, orcs, and so on; there are no races in Whitehack, only species) was mandatory at character creation. It turns out that if you play the standard species of the setting you don't get any attribute groups. The barbarian had assigned "Human" to strength and wisdom, which actually felt weird when he invoked during previous sessions. It's telling that I would have no problem with a dwarf that rolls double positive rolls for strength, but that it seemed strange that humans would do it. I think it exemplifies a subtle point in Whitehack, that all species are being compared to humans, or whatever baseline your setting has, to make a point about who is being privileged.<br/><br/>The main thing the barbarian player had used "Human" for was for wisdom, when doing first aid checks. So after a discussion with the group he removed "Human" and added "The medicine men from the steppe". It was important that they were all men, to keep up the Kronar references.<br/><br/>The other thing was picking a language. I hadn't bothered before, even though they met and talked to a band of goblin and troll treasure hunters during the first session, in the Pyramid of the Spider King. I decided in retrospect that the goblin chief had spoken the common language, but in the future I want languages to matter. It makes Wise characters more important, since they can learn extra languages. All players chose "Common" as the language.<br/><br/>The barbarian joined the others and the players started planning their assault. I had decided beforehand I would let this take whatever time it took, as it was the main focus of the session. I leaned back and listened to the players going over different options, answering questions when they wanted to know details about the guards' timing and so on. <br/><br/>I'll set the scene:<br/><br/>The fort was an old stone hunting castle, six meters high. It was surrounded by a 4 meter high wooden palisade, with equally high wooden towers in each corner. The palisade was 60 x 40 meters. There was 100 meters of open grass between the edge of the surrounding forest and the palisade, so it was placed in a big clearing. The PCs had seen 5 bandits entering the fort, two patrolling guards, one guard outside the gate and one on the inside. The bandits had been warned from the village and were expecting some kind of attack. The two patrolling guards started at the front gate, walk in different directions around the outside of the palisade, met in the back and returned to the front each on one side.<br/><br/>The players' (and PCs') final plan, after many alternatives, was to wait until dark, split up into two groups and sneak to positions close to the two back corners of the palisade. On one side the barbarian would wait. On the other side the halfling would attach his rope to the palisade and trip up one of the guards, which would signal to the duelist to attack the downed bandit and the barbarian to stealth attack the guard on his side. Stealth attack with a battle axe, that is. They hoped the guard in the front would go look what had happened, so they could kill him as well. The last thing the hafling said was "If something goes wrong, it's each man for himself. We'll retreat into the forest and regroup at the large oak tree we passed before." "Each man for himself, I like it!" said the barbarian.<br/><br/>I required a dexterity roll from each PC to sneak up to their positions without being detected by the guards. It was dark and they would sneak carefully, which should give them a bonus, but on the other hand the guards were expecting trouble and the PCs would have to get quite close, so I didn't give any modifications either way. The halfling passed his roll, as did the duelist. I wanted to activate "halfling" negatively on the dexterity roll, but once again the player argued it should be a double positive roll. I gave him that, but said that next time he would *have* to accept a double negative roll. The species are supposed to be both good and bad for the PC. The barbarian failed his sneak roll. The guard had spotted him and shouted that he should stand up.<br/><br/>Did the barbarian follow the plan to retreat? No, he didn't. Instead he ran towards the guard with his battle axe. The patrolling guard on the other side ran to the front gate to get to the other side, and hadn't detected the halfling and duelist. The halfling shot his crossbow at the running guard, getting an advantage for attacking an unaware enemy, but a disadvantage because it was dark, so it was a straight roll. He missed, but the arrow kept flying and the guards didn't notice. The duelist ran around the corner towards the front gate.<br/><br/>The barbarian's fight went spectacularly bad. During the next couple of rounds he missed the guard twice, while the guard hit him two times. He was down to his last few HPs.<br/><br/>The duelist rounded the corner and was attacked by the guard at the front gate. In two rounds the duelist missed twice, with the guard hitting twice, putting the duelist passed out at 0 HP.<br/><br/>The running guard rounded the second corner to help his friend with the barbarian. I asked the player if he wanted to retreat. I've heard that's what you sometimes do when you're outnumbered in OSR games. But the player didn't want that, but to stand and fight. Also, had he retreated both guards would get a free attack of opportunity anyway.<br/><br/>With two enemies flanking him they rolled with combat advantage (+2 to-hit and damage) and immediately put him at 0 HP, also passed out.<br/><br/>This left the halfling standing. He had run up to the palisade to peak around the corner towards the front gate, but realizing his odds were bad he retreated into the forest. He saw how the guards opened the gate and dragged the unconscious barbarian and duelist into the fort. Here's one of the drawbacks with the PCs falling unconscious at 0 HP, but not dying. If they die immediately, it's out of my hands, but with them being unconscious I must decide if they live or die. Some monsters will of course kill and eat them by default, but with human enemies I have to be an asshole. On the other hand, I like that I can go all in as GM in battles and leave the life or death decision for later. This time I thought about having the bandits immediately slit the throat of the barbarian and duelist, but that felt a bit extreme within the fiction. I decided they would alert their boss and let him decide, postponing the decision.<br/><br/>The session could have ended here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428975/#Comment_428975" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-01T08:24:34+00:00" title="March  1, 2014  8:24AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2014 11:26AM by Jonas Ferry.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One huge incentive for the halfling to get back to the village was that we have decided that new characters start at the current lowest level of the party. Since he was level 3, all new characters would be level 3.<br/><br/>But he wanted to try to rescue his friends and had two bottles of 1d6 HP healing potions, so he snuck back to the palisade. He used his rope to climb the palisade, but failed. I used the almost classic fail forward "halfway a guard spots you". He decided to keep going, and jumped onto a roof in the compound. He entered the building and found the stables, and tried to get the horses to panic to make them trample the guards in the courtyard. This failed without a roll, since I didn't feel like a hafling could frighten the horses that much by just punching and kicking them. The horses left the stables, but they didn't stampede.<br/><br/>After sneaking around a short while he decided to enter a large second-story window of the main building. Once again he failed his climb roll and once again he was spotted. He entered the window anyway, and saw the bandit leader with a bandit sidekick at the large table in the main hall. The halfling tried to jump to a balcony inside the main hall, when I said "I wonder if halflings really are that good at jumping?", invoking his species group negatively. He failed his roll, and fell to the floor 3 meters down with 1d6 damage.<br/><br/>This is a neat thing with how species work in Whitehack. The group now knows that halflings are good at climbing and sneaking, but not at jumping. Also, it's not certain it applies to all halflings in the setting. The next halfling PC might say "Pfft, jumping is easy for a Took, it's the Baggins who can't jump!" Suddenly we learn even more about the halfling species, without having to decide all this before playing.<br/><br/>Back to our halfling. The bandit leader and bandit sidekick drew their swords, and the bandit sidekick ran up to the halfing. We rolled initiative and the halfling won. He wanted to leave the room, but the bandit sidekick landed his attack of opportunity, putting the halfling at 0 HP.<br/><br/>So, now I had all three PCs unconscious at the feet of the bandits. What I didn't want was for them to be put in a cell, escaping, defeating the bandits. It would have felt cheap if failing didn't result in death; I mean, when would it otherwise? So I said "sorry guys, new characters next session". The players don't know what really happened to their characters, only that they're dead.<br/><br/>I realized that the PC missed all their attack rolls, while the bandits hit almost all of them, doing decent damage with 1d6 weapons. Both the PCs and NPCs had slightly less than 50% chance to hit, so it's pretty improbable that they would all fail. The reason I realized this is because I didn't have to roll HPs for any of the bandits.<br/><br/>Are there other official D&amp;D games or OSR games where the GM is put in this position of slitting the throat of unconscious PCs at 0 HP? What would you have done in this situation?<br/><br/>We had a great session! The players enjoyed it a lot, even the, let's say, less than perfect outcome. Next session we'll create new characters for four players, all starting at level 1. They'll try to do what their predecessors couldn't, and I'm very curious what kind of characters the players will create.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429447/#Comment_429447" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-13T13:34:22+00:00" title="March 13, 2014  1:34PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2014 4:21AM by Jonas Ferry.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last session ended in a total party kill, so this session we created PCs for four players. One player has just joined the group.<br/><br/>The PCs were:<br/><br/><i>Lanfred, Level 1 Strong Strong Man</i><br/>Str 15 (Strong Man), Dex 14, Con 9, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8 (Hack); HP 8, AC 5, ST 16, Move 30, To-hit: +2; Chainmail, Adventure Kit, Warhammer, Strong Man Equipment; 54 gp.<br/><br/><i>Vralgo, Level 1 "Strong" Archer</i><br/>Str 11, Dex 11 (Archer), Con 7 (2nd Company Archers), Int 9, Wis 12 (Beggars &amp; Petty Thieves), Cha 7; HP 8, AC 7, ST 16, Move 30, To-hit: +1; Leather Armor, Adventure Kit, Longbow, Arrows, -13 gp.<br/><br/><i>Kardash, Level 1 Wise Spirit Mage</i><br/>Str 6, Dex 10, Con 6, Int 13 (Black Mantelus' Order of Wizards), Wis 10 (Spirit Mage), Cha 12; HP 7, AC 7, ST 15, Move 30, To-hit: 0; Miracles: Ifrit, Djinn of Fire; (Transfer Life Force); Leather Armor, Adventure Kit, Scrolls &amp; Writing Equipment, Crossbow, Scimitar; 18 gp.<br/><br/><i>Zeveran, Level 1 Half-Demon Templar</i><br/>Str 15 (Half-Demon), Dex 13, Con 8, Int 11 (Templar), Wis 7, Cha 8; HP 8, AC 2, ST 16, Move 20, To-hit: +2; Full Plate, Adventure Kit, Shield, Sword, Sack, Crowbar; 10 gp.<br/><br/>If someone wants to keep track of the players from last time:<br/><br/>Barbarian -&gt; Strong Man<br/>Duelist -&gt; Archer<br/>Halfling -&gt; Spirit Mage<br/>New player -&gt; Half-Demon <br/><br/>Some short notes on the PCs: Lanfred is a classical strong man with fake weights that he uses when he performs. The player played him with a squeaky voice to comical effect. Vralgo is a murder hobo, really. He was a member of the king's archers but was ousted. Kardash can summon spirits that either takes physical form or possesses weapons. Zeveran has one human and one demon parent. He was a templar, but was discharged when they found out about his background. All of them have really low constitution and the Strong PCs all have low charisma. All players were sighing and breathing heavily all session, which was hilarious.<br/><br/>We've made a bunch of small and large changes since the last session. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>The first was on rolling attributes. Last time we rolled 3d6 in order, re-rolling the whole line if the player wasn't happy. This time we discussed a bunch of variants. We wanted the players to be able to decide their concept beforehand, but still risk low attribute scores. We settled on 3d6 in any order, place the attribute after each roll, keep the line no matter what. I makes rolling the attributes exciting because you don't know if you should put 13 in strength since you might roll higher later, or not. The average attributes for the PCs in the above order: 11.3, 9.5, 9.5, 10.3. Not very impressive. We also decided to not roll HP on level 1, but take the class maximum. From level 2 and onward they will roll for HP.<br/><br/>The second was on encumbrance. Whitehack uses item weights in pounds, and when you carry a certain total weight you lower the movement rate according to a table. It's simple, but neither the players nor me wanted to keep track of the item weights. I suggested they create "kits", like a travelling kit and and battle kit, with pre-calculated weights, but instead we borrowed ideas from Lamentations of the Flame Princess and added equipment slots. So the basic movement rate for humans is 9 meters per round; oh yeah, we switched to the metric system as well. Light armor (e.g. leather) lowers max movement by 1 m, medium armor (e.g. chainmail) by 2 m, and heavy armor (full plate) by 3 m. Armor doesn't take up any equipment slots. Slots 0-5 are free, 6-10 lowers movement from 9 m to 6 m, 11-15 to 3 m, and 16+ to 0 m. So armor doesn't affect how much you can carry, it just lowers your maximum movement. When your encumbrance passes the armor, the armors stops mattering to movement.<br/><br/>200 small items like coins and rings take up one slot. Medium weapons (e.g. swords) take up one slot. Large weapons (e.g. two-handed swords) take up two slots. I originally said that 200 arrows take up one slot since I didn't want to bother with counting them, but I'll suggest 20 arrows next session. I want arrows to be a limited resource for tactical reasons. One player wrote up a sack in one slot, but next session I'll suggest something else: slots 0-5 you can carry on your body, but 6-10 and 11-15 requires a backpack and a sack each, but they don't take up slots. If the players number their equipment it's easy to see what happens if they for example lose their sack.<br/><br/>I also prepared the adventure kits you see on the PCs above. An adventure kit is a special "item" that costs 25 gp (prices from Whitehack's equipment list) and takes up one slot. It contains: Backpack, 5 bandages, flint &amp; steel, 5 trail rations, 15 m hemp rope, sack, sleeping bag, 6 torches, 2 liter waterskin. It's a basic kit all adventurers need, and it sped up character creation since the players didn't have to think about those things.<br/><br/>The story started with the PCs joining the village elder in a quiet moment by three newly dug, very small graves. He told the PCs about the bandits' attack more than a week back and how the village girl Rosita was kidnapped. Three adventures set off to free her, but a couple of days later the bandits returned by horse and threw down the heroes' decapitated heads. The villagers buried the heads outside the village. The PCs happily accepted the mission!<br/><br/>They set off into the woods and at the same spot as the two PCs met the bear in session one I rolled on the encounter table from the module. The same bear mother and cub appeared. This time the PCs managed to dispose of the 26 HP bear with only one PC losing 2 HP. We have used free attacks (attacks of opportunity) before, but they became more important in this fight. The strong-man and the templar stood at the front line, with the archer and the spirit mage a few meters back doing ranged attacks. For the bear's first attack I rolled randomly who she would attack, and it was the spirit mage. Since he was in the back line the players thought that the front line PCs should get free attacks as the bear passed through the line. I agreed, and that helped them out. I hope that positions and formations play a bigger role in future fights, as it adds a nice tactical element.<br/><br/>One thing I regret now is that I let the strong-man kill the cub after the fight without a roll and gave him XP for it. I don't want to encourage the players to kill everything they see; they should get XPs for fleeing enemies. Also, the bear cup wasn't a threat to the PCs, so it shouldn't give them XPs. I'll keep this in mind in the future.<br/><br/>The PCs scouted the hunting castle and when five bandits exited on horse some of the PCs wanted to attack the riders right away while others wanted to ambush them on their return. The PCs didn't act quickly enough, so when the riders rode past them they decided on the ambush plan. They found a nice spot for the ambush, prepared a rope across the path to trip up the horses, and found some higher ground for the archer and spirit mage armed with a crossbow. The spirit mage used the waiting time to perform a ritual to summon a fire spirit to fight on the PCs side.<br/><br/>We've had a wise PC before, with the miracle "Speak with the dead". I thought it was very nice, but the miracle was only used once when questioning a skull in the Skeleton Village module. Then we agreed that the PC could ask one question per HP spent. The player could spend the HPs one after the other, so she didn't need to pay all up front if she wanted to ask follow-up questions.<br/><br/>This time we had a group discussion on the result of this instance of the fire spirit miracle, and the HP cost. We decided that the PC could summon a fire spirit for 1d6 rounds by paying 1d6 HP. I first suggested 1d6 HP for as many rounds, but one player correctly noted that it's more fun when you can get a really cheap or expensive result by rolling the cost and duration separately. Since it was a ritual we decided he would pay 1d6-1 HP (minimum 1). I was thinking I would lower the cost to 1 HP, but first of all it would make all other preparations useless, like expensive ingredients, drugs, and so on. Second, it would make it very easy with a slightly higher PC level to summon ten of them to a fight, and that would make the miracle very powerful. One nice thing with Whitehack is that you take the caster's level into account, so when the PC levels up we can redo the HP costs if we think they are too harsh now. It's harder to do the other way around; if a level 1 wise PC can perform powerful miracles they will become very powerful by level 3. I'll document the miracles we use for my own sake, and suggest that the player do the same on the character sheet, and hopefully we'll build up a catalog of specific miracle uses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429448/#Comment_429448" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-13T13:34:30+00:00" title="March 13, 2014  1:34PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2014 1:35PM by Jonas Ferry.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            During the ambush the PCs managed to trip up two horses with the rope, and their riders didn't get a chance to act during the whole fight since they were thrown to the ground and pinned under their horses. The PCs and the fire spirit disposed of the others before they could even draw their weapons. We used the rules for surprise on page 11. I rolled a separate initiative for the fire spirit, but one player suggested that summoned creatures could use the same initiative as the caster to simplify things. I agreed, and we also decided that the player whose PC summoned the creature would control it during the fight. It seems a lot more fun than if the GM would do it.<br/><br/>When the fire spirit attacked a bandit I had the player roll to hit with +1 since I counted the fire spirit as a 1 HD monster. Another option, I realized later, would have been to skip the to-hit roll and let the bandit roll to save instead. I don't know which one I prefer yet. The fire spirit missed anyway. These are things that can affect the miracle cost as well, if the miracle requires a to-hit roll, if the target is allowed to save, and so on.<br/><br/>One interesting thing is that three of the four players now play a Strong character, and all of them picked melee option nr 1 for their slot. Nr 1 is two attacks if the PC doesn't move during the round. One of the Strong PCs is an archer, but nr 1 still works for him. There are some melee options that doesn't work for ranged characters, but I'll either let the player pick around them or have him specialize in melee as well. I don't want to rewrite the options for ranged combat, but we'll see. After the session we realized that we all forgot the Strong specialty that if they lower an opponent to 0 HP they can immediately perform a new attack.<br/><br/>The session ended with the four PCs hiding in the forest, scouting out the hunting castle during the night. Same ending as session one, but with a brave new bunch of heroes. Next time, in two weeks, we'll see if they do better than their predecessors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430676/#Comment_430676" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T04:56:12+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  4:56AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Rescue, part IV</b><br/><br/>Before the session me and the players designed our own encumbrance system. In Whitehack all equipment and treasure is measured in pounds, and a carried weight of 76, 101, or 151+ pounds lowers the character's movement rate. The basic movement rate is different for normal sized people, like humans, and smaller people, like dwarves and halflings. Strength doesn't affect carrying capacity, but you can roll strength to improve the movement rate by one level for one round. The players all said it would be too tedious to track the weight of each item, so we designed a slot system inspired by Lamentations of the Flame Princess.<br/><br/>Each PC has a maximum movement rate based on their species. Normal sized species have movement 9 meters per round and small species (dwarves, halflings) have movement 6 m/rd. Armor decreases movement, but do not add to encumbrance, which start at 9 m/rd for all species. You carry five slots per encumbrance level. Slot 0-5 give movement 9 m/rd, slot 6-10 give 6 m/rd, slot 11-15 give 3 m/rd, and slot 16+ give 0 m/rd. Strength 13+ give an extra slot per encumbrance level and 16+ give two extra slots. Small items (coins, rings, jewels) can be carried 200 per slot. Normal items (sword, shield) take up one slot. 20 items of ammunition (quiver with arrows, bolts, sling stones) take up one slot. Large items (two-handed sword, halberd) take up two slots.<br/><br/>A special case is the adventure kit, which is a backpack and a sack with basic items. It only takes up one slot. The items are (items and prices from Whitehack): <br/><br/>Backpack,\t5 gp<br/>Bandages (5), 2 gp<br/>Flint &amp; steel, 5 gp<br/>Rations, trail (5), 5 gp<br/>Rope hemp, 15 m, 1 gp<br/>Sack, 1 gp<br/>Sleeping bag, 2 gp<br/>Torches (6), 1 gp<br/>Waterskin, 2 l, 3 gp<br/><br/>Total cost is 25 gp. Two benefits with the adventure kit is that it makes it more probable that the PCs will have stuff they need to do their adventures, and it's faster to buy at character creation. We avoided special equipment like lock picks and a grappling hook, so that interested PCs can get them if they want to.<br/><br/>Armor decrease maximum movement according to the following table:<br/><br/>Shield, 0<br/>Cloth, 0<br/>Leather, -1<br/>Studded Leather, -1<br/>Chainmail, -2<br/>Splint Mail, -2<br/>Full Plate, -3<br/><br/>For example, a dwarf has movement 6 m/rd. In chainmail that's 4 m/rd. If he fills 0-5 slots, his movement is still 4 m/rd, same with 6-10 items, but at 11-15 items his movement is 3 m/rd as the encumbrance surpasses the species and armor movement rate.<br/><br/>The session started at dawn with the PCs watching the hunting castle. I had the players roll to see if the horses they tripped last session were all OK, something I thought of between sessions. It was hard to assign a percentage. Horses are tripped all the time in cowboy films, and I suspect that wild horses fall in nature without breaking their legs. On the other hand I have a feeling that horses that have fallen and hurt their legs are not useful anymore, and I also wanted to add an element of risk to the idea of tripping up horses to ambush people, if you want to keep the horses around afterwards. The players rolled on 50-50 for the three horses and all were OK.<br/><br/>Through the night the PCs heard the bandits sing and laugh, and at the dawn they only had two guards half asleep at the gate. The PCs discussed if they should try to sign up to the bandit gang and attack them from within, wait for more riders and ambush them as well, do a frontal attack, or sneak in. Both the group of players and PCs lack an obvious leader, which is not a bad thing as it keeps things democratic, but it makes it more difficult to reach decisions when every player has their own suggestion. The Half-Demon started executing his sneak idea, and the other two players (the Archer was missing) went along. This time the bandits didn't expect an attack like they did last time. Last time the barkeep's son in the village Zerim rode out to warn the bandits about the PCs, but this time they didn't do the same things in the village so he didn't get a chance.<br/><br/>The PCs entered the hunting castle and basically one by one killed the remaining four bandits, the bandit leader, and (unknowingly) the barkeep's son. Most of the bandits were attacked by surprise, fixing breakfast or sleeping, so most of them couldn't attack back. They were 1 HD monsters, which means 1d6 HP. The PC's weapons do around 1d6 of damage, so one attack was often enough, especially since I gave them combat advantage which gives +2 to hit and damage. The bandit leader was a 2 HD monster, but he mirrored the previous PCs pitiful fight by missing every attack, while the Strong Man hit most of his with his warhammer.<br/><br/>The PCs rescued the village girl Rosita, searched the castle for treasure, rounded up all twelve horses, and left for Zerim to collect their reward. My own rules for searching is that the player can choose between describing where the PC searches or roll for example wisdom or intelligence. If the player describes the PC searching the correct spot, the PC finds the hidden object. If the player rolls and succeeds I'll give the player suggestions where to look, but the player still needs to describe it. I've had these rules from the start, but they haven't been used. That is, no player has decided to roll to get suggestions. The suggestions would be of the form "Perhaps under the bed? Or there's something hidden in the closet? Or behind the painting on the wall?", where one of them would be correct. My idea is that the player can describe the search and then roll if they want to, or go straight to the roll. But I don't want them to step into a room, roll, and then I give them all the hidden stuff straight away.<br/><br/>The PCs found 70 gp, 1120 sp, 2350 cp, three rings worth 40 sp each, a necklace worth 125 sp, and a golden brooch with a red jewel worth 2400 sp. <br/><br/>Back in Zerim, the village elder reminded them of the current deal, that they could keep 10 % of the treasure and hand the rest back to the villagers. One PC wanted to make the villagers feel ashamed for claiming that the treasure was stolen from this poor village, but he had a hard time affecting their emotions after the PCs had the delivered the chopped off head of the barkeep's son with the rest of the bandits' as proof. The PCs reluctantly gave back 90 % of the treasure, but of course kept all the XP (1 gp = 1 XP).<br/><br/>They also received their agreed upon reward that the villagers had collected: 200 sp. Since 10 sp is 1 gp, the PCs got 5 gp (and XP) each. This is the cost of a backpack! The reason is I'm using the treasures from the adventure module to Drakar och Demoner, but the prices from Whitehack. On the other hand, the adventure modules of Drakar och Demoner always had a lot of treasure, so you got rich quick. If you look at the Drakar and Demoner rules the bandit treasure is the size of a dragon's treasure.<br/><br/>The player who wanted to shame the villagers later quoted Seven Samurai in an email regarding the size of the reward and how the treasure was split:<br/><br/><b>Kambei Shimada</b>: So. Again we are defeated.<br/><i>[Shichiroji looks puzzled at Kambei]</i><br/><b>Kambei Shimada</b>: The farmers have won.

The idea is that slot 1-5 is carried on the body, 6-10 in the backpack, and 11-15 in the sack in at least one hand. This means that if you ditch the backpack and the sack to run faster, we know what items you left behind for the orcs. You'll probably carry your main weapons, up to 200 coins, and so on, on your body, which is good to know if you lose everything else.<br/><br/>The adventure kit is again a bit special. It takes up one body slot, but since it contains the backpack and sack it enables the use of slots 6-15. All other items in the adventure kit count as if they're carried in the backpack, in case you drop it. Moving an item from one slot to another takes a turn in battle. Moving an item from the backpack to the hands also takes a turn. The hands doesn't count as body slots though, so you can still keep the rope noted on the backpack even if you're using it at the moment. Since you'll only hold one or two things in your hands at a time it's easy to mentally keep track of, so there's no need to erase it from the backpack and put it in a body slot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430779/#Comment_430779" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T01:13:11+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  1:13AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A list of observations after seven sessions of play, four of the session in the above adventure The Rescue:<br/><br/>* Even though I've suggested it a couple of times in fights, no player has used the special combat options push, charge, feint, trip, disarm, fight defensively/offensively, protect, or grapple. I think that, since most of the options forsakes damage this round to get a special move next round, they don't fit with the "must kill the enemy as quickly as possible" desperation that colors our fights. Level 1 PCs go down on a good hit or two, so there's less time for finesse. Players of Deft characters should be interested in the special combat options, because some of them give combat advantage next round, which is very good for a combat oriented Deft PC.<br/><br/>* The book says "The base experience points awarded for monsters are listed in Table 10", but it doesn't say exactly what they are awarded for. Facing the monster, overcoming the monster, killing the monster? This is not a bad thing, since it enables different types of play, but it leaves some game design to the GM. My current rule is that the PCs get XP when they overcome monsters, because I don't want them to have to kill every last enemy. Monster XP is low anyway, 30 XP for a 1 HD monster like skeletons, goblins, and human bandits. For a level 1 PC they can be tough to kill, but a Strong PC needs 2000 XP for level 2, which equals 67 human bandits. Also, the book doesn't say if every participant in the fight gets 30 XP or if you divide it between all PCs (and NPCs). Our current rule is that the XPs are divided, how is totally decided by the players. They can give all XP to one PC to level it up, spread them evenly, or give it to the PC who did most of the damage, or anyway they want. If NPCs have helped out, I take an equal share, say 25% if there's one NPC and three PCs.<br/><br/>* In the beginning it was difficult, and new players are still confused when they start playing, that there're two different resolution systems for tasks and combat. To perform a task you roll 1d20 equal or under the attribute. You want to roll as high as possible, since higher is better, up to a point. If you hit your attribute score exactly it's a perfect roll, but a 20 is an abysmal failure. In combat you roll 1d20 + base hit bonus + modifiers, equal or higher than the opponents 19 - AC. Rolling a 20 is a critical hit (not an abysmal failure as with tasks) and a 1 is a fumble. For example, a starting Strong character with strength below 13 that hits a human bandit (AC 6) would roll 1d20 + 1 equal or higher than 13. But as we've played for a while I've gotten used to switching modes between the resolution systems, and don't find it difficult anymore. It's actually quite fun to go into "battle mode".<br/><br/>* We haven't used auctions yet. This one's on me, and as GM I should push for auctions when they're relevant. We're playing modules written for a game without auctions, so it's easier to translate the rolls into straight task resolution. I'm sure we'll stumble on a situation where an auction will feel perfect later on. When we do, I'll use the author's suggested change and add a hidden 1d6 to each side to make the auction more interesting.<br/><br/>* The species system, the Deft attunements, and the magic system all require "game design" either while playing or between sessions. As GM I find myself thinking about how I could've handled past situations differently and future situations better. We don't have any Deft PCs at the moment, so I don't have to bother with that. The species system clicked when we had a halfling PC. Now it's the magic system, and assigning an HP cost to spells, that has me thinking. The game allows me to either come up with a strict system and present it to the player, or come up with the HP cost for each spell on the fly. Even if I come with a prepared system there will be a negotiation, since the player can increase or decrease the cost by increasing damage or duration, or by performing a ritual with expensive ingredients. The main thing for me has been to let go of the notion that I need to be perfectly consistent with the HP cost. If I realize a spell has been too cheap I can always increase the cost later in the name of game balance. If I, by mistake, let the PC summon a mighty demon for 1 HP and the player starts messing up every fight I can always increase the cost and say that the available demons are running out. This limits analysis paralysis while assigning HP costs at the table; now I just go with what feels right at the moment and postpone worrying until there's an actual game balance problem.<br/><br/>* Combat oriented Deft characters can do double damage in combat, and critical hits also do double damage. These two stack, according to the rules. But it's not clear if "double" means that you roll damage once and multiply by 2 or if you roll damage twice and add together. A Deft character getting a critical hit could either roll once and multiply by 4 or roll damage four times and add together. We're using a middle path. On a critical hit you roll damage twice and add together, and if you're a combat-oriented Deft PC you roll damage once more and add, so damage is rolled three times. I like that damage from critical hits lump together in the middle of the distribution curve, rather than swinging wildly from one end or the other depending on the roll. Using multiplication it's more likely to roll a 1 for 2 damage than it is if your roll 2d6 of damage and add together. It's also harder to get an extremely high result, but on average a critical hit is a lot better than a normal hit when using addition.<br/><br/>* I really like the included setting and I want to use it, but for the foreseeable future I'll run classical Drakar och Demoner modules. I don't want to convert all of them to the eternal winter setting, or to the nice and weird vampire orcs, so when I run out of modules I'll probably teleport the group into the setting or start over with new PCs. If I were sandboxing and improvising I would use the default setting, but doing it now would get in the way of experiencing the modules as written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430789/#Comment_430789" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T05:55:04+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  5:55AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2014 5:55AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonas, do you feel like the special combat options would get more use if they were more mechanically advantageous?  I haven't played yet I had the same impression from reading them that your players seem to have had.  They're sort of neat, but seem like usually a bad idea.  There's a system of trade-off balance in place that prevents them from ever being better than just vanilla attacks.<br/><br/>I'd award monster XP for anything that feels like the obstacle was overcome -- killing, running them off, befriending them, whatever.  Avoiding them and leaving them as a threat doesn't count (though that has it's own reward too).  It's interesting that you'd "take" a share of XP for your NPC but have no hand in the distribution otherwise.  I'm inclined to stay entirely out of how the PCs distribute treasure and take full-charge of XP -- even distribution with maybe half-shares for hirelings or whatever.<br/><br/>I feel like the two resolution systems is an inelegance of the system but I don't see a great way to replace the to-hit system with the normal mechanic that includes AC as a vital element.<br/><br/>Can't you use an auction in any multi-party conflict?  I'd look for even combats where the general shape of the outcome is certain (usually, players will certainly win), but the side-conditions are variable.  If goblin A wins the auction, you still defeat them but he's succeeded at banging the sacred gong.  If goblin B wins, he's successfully lead the poisoners into you and now you're suffering from their attacks.  If you win, none of the above.  That kind of thing.  Am I misremembering how that works?<br/><br/>I've also been thinking about HP costs of miracles and wondering about consistency.  I decided that when we get there, my inconsistency can at least somewhat be waved away by asserting that ambient magic ebbs and flows through the world.  And if I do set some precedent that feels like I've given the PCs too much power -- the powerful demon for one HP as you suggest, then I can also give that power to NPCs who oppose the players.  Verisimilitude and balance all in one.<br/><br/>I really do need to get this to the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430858/#Comment_430858" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-11T14:29:17+00:00" title="April 11, 2014  2:29PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The next adventure has its own thread: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19352/whitehack-in-the-jaws-of-the-dragon" rel="nofollow">[Whitehack] In the Jaws of the Dragon</a><br/><br/>Adventure-specific questions go in the appropriate thread, but I'll answer general Whitehack questions in either thread.<br/><br/>Christopher, it's getting late here, so I want to get back to your questions over the weekend.

Instead of a straight dexterity roll for sneaking or a regular attack from combat advantage, you could alternate bids and describe how the PC sneaks and the guard guards, followed by one roll to resolve the situation, probably wisdom for the guard to see if the guard notices the PC. What you're doing is basically deciding if the situation is resolved by the PC's dexterity or the guard's wisdom. But so far we've used the previous methods, since we're more used to them.<br/><br/>Also, we haven't had a situation where the PCs were certain to win; even a fight with a single orc is dangerous since their 1d6 of damage can put a PC close to being out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
