I only had two players, but they are two of my best. We used the God-Kings of War oracle, and ended up with a basic setting wherein during the aftermath of a major battle, the losing army was left to pick themselves back up, and they were visited by three mystics: from the east, two of the giant female warrior-monks of the red-robed Order of the Eastern Tower, and from the west, the famed Spirit-talker Kalashman-Enlil, keeper of hunting birds.<br/><br/>My PCs were the ppirit-talker and a veteran of the losing side, who, having recovered from a seemingly-fatal wound, was beginning to wonder just how human he was. My major NPCs were the two monks (one older, one younger), a berserker veteran of many wars who had grown tired of battle (and who had killed the old God-Emperor), a captain of the PC veteran's unit, a ghost from that same unit, and the Spirit of Carnage that had infected the berserker.<br/><br/>My major conflicts --arising from best interests -- were: 1) that the spirit-talker wanted to deliver a message to the elder monk, but the younger monk wanted to prevent that; 2) the spirit-talker wanted to put the spirits of the dead to rest; 3) the veteran wanted to kill the berserker for betraying them in battle, and the berserker wanted to kill the veteran for witnessing his shame (whatever that meant, precisely), and the captain wanted to keep the berserker alive; 4) the veteran wanted to find out more about how magic had been responsible for his side's loss; 5) the older monk wanted to kill the "unknowing prince", who I had originally intended on being the veteran soldier, but it got away from me mid-play; 5) the berserker, driven by the carnage demon, wanted to kill the spirit-talker.<br/><br/>So, oracle-consulting and character creation went smoothly, but then once we got down to actual play, I had a hard time framing scenes to result in conflict. Even though many of the characters had opposing best interests, I just found it difficult to put those characters together and shake them up enough to enter conflict. I was also unclear on how to force conflict that wasn't specifically violent. Is it fair game to say "I try to convince you to help me protect these people" and then roll, say, Covertly and For others? Also, can you change forms in the middl eof a conflict, or are you stuck with the ones you picked at the outset? If you lose the conflict, can you "escalate" DitV-style?<br/><br/>Overall, we had a great time with the game, I just felt that it was a lot harder to drive things to conflict, unlike DitV, which tends to drop conflict like leaves in September.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257357/#Comment_257357" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-20T17:03:57+00:00" title="February 20, 2010  5:03PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Convincing" is too broad.

Offer him the advantage on a plate. Bamf! Of course, for maximum effect, have a character with a different BI stand in the way.<br/>---<br/>I'm not sure you can do that. The game says you roll when someone takes <i>concrete action</i>. Is convincing the other character taking concrete action, that drives the PC closer to his BI and creates a conflict? If it's not, then don't roll, move on, push the characters into situations where they have to start acting or lose everything. Make them DO SOMETHING about it. It's a hard game.<br/>---<br/>Everyone rolls; if you have to answer, you answer with the dice you rolled. On the next round, if you take a different action, you roll new dice from action-appropriate forms. At least that's how I remember it. But you certainly don't "escalate" DitV style, you don't get new dice on top of the old ones, you get different dice because you're doing something different. The old dice go away.

My players and I are more used to traditional games where the GM is creating adversity (and a storyline) for PCs that are more or less cooperative.  So as characters get created, the players aren't thinking about building in conflict, especially with each other.  As a result I find myself creating NPCs who will both create conflict and somehow tie the PC's stories together, which in turns reinforces the PCs cooperate/NPCs create adversity/GM's responsible for the narrative habits.  In the end, the game felt a little flat because the PCs didn't have much reason to interact other than having NPC adversaries in common.  After we debriefed our last session, one of the players suggested that next time I be a lot more explicit about what kind of PC creation is needed to drive the game.  <br/><br/>While reading the original post, I found myself wondering what brought the spirit-talker and the veteran into conflict, or if not outright conflict, then some sort of tension.  <br/><br/>I find it easier to wrap my head around how conflicts apply to non-physical situations if I parallel physical and non-physical conflicts with physical and emotional abuse.  When the verb changes from convince or persuade to browbeat or guilt-trip, the dice come out.  So instead of "I convince you to help me protect these people" it becomes "I make you feel like a creep for not protecting these people" or "I publicly shame you for not helping these people".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257383/#Comment_257383" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T00:11:32+00:00" title="February 21, 2010 12:11AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Beason</cite>While reading the original post, I found myself wondering what brought the spirit-talker and the veteran into conflict, or if not outright conflict, then some sort of tension.</blockquote>\nMy Carnage Demon came to the veteran in a dream and said "So, you think mystics were responsible for the carnage?

If you have 5 or six players, you may not even need NPCs. When NPCs come into conflict with each other, make sure it happens 'on camera' with the PCs right in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring character creation with new players, you really have to be explicit and tell them that their best interests should be a *direct attack* against another named character. By direct attack, I mean you want to do something to them, or want something from them, that they cannot ignore. The first time or two someone plays, require every best interest to be an attack on someone else. All of the characters should start within easy walking distance of everyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as others have said, not every scene needs a conflict, especially in the first half of the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257422/#Comment_257422" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T10:33:37+00:00" title="February 21, 2010 10:33AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2010 10:34AM by Christian_Griffen.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're on the right track with your NPCs.

When the spotlight's on you (whether as a PC who's just been asked "what do you do?", or as a GM describing the actions of an NPC), you've got to jump on it right away and DO SOMETHING. <br/><br/>I think telling people to remember that you're producing "short stories" is a good thing. Those stories don't have a lot of exposition or character-building moments. They open with the action right away (though action doesn't necessarily mean violence or conflict, just meaningful interactions between the major players in the story). So, if one character wants to marry another character's daughter, the very first scene should be something like that character coming to the father and asking for his daughter's hand in marriage. Or maybe climbing in through the window to kidnap her. Something like that.<br/><br/>And then "fade out" on the chapter earlier rather than later. Let later chapters fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>By the way, some people here seem to be saying that they're switching up dice from round to round in an action sequence. I'm no IaWA expert, but I'm pretty sure that the intent of the rules is that you pick up your dice at the beginning and you keep rolling those same dice until it's through.

In one scene, a character was searching an empty room for proof that another character was a poisoner.  We considered making an NPC called The Kitchen (The cupboard says, "ONYFDA!"), but instead had the searcher rolling against the poisoner, with narration about evidence or the lack thereof.  Felt strange, since the poisoner wasn't actually present, but it worked.  We used the technique again when someone was trying to save someone else from the effects of a poison.<br/><br/>One thing that was a little flat was the big finish.  We had a conflict, realized it was getting late and that the final scene actually resolved a lot of best interests, and decided to call it.

I call it "reasonable NPC disorder." I often end up making NPCs who, however bad ass they may be, are willing to listen to reason and at least attempt to negotiate. This is fine for some styles of games, but often ends up letting the PCs talk themselves out of drama. <br/><br/>In IAWA, I found that when I did that the game didn't go so well. So I started making NPCs who would stab you in the face for your shoes. Or, as Christian suggested, who would stab another NPC who you liked in the face for their shoes, and then taunt you about wearing the shoes of your dead friend. And while it isn't all literally face stabbing and shoe stealing, the NPCs are often aggressive, motivated to do harm, and active in going after what they want as often as possible while preventing themselves from being stabbed in the face. <br/><br/>And that right there was the difference, for me, between dry conflicts that just exist to cause conflicts and conflicts that made shit explode: NPCs who had goals that they were aggressively pursuing, and who telegraphed their pursuit. I often have initial setup scenes with NPCs who I'm going to be stealing shoes with in which they show what sorts of folks they're going to be without necessarily initiating a conflict in that scene. I establish them as aggressive, willing to cause harm (for good reasons or bad), and actively moving towards a goal. Then when later in the game that goal comes up, and the NPC is all with the knife and the "give me your shoes bitch" everyone knows where it is coming from. It isn't a sardoodledom moment of the plot/desire for some dice to roll makes me force a conflict. It is a moment when an aggressive, goal oriented NPC who we've seen being motivated steps up and starts acting like the raging asshole swords and sorcery badass they are. <br/><br/>Its probably also worth noting that this was a bit of a shift for some of the folks I usually play with, who were more used to being able to be the ones who initiated shit. When all of a sudden they couldn't hang back and bide their time, talk the reasonable NPCs down, and realized that they were going to lose their shoes right fucking now if they didn't get with the face stabby, it caused some shift in the way they played. But it also didn't happen all at once, it took us several games to really get it going, and for them to stop making reasonable PCs and start making unreasonable ones. <br/><br/>And that's where IAWA cooks, for me -- when unreasonable characters of all sorts decide to get active and take what they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258500/#Comment_258500" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T10:47:01+00:00" title="February 25, 2010 10:47AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Its probably also worth noting that this was a bit of a shift for some of the folks I usually play with, who were more used to being able to be the ones who initiated shit.

Its a mistake to assume that adversity is interesting just because it's adverse or aimed at making conflict.

However, I think it applies just as much to the players as it does to the GM of IaWA, and possibly more so. The couple of games I've seen flounder were because the PCs weren't willing to be all desperate and unreasonable.<br/><br/>I've had the "reasonable NPC" problem in other games, too, although sometimes it was that they were TOO reasonable and too diplomatic, and convinced the PCs over to their side, which ruined any kind of building conflict. That one's annoying, too. I'm trying to portray the NPC convincingly, and, instead, end up convincing the player that the NPC is right. Whereas I was really hoping to get them riled up and start a fight or something.<br/><br/>So, that's one I'm taking home: don't be afraid to let your character(s) (whether PC or NPC) get desperate and irrational. The game needs it, more often than not.<br/><br/>(I just played a very odd session of IaWA last night, which is relevant to this discussion, I think.
