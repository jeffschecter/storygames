                    I was reading the new Douglas Coupland Novel, Jpod in the airport while being delayed last night on my way back from training in West Virginia, and was struck, not for the first time, that whatever I read I want to make into a game. That in itself is a very Coupland Character sort of thing. So I got a map to the airport and was thinking about what Coupland Characters would do when stuck in an airport. the game would be about growing up without loosing your identity. the ideas I am working with are a total rip off of My Life With Master except for the humiliating GM. I figure that anyone who is enough of a geek to want to be a Coupland Character can make their own life miserable. <br/> <br/>So the character has five points to divide between three traits: Moxie, which is your ability to do things you can do anything you can think of unless it would break the character out of the as yet undetermined finish criteria, Enuie which keeps you from doing things, and Cool which makes your friends like you. the player also picks three areas of interests.<br/> <br/>The method of the game is that each of the players take turns coming up with things to do in the airport to kill time while waiting. All Die rolls are D6 and a 5 or a 6 is a success. A player can roll in an interest or a relationship if it is appropriate. Everyone who wants their character to be involved in the scene rolls their Enuie dice. If any of their dice is success then they can get the gumption to participate. If no one makes the roll the player who called the contest can roll his cool and if he makes a success then everyone is in.if the scene is a contest, the person who gets the most points gets a point of cool everyone else gets a point of enuie. <br/> <br/>A player can also try to GROW. They can call for a scene where their character interacts with a NPC outside the pod and attempt to lower their enuie by Discovering a new interest, or by building relationships, which can lead to a loss of cool points. <br/> <br/>I havent decided what triggers the end game yet but in the end the relationship of your points determins your characters outcome. I am also thinking about a system where you roll for a location in the airport(that you are walking by or sitting in) your scene would have to be in that area somehow. <br/><br/>Any idea how to make the characters "be" more Coupland-y I was thinking about having each character fill out a questionaire with things like "What is your vanity plate?" "What was the worst thing that happened to you in high school, and how does it haunt you" Maybe these could be turned into Key like thing. Any Ideas?                </div>
