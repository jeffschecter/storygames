When/where: NC State University, April. I've heard the dates will be the 26th and 27th, but no formal announcement has been made yet. This Game Day will be two days long, instead of the customary one-day event.<br/><br/>2. Web site: <a href="http://ncgameday.dhorizon.org" rel="nofollow">http://ncgameday.dhorizon.org</a><br/><br/>3. Forums -- A good place to post a synopsis about the event you'll be running: <a href="http://ncgameday.dhorizon.org/community/forums" rel="nofollow">http://ncgameday.dhorizon.org/community/forums</a><br/><br/>4. Prior to the event, there are usually threads at EN World and Circvs Maximus. I recommend introducing yourself and the game that you're going to be running. For example, here's the CM thread: <a href="http://www.circvsmaximvs.com/showthread.php?t=34073" rel="nofollow">http://www.circvsmaximvs.com/showthread.php?t=34073</a><br/><br/>It's a fun event. Nice accomodations, the people are friendly. At the last one, I ran two games at maximum capacity, and I sold three copies of my book. <br/><br/>Hope to see you there!<br/><br/>-- Rafael                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
