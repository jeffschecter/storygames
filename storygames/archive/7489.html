It's mostly going to be an actual play thread, despite the title, but I wanted to share a disturbing observation first. <br/><br/>I played in what was probably the last 3:16 game that John ran at GenCon (though it's quite possible he ran more on Sunday..) and before I got up from the table at sometime after midnight, I was feeling pretty nauseous. This turns into a full on stomach bug which had me throwing up by Sunday night and missing work on Monday, plus still feeling puny all day Tuesday. This by itself isn't enough. <br/><br/>I ran it again last Monday. I'll talk more about that in a moment. By the time I was running one of the players over to his barracks, and then all week until finally Friday morning I've been feeling like refried ass. Stomach ache, general body aches, fatigue, nausea.. The works, plus a couple new ones. <br/><br/>I'm planning on running it again this Monday. I'll know by Tuesday if my hypothesis is correct. <br/><br/><br/>So, on to the actual play. The game was thrown together last minute, because we're ending a D&amp;D module. We were planning to go on to a second, but with various delays (to include the aforementioned missed day of work; no gaming either that day) and others coming up, it seemed unwise to commit to a module I may not finish before my trip to the sandbox. So I woo'd them with the promise of a shoot-em-up game that could go from character creation to completed mission in 2-3 hours. When they took me up on it, I realized I hadn't actually prepared for them to say yes, so I printed character sheets (more on that at the end of the post), dug out some Pente beads to use for Threat Tokens, and drew three boxes on my battle mat and labeled 'em Close Near and Far, and settled in to play. <br/><br/>First, there was a lot of table talk... Waiting for me to get everything ready got everyone distracted, so I got their attention by standing up and shouting "Alright maggots, listen up!"<br/><br/>We went through the character creation mostly from memory, and came up with the following 3 Troopers. <br/><br/>SGT Dallas, with a reputation for being Loose Lipped.<br/>FA/NFA: 5/5<br/>Slug Rifle as his primary weapon<br/><br/>CPL Sunny, with a reputation for being Not-So-Sunny.<br/>FA/NFA: 6/4<br/>E-Cannon as his primary weapon (duh.)<br/><br/>TPR Chaz, with a reputation for being Blood Thirsty.<br/>FA/NFA: 6/4<br/>Slug Rifle as his primary weapon<br/><br/>I barely sketched in anything about the color and setting aside from reading the basic setting background, and reading them off their kits and their Orders. I didn't tell them before-hand that their rank was based off of FA and NFA, so they didn't make their choices based on rank.<br/><br/>The planet I rolled up was planet Goya, a rock so rad-hot it glowed on the night side. Their platoon was tasked with moving to and securing a location that the limited sensor scans suggested had particularly pure radioactives, so that a team of egg-heads could come down and test it to see if it was high enough quality for munitions. <br/>The aliens they would meet up with would have AA 5 (highest FA+lowest NFA)/2, 12 Threat Tokens, and were of the type Furred Creatures with the Special of Rapid Movement. <br/><br/>LT Murphy was your typical 3:16 lieutenant; No confidence in his platoon, with a particular low-grade animosity toward the PCs Squad (Bandaleros). Because I wasn't really feeling the mood, his response to interruptions was a sad attempt at a cold stare. CPL Sunny's stare was warmer, in that "I'd like to see your head in a microwave" variety of warm. For next session, I think I'm going to have him be moved to another platoon, and replace him with an idealistic young LT who got a massive field commission with very little experience, because in my experience, that sort are much more annoying. The briefing was sketchy, due to my poor plann- I mean, radioactivity on the planet interfering with detailed scans. <br/><br/>The drop-ship pilot was a direct rip-off from John's game, except less sass, and more ice-queen. SGT Dallas tried to hit on her. CPL Sunny continued to show his animosity toward officers by glaring at her until it became clear that she had no problems taking off with him standing there, not strapped in. So she drops out of the bay and hits atmo so hard that several of the NPC Troopers, and TPR Chaz all lose their lunch, then kicks them out the back without stopping, letting them hit and roll as training dictated. The NPC Squad took off immediately while SGT Dallas took stock of his men, and got a fix on their objective. <br/><br/>The first encounter was as they were en route. On the dominance roll, all three Troopers succeeded, and I failed, hence they ambushed the aliens. I described them as massive, shaggy hulks that ran on all fours. I was running low on creativity. They blew the hell out of my 6 Token encounter in short order. I think only one person took a hit. <br/><br/>Their next encounter came on the objective, where they found the other squad being surrounded by what turned out to be only 4 aliens. As they assaulted with grenades (aliens won Dominance, so set the range at close) they managed to blow themselves up pretty well, and killed off the remnants of the other squad in the process, along with 4 total aliens. No casualties, but I believe CPL Sunny may have used his armor here. <br/><br/>Continued...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166279/#Comment_166279" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T22:21:31+00:00" title="August 30, 2008 10:21PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Continued from above)<br/><br/>They secured the objective, and finally called in. The eggheads were sent down, and the squad waited. And waited. And waited... Some 40 minutes passed, and they called back in. The eggheads had broken atmo 30 minutes previously, and should have already been on-site. The ship did a scan, and managed to detect a faint SOS, and sent the squad to respond. On the way there, I described them seeing a firefight on the horizon (just color, to make it clear that they weren't the only troops on the planet) and when they arrived at the location, they found several dead aliens, and a single dead trooper. They debated carrying him with them, but decided to just mark a waypoint, and continue on. Chaz pried into the corpse's armor to lift his dog tags. <br/><br/>They arrive at the crash-site to find it being attacked by several aliens, just as it's defensive shields fail. Chaz and SGT Dallas make for the ship to use as cover and to check on the eggheads (NFA checks, I believe). CPL Sunny lays down suppressive fire, though he ends up not hitting a thing as the aliens scatter, allowing the SGT and TPR to make the ship... Then they swarm back in for a round, then move to far range, and flee. Again, grenades along with the aliens nearly manage to kill CPL Sunny. If he didn't use his armor in encounter 2, he did here. <br/><br/>Once Sunny is patched up, they take stock of the ship. They got there in time to save the eggheads and the pilot, though a panicky egghead nearly shoots Chaz as he's dragging the badly wounded CPL back in. SGT Dallas smashes him down, knocks him out cold, then radios in again. They're expecting, with the damage to the ship and all the specialized equipment, that the mission is gonna be scrubbed, and they're getting out. <br/><br/>No such luck. They're to escort the eggheads and the pilot back to the original objective so they can take samples. On the way back, they grab the corpse they'd seen before. They get to the objective, and the eggheads start their thing. The pilot (another LT) tries to start giving orders, but he's backed down by the SGT. Then the aliens attack. They keep at Far range this time, using their previously established speed to make darting attacks from all directions, while keeping the majority of their number at range. SGT Dallas tries to call E-Vac and fails while Chaz goes to town with his slug rifle. In the end, Chaz cancels once to keep CPL Sunny from dying, then uses his Strength Flashback to save them all, wiping out the remainder of the aliens in a berzerk charge with his bare hands.<br/><br/>SGT Dallas gives a "full" debrief, spinning every event to make his squad look better, and Chaz definitely comes out looking like the hero (which, by kills and final Threat Token removal, he was)<br/><br/>After the debrief and detox, the Troopers get back to their quarters. Chaz strips immediately to shower (SGTs orders: Troops before leaders), but before he can get there, there comes a tinny fanfare, and "Troopers, Post!" from a speaker in the wall, under which there is a small slot. <br/><br/>"Attention to Orders. The following personnel are awarded the Campaign Badge, First Award, for actions on the Planet Goya..." SGT Dallas dutifully takes his medals. CPL Sunny ignores his so they're dropped onto the floor. Chaz grabs his up, except for the Crimson Sword, which SGT Dallas stabs into his naked chest. Chaz takes a shower with the sword still sticking out of his pec, and we fade to black. <br/><br/>Chaz levels due to kills (28), and raises FA to a 7. <br/>SGT Dallas wins the roll, and raises FA to 6. <br/>Chaz declines to buck for rank, and all three attempt to requisition, and fail. <br/><br/>Oddly, all three choose to advance their weapons at Near range. I would have expected them to go either Close or Far, as they had very difficult times of getting into or staying at Near range for most encounters.<br/><br/>(Comments and Concerns below)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166280/#Comment_166280" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T22:21:39+00:00" title="August 30, 2008 10:21PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Comments: <br/><br/>Neil, who played CPL Sunny, had the worst dice-luck ever. He got one decent kill (17 kills) in the first encounter, and another single kill (1) with grenades in the 3rd encounter. He consistently rolled high, failing more encounters than he succeeded in, and lost both the roll-off for level advancement and for requisitioning. Twice, he had to be bailed out by his comrades to keep from dying. (once with a cancel, once with a Flashback)<br/><br/>Still, I believe even with my lackluster GMing, that everyone enjoyed the game. Everyone expressed interest in playing again, and for people mostly familiar with D&amp;D, they were definitely impressed that I was able to deliver (if only JUST) on my promise that we could go from character creation to completed mission, with no pre-generated mission, in 2-3 hours. <br/><br/>Some concerns: <br/><br/>When looking at weapons for requisition, I was reminded of something that puzzled me in John's game. The Powerblade. It's so cool thematically.. But from a tactical standpoint, there is NO reason to ever take this weapon, unless something's wrong with the book as printed. It does more damage than the other Close-range weapon, the power-claw, but the power-claw can be switched automatically. So there's a good reason to pick the Powerblade over the Power Claw. But the Powerblade does the exact same damage at close range as the Shotgun, but the Shotgun can also be fired at Near. So anyone smart would pick the shotgun over the Powerblade. If the Powerblade is able to be switched to automatically, like the other hand-to-hand weapons, then there's no reason anyone would pick the power claw. It just seems a pity, because I WANT to pick the Powerblade, but I'd be better served going with either a Powerclaw or a Shotgun. <br/><br/>The Character sheet. This is probably my own obtuseness, but I couldn't get the downloaded character sheet to print properly from the site. I wanted the nice two-per-sheet that John had at GenCon, but when I tried that, it printed it extra-small, and still only one-per-sheet. I know there's a way to do it, but I couldn't figure it out. So I made due, and recently made my own character sheet .pdf. It's a letter-sized document, with 2 of the sheet from the book on it, with one small modification: I added a box for combat drugs, so that we won't have to keep drawing it in. I'll be using it for my own group, but if Gregor doesn't mind, I'll toss up a link to it so others can use it too. <br/><br/>And that's that. I know it's lengthy, but I can't ever seem to get a decently short actual-play post without leaving out gobs of cool/useful/informative stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166283/#Comment_166283" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T23:19:41+00:00" title="August 30, 2008 11:19PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            good luck on Monday night, Wolfe.

The vehicles and the special bombs (TPK bomb, Starkiller, etc) are restricted by rank, but the weapons aren't. It's just that using a development roll to try and pick up a totally sweet weapon means you can't use a development roll to try and increase in rank, or increase one of your existing weapons' damage categories (on top of the one you get after every mission).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166406/#Comment_166406" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T01:46:05+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  1:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sidearm is restricted by rank, but it's the only one, I think.<br/><br/>This seemed odd to me at first, but then I decided that one can wear a sidearm while on the ship -- when all the other troopers are out of their armor and without their guns.

I'll be making my NFA roll to avoid becoming ill later. <br/><br/>In the spirit of wild extremes, I went from being under-prepared to possibly being over-prepared. Which I would like share with you.<br/><br/><b>The Briefing</b><br/><br/>PSG Harper: Alright Troopers, listen up! LT Murphy has left us. He was recognized for his.. administrative abilities, and will be working on the bridge of the Aspiron. In his place, we have a new lieutenant. Sir?<br/><br/>LT Young: Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am LT Young, and I have the honor to lead 3rd Platoon henceforth. Uh, there\u2019ll be relatively few changes until I get an idea of how things operate. One thing that will be changing immediately is that the platoon will be known as the Youngbloods, in the alliterative tradition of naming. Uh, so I know we don\u2019t have a lot of time, so just in brief, can each of the squad leaders stand up and introduce themselves, and what squads they lead?<br/><br/>SGT Bell: [stands up quickly, at attention] Sir, SGT Bell, 1st Squad \u201cVipers\u201d. [sits down just as quickly]<br/><br/>SGT Ortiz: [stands up lazily from his position of having his leg cocked over a nearby seat, grinning] I\u2019m SGT Ortiz, though everyone calls me \u201cBolivar\u201d. My squad\u2019s the most badass squad in the 3:16, the \u201cSkulltakers\u201d, which isn\u2019t just a nickname. Stop by the squad bay and see the collection, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. [sits back down with a self satisfied smirk]<br/><br/>SGT Dallas: \u2026 (The PC will do his own thing)<br/><br/>LT Young: Uh, right.. X Squad was wiped out on Goya, and they\u2019ve not been replaced yet. [consults his notepad] Alright. Yes. TPR Brooks, if you would please?<br/><br/>TPR Brooks: Sir. [activates the briefing screens]<br/><br/>[The screen lights up, showing a rugged landscape, all mountains with loose scrub and sere grasses. At the base of the mountains is a seething, venomous-green looking sea, whipped to a yellowy froth by the constant winds that whistle between the peaks. As the troopers watch, a creature roughly similar to a goat makes a prodigious leap from one peak to another, sailing across the impossible distance with ease.]<br/><br/>LT Young: This is the planet LG-523, named Cezanne by our reconnaissance surveyors. The atmosphere is breathable from initial samplings, but rather thin, due to the low gravity of the planet. The sea that covers the entirety of the low-ground is acidic, though it appears to be the source of most of the atmosphere. Cezanne appears to be lightly settled by a primitive race of felinoids. They are tool users, and appear to be clannish. We expect resistance will be light. The Youngbloods will be first boots on the ground in the northern hemisphere, which appears to hold the largest settlement on the planet. We\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re organized enough to consider it a capitol, but we\u2019re damned sure going to make sure that it doesn\u2019t matter before we leave. Our mission is to secure an LZ for the main body\u2019s assault, and prepare for any follow-on missions. <br/><br/>I have every confidence that the Youngbloods will be more than capable of this mission, and have assured command that they can rely on us. Now, are there any questions?<br/>[Question and answer period. SGT Ortiz may make a smart-ass macho remark during this time. SGT Bell will only clarify details]<br/><br/>Alright gentlemen. You\u2019ve got your orders. Your mission packets are under your seats, if you\u2019ve not already found them. If there aren\u2019t any last minute questions, then prepare your squads. We\u2019re to break atmo at 0730 hrs Fleet, which gives you 30 minutes to conduct PCCs/PCIs and get strapped into your drop ships. SGT Dallas, as your section\u2019s ship is going down light, TPR Brooks and I will be accompanying your squad. <br/><br/>PSG Harper: Platoon, dismissed! Get your asses suited up and locked in!<br/><br/><b>The Aliens</b><br/><br/>The aliens will be feline humanoids, slender and wiry from the light gravity. They have a caste system with a larger hunter/warrior caste. Their technology is decidedly stone-age, but with the impression that they\u2019ve gotten frighteningly good at it. The warriors are distinguishable from the others by their comparatively massive builds, and armor that looks eerily similar to MandelBrite armor cosmetically, though it\u2019s made from a surprisingly advanced technique involving layering leather strips and a high-grade, light-weight ceramic made from mud collected from the acid seas. They are head-hunters and decorate their war-icons with real skulls taken in battle. <br/><br/>At some point, the Troopers will find an area with a war-shrine decorated with human skulls that aren\u2019t exactly recent.<br/><br/>In one of the later encounters, the Troopers will come across an \u201celite\u201d force made up of warriors wearing no-shit MandelBrite armor, repaired with their own armor-making techniques, and wielding TEF-issue weaponry                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166492/#Comment_166492" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T14:14:47+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  2:14PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds great, Lance.<br/><br/>I love anything that hints that Terrans have visited a world before, or even that this Expedition is not the first one.

A chowhall scene briefly showcasing SGT Ortiz's braggartly tendencies. Then the briefing posted above. <br/><br/>Dirtside turns out to be the barely large enough peak of a mountain. NFA checks to avoid tumbling off of it when LT Miller does a combat drop, everyone succeeds. Then SGT Dallas' squad pulls out their ropes, and leaps from the edge, hoping to find an outcropping of rock about half-way down to lasso. SGT Dallas and TPR Chaz do, but TPR Chess fails her throw, and has to be rescued by SGT Dallas. They make their way to a plateau about half-way down, where they're greeted by a squad of the local felinoids. The felinoids are armed and armored for war, but they don't attack first, they wait cautiously. <br/><br/>SGT Dallas orders the attack, and the felinoids win dominance, putting them at close range. The TPRs are hard-pressed to keep at range, and once, SGT Dallas has to cancel to avoid TPR Chess being blown to smithereens by her comrades grenades. His cancel maneuver involves throwing his grenade to knock TPR Chaz's grenade wide, so that no one is hurt. First round that all three succeed, the cat people shake it off, their armor badly damaged, and keep coming. Finally they take them down. <br/><br/>LT Young joins them once the plateau is secure, and they once again repeat their maneuver to get the rest of the way down the mountain. Once more, Chess misthrows, and is rescued by SGT Dallas. They come to a chasm leading down into the acid sea that they must cross, and so SGT Dallas ties a rope around his waist, and attempts the 30ft jump, hoping the lower gravity allows him to coast across. He fails, and activates his combat drugs to give him an extra boost...<br/><br/>And dies as the drugs surge through his system, stopping his heart instantly. <br/><br/>30 minutes later, after they've hauled him back up, attempted to resuscitate him, and had a death certificate number called down from the Aspiron, he suddenly starts spasming and twitching, cursing violently and randomly. He used a Weakness flashback (my reading of the rules seemed to allow this) of when he was a teen, and recreated crystal meth from a recipe he found on the internet, and overdosed. He'll probably be dealing with the consequences of the death certificate for the next couple of sessions. <br/><br/>Once SGT Dallas had recovered, they continued on to where the rest of the platoon was being attacked on the LZ by an elite band of felinoids in real MandelBrite armor, using TEF issued weapons. After SGT Dallas' squad joined the fight, they managed to wipe them out, and then inspected their armor and weapons. LT Young called it up, and was not pleased by the response. The main body landed, and the assault of the city was on. The Youngbloods were put on point, and lead the way into the city. <br/><br/>Shortly before reaching the city, they found a felinoid war shrine, decorated with felinoid and human skulls. The human skulls were not even close to recent. SGT Ortiz was duly impressed, and they moved on, slightly disturbed. Once they reached the city, the desperate defenders attacked, and even with their armor, were quickly destroyed. <br/><br/><br/>Comments: <br/><br/>I called for a lot more NFA rolls this time, and I think both of my TPRs were feeling it, as both of them, when they leveled, raised their NFAs to 5. Under SGT Dallas' guidance, they were using the low gravity to their advantage, attempting maneuvers that they'd never have tried under normal gravity. <br/><br/>The death of SGT Dallas, and the Weakness used to "save" him from it was very cool, but questionable under the rules. It seemed it was possible, but it was an odd situation. <br/><br/>Dice luck: TPR Chess was having the hardest time proving herself with her constant NFA failures. I was tending to roll either high (failures) or very low, such that my successes tended to have little to no effect once the Troopers had had their ways with them. <br/><br/>I've got some interesting ideas for the "story" arc as we proceed. I'll have to do it much faster than I would otherwise, as I'm likely to have only 2 more sessions before I call my Ft. Riley group kaput, due to other training in the interim.<br/><br/>Oh, and John?

Any time you look at those little bastard dice -- and they've stiffed you -- then you can change what was about to happen with a Weakness or Strength.<br/><br/>I really like that he was pronounced dead, and came back to life. The Flashback to a drug-abusive past is gold. But, it was a Weakness and it still has to be a loss, though not necessarily a death -- so I'd be tempted to have him randomly drug tested by medics and so on to check he is is "clean" and only using approved medicines for some time to come. I wouldn't drop any stats or any of that -- just whatever the group thinks is fair "fall out" from surviving by using a Weakness and not a Strength. Certainly post a new (NPC) Sergeant to the group next time -- he has all the paperwork in tow as it went through as soon as Dallas' life monitor blipped out.<br/><br/>Oh, and Combat Drugs should only be allowed for FA re-rolls but the story is the ultimate goal, so it worked out better that he got his re-roll and blew it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166740/#Comment_166740" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-03T06:04:21+00:00" title="September  3, 2008  6:04AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, oops!
