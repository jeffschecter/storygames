I love that players get to contribute to world creation and it really gets them to buy into the game.<br/><br/>My question though is: is there a limit to how much input the players should have to world building? <br/><br/>Should you limit their say on the world to only stuff related to their characters or should you allow them to provide some of the history, geography and culture of the rest of the world (when required)? Could they provide maps of their own or come up with ideas for fronts and story lines? <br/><br/>Would allowing such contributions lead to disputes about 'who owns what' in the world?<br/><br/>Is there a point at which it is no longer fun for players to contribute when they realise they are losing the mystery of exploration and it all feels just made up?<br/>Or should you stick with the traditional gm approach of building and controlling the world yourself - only allowing the players to contribute when asked?<br/>I'm very interested in how other groups have handled world creation!<br/>Thanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbinc" title="jbinc"><img alt="jbinc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/106/nFRMKD4VH4ILG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbinc">jbinc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398290/#Comment_398290" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T05:26:39+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  5:26AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the sci-fi game I've been running, I've made it clear from the start that "You have final veto over your character\u2019s actions.

This level of collaboration and narrative control will vary from group to group. What works really well with 'World games is to frame everything within the reference of the Player Character, especially in terms of establishing 'world facts'. Ask pointed questions about their race, their class, their steading, their God, their food, their architecture, their enemies, their understanding of the world.<i>Always</i> address the Characters and ask <b><i>them</i></b> the provocative questions.  The disputes should be not really an issue, since nothing is 'canon' (even your prep) until authored into play. Say 'Yes and...' if you have ideas or even stakes questions of your own. Until then they are just good ideas, riff of them, make them work for the emergent fiction.<br/> <br/>So say for instance the player of Baldric the Bard mentions something about their bond with Xotoq te Dwarven Fighter during chargen and how they are writing a Ballad for them. Address Xotoq, ask him what the traditional dwarven view on Ballads? How does he feel about all the attention? And/Or Ask Baldric what was his last ballad about and why did it get him kicked out of Shambles? (a small steading already introduced earlier in Chargen and thus re-incorporated by you) So when Crookshanks the Thief mentions that he heard that the ousting of Baldric from the Thieves Guild-run town of Shambles was due to his (popular) ballad revealing snippets from a map (a map he happened to steal off Baldric - Bond); ask if Crookshanks can choose a map from a variety of one page dungeon resources or even draw one himself.<br/><br/>Just reframe your GM's view too. Its ALL made up, whether you do it beforehand as prep, or collaboratively during play. For many folks, the 'mystery' of exploration is just seeing how cool a story emerges from their shared vision of the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398303/#Comment_398303" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T07:00:51+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  7:00AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my Dungeon Worlds no one "owns" anything other than their character.

What the characters heard or believe might not be accurate - it could be rumour or conjecture.<br/><br/>For example: I asked my players what they had heard about the mysterious Gray Monks. They said "They're monkeys." I thought that was kind of silly, do I decided that the Monks actually kept monkeys as pets at the monastery, which has led to persistent rumours that the reclusive monks are themselves simian in appearance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398312/#Comment_398312" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T07:46:36+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  7:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well when i come in with my fighter who is dressed in beduine style dessert wear and swings his big Scimitar arround and sais he is the prince of the Kingdom of Shalam on a quest to find a phoenix to restore his undead father to real-live who am i to deny that? <br/>Especially in CharGen there is so much you can say about the world and make it ture - there is not really so much chance to do this later in the game.

The players have narrative authority over their dudes and the GM has it over everything else.  The GM in DW is encouraged (nay, required) to ask questions, however.  So when you don't have an idea, don't care one way or another about a thing, or just would rather let a player decide, asking questions is there.<br/><br/>A player can't just say 'Owlbears die when they see sunlight' because a) they're a player, that's not their job and b) the GM didn't ask.  Now, if they'd done something like Spout Lore about Owlbears, saying "I wrack my brain for a weakness, for something, anything O god save us from the owlbear" and rolled a 10+ the GM could just disclaim the making up of a weakness and ask "I don't know, you're the owlbear expert, boss.  You tell ME what kills 'em dead." and that's that.<br/><br/>A good GM will learn the cadence of "ask" and "declare" so as to fit his particular group best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doppelgangdave" title="doppelgangdave"><img alt="doppelgangdave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/645/n2180Q7GHK0O7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doppelgangdave">doppelgangdave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398368/#Comment_398368" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T17:32:06+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  5:32PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the help! It does seem a bit clearer to me now. Especially this:<br/><br/><i>'So when you don't have an idea, don't care one way or another about a thing, or just would rather let a player decide, asking questions is there'</i><br/><br/>I still have a couple of other questions though.<br/>Is the approach of 'ask questions, build on the answers' different from that used in Lady Blackbird where you can ask players what rumours they've heard or what they know about situation x and then incorporate that into play? As a gm in this game you seem to be riffing of most of what they say for world creation and that is much of the fun. That seems to be inviting players to contribute more to the world than just stuff to do with their character.<br/><br/>Also, if players have a say over stuff related to their character - should there be a limit to this? Eg One player has an elf as his character and so gets to say how he dresses, what he looks like, how he behaves with regard to his culture. So by extension you could go to the elf player for any further questions about elves. How much can he say about the elves' history, culture, important npcs etc before it is too much?<br/>Is there a problem if the story takes the characters to the Elven lands and you as gm start setting the scene and the Elven player says 'No!  That's not how I imagined it at all, and I should know as I am an elf!'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398372/#Comment_398372" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T18:21:31+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  6:21PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2012 6:21PM by skinnyghost.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I still have a couple of other questions though.<br/>Is the approach of 'ask questions, build on the answers' different from that used in Lady Blackbird where you can ask players what rumours they've heard or what they know about situation x and then incorporate that into play?

Whenever you want to get the players' input or honestly just don't know, go ahead and ask about the world.  Say the players ambush a slaver caravan.  You could ask "hey, was anyone here ever enslaved?  did you know anyone who was?" and someone might say "oh, my uncle was!" and you can start a quick back-and-forth about that "what are slavers in this region like?  do they have any superstitions?" which will color the next encounter.  The caravan will be, in part, dictated by the player but only in the areas where the GM asked for information.\n<blockquote>Also, if players have a say over stuff related to their character - should there be a limit to this?

You can't say "oh, actually, your eyes are sad, not wild" because that's on the sheet and part of their deal.  Most GMs will give the players a long leash regarding other stuff like history and culture, too, because it's more fun to ask the only elf in the party "why are you with these humans?!" than to just say "elves hate humans." you know?  If you've got something in mind for the world and a player asserts something different, as a GM you can say "actually, this is how that is, but..." and incorporate the players' ideas.  Basically, you want to ask questions and build on the answers as much as possible, but you're also beholden to the prep you've done, you know?  Dungeon World isn't 100% free-form "let's all just make assertions".  The narrative responsibility is pretty traditional.  Which is okay!

Last night I went through some world-building with EM and JM.  It went really well.  First we focused on populating a map together and placing the various nations and significant cities, then each girl answered background questions about their characters.  We ended up with a cool-looking map that still has lots of blank space and unnamed cities, as well as what EM describes as "classic" backstories that add a lot of oomph and depth to their characters.  If I can get their other group members to generate similar ideas, I'll have enough to throw stuff at them for <i>years</i>.<br/><br/>And yeah, according to JM, the big island chain on the map has the various islands connected by giant stone bridges that span hundreds of miles, sort of like Great Walls, except in the open ocean.  That'll be awesome to flesh out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
