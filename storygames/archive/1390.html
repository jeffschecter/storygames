                    Hey all, after going to other sites and seeing people both rally for and against decentralized play ("splitting up responsibilities"/"tyrrany of the masses" etc), I was suddenly reminded of the article way back in 2002 that I wrote for Places to Go, People to Be based off a website I saw and a conversation I had in 2001 - 5 years ago. <br/>
<br/>
This collaborative roleplay stuff was the brainchild of Ian Millington, an all around nice guy gamer at night, and by day a PhD in AI who drifted between companies of his own creation and gov't/academic thinktanks. <br/>

Here's the original interview:<br/>

I make reference to sites that no longer exist, they moved here:<br/>

The first article outlines the Collaborative Roleplaying process:<br/>

                            Nice. I pointed Emily CB at Ian Millington when she was writing her piece on collaborative play for <i>Push</i> (which is a more current update on a lot of the issues addressed in these articles).                        </div>
