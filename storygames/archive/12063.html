I felt that these concepts pretty well matched up with Conflict Resolution and Task Resolution, but provided a more clear-cut means of distinguishing between the two.  In the following discussion, however, I came to realize that the concepts do not fully match up, at least by the definitions of the terms espoused by those participating.<br/><br/>As such, I now discern that I inadvertently hijacked that thread, and for that I apologize.  However, the discussion that ensued concerning the differences between Conflict Resolution and Negotiated Contests is quite interesting to me, so I started this thread to continue the exchange.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270154/#Comment_270154" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T18:20:58+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  6:20PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>In the other thread, you said this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><br/><br/>Your "negotiated conflict" description seems confused about whether conflicts exist between characters or between players.  This is, in my opinion, an important distinction. You write:<br/><br/>One person introduces an idea that he thinks would be exciting or interesting, and if the others in the group agree to that idea, then that idea is accepted as having taken place. When one person wants to introduce something into the game world but another player wants something else, a conflict arises. The Negotiated Contest design pattern allows players to negotiate a collection of possibilities that are acceptable to all involved and then determine through some mechanical means which possibility is actually incorporated into the game world.</blockquote>\nThis is, in my opinion, not a useful description of RPG play.<br/><br/>Role playing games do have systems for resolving conflicts between players, but these systems are typically at the social contract level, or embedded in the authorities and responsibilities given to different player roles. Some games have conflict resolution systems that partially or exclusively grant authorities to players, but this isn't the basis of conflict resolution. A small number of games concern themselves entirely with apportioning responsibilities and authorities to players. Systems that do this are not the same as conflict resolution systems.<br/><br/>Conflict resolution is about conflicts between characters. It does not resolve disagreements between players over what is entered into the fiction. It determines whether characters get what they want or not.<br/><br/>I understand the difference between player and character conflicts.  I also understand that player goals and character goals do not always line up, and that this is largely why System Matters.  That is, a game system may be designed that provides players a rational reason to want something that is detrimental to their character.<br/><br/>However, fundamentally, characters are fictional constructs that only exist in the minds of the players.  The characters cannot actually "want" anything.  As such, all conflicts that truly exist are essentially differences of opinion as to what should be introduced into the fictional world.  If there is no difference of opinion, then there is no conflict that needs mechanical resolution, whether it be a character conflict or a player conflict. <br/><br/>For example, let's say the GM of a game has set up a troll guarding a bridge that a character needs to cross.  The player can say something like, "Biff the Barbarian defiantly walks past the troll."  The GM may respond with, "Okay.  As you approach, you see that the troll appears to have dozed off.  You pass without incident."  On the other hand, if the GM feels like he wants a fight, he can declare, "As you approach, the troll steps forward and swings his axe at you."  One response demonstrates no conflict exists, the other shows one does exist.<br/><br/>That's all I'm saying there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270158/#Comment_270158" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T18:50:03+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  6:50PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>In the earlier thread, you stated:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>John, here's an example of conflict resolution with mechanically pre-determined stakes:<br/><br/>D&amp;D's combat system has always been a conflict resolution system in all editions, and its stakes have always been rather predetermined. It's a conflict resolution system because it resolves contrary character intents, and it has pre-determined stakes because the system only really works when it's an issue of who takes the field, who lives, who dies - anybody who's tried using the system knows that protecting somebody, avoiding the enemy, avoiding combat, taking the opponent alive or other such secondary martial goals are really rather arbitrary and ill-defined in the system.<br/><br/>Note that individual combat rounds are commonly defined as tasks in D&amp;D; those are not conflicts. The over-all conflict is the combat in whole, and that's what is resolved by the system.<br/><br/>Also, here's an example of task resolution without mechanical pre-determination; I'll grab this from the same game just for the kicks:<br/><br/>In early versions of D&amp;D, which don't have a skill system, tasks were specifically resolved without pre-determined system and most especially without pre-determined stakes. The Mentzer D&amp;D rules suggest that the GM might want to have a player roll an ability check of their own devising (d20 under the ability score, whatever) when uncertain as to how a character fares in a general task situation. This is task resolution because it is not concerned with character intent but rather what characters do, but it does not rely on pre-determined definitions of skills or abilities or agreed-upon stakes and pacing; all those matters are resolved by the GM case-by-case.<br/></blockquote>\nThank you for those examples.  It was these that convinced me that the concepts of Conflict Resolution and Negotiated Contests don't match up.  At least, by your definition of the terms.  And, unless I hear differently from others, I'll assume that yours is a generally accepted definition, as that seems to be the consensus from those posting to the earlier thread.  To be clear about that definition, my understanding now is that any RPG whose system resolves conflicts is a Conflict Resolution system.  This includes D&amp;D, Sorcerer, Rolemaster, My Life with Master, Call of Cthulhu, RIFTS, Shadowrun, and pretty much all RPGs.  Is that correct? If not, can you please provide me with an example of an RPG that is <i>not</i> a Conflict Resolution system and explain why?<br/><br/>Assuming that definition is correct, though, I have to say that I'm even more puzzled.  I mean, Duh.  If all RPGs are conflict resolution systems, how does this knowledge help me in understanding the differences between systems, or in designing a new one that fulfills a particular game vision?  I'm not trying to be snotty here.  I know a lot of very smart people think this is important.  So, I'm obviously missing something.  Is it just that it is possible to design a Conflict Resolution system that doesn't involve Task Resolution or is it something more?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270159/#Comment_270159" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T18:54:14+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  6:54PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2010 6:58PM by Jesse.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>I like games where the rule is that if there is an identifiable conflict between characters then use the system to see what happens.  Here's why that's different than just a difference opinion.<br/><br/>Player: "I shoot NPC Joe."<br/>GM: "Yeah, NPC Joe is an asshole.  I hope you kick his ass.  But NPC Joe is going to try to save his ass and that's a conflict so we need to roll."<br/><br/>You see what's happening here?  Both the GM and the Player are hoping the Player's character kick's Joe's ass.  There's no difference in Player-to-Player opinion.  But because a conflict exists within the fiction (because the GM is honest with himself about the conceptual integrity of NPC Joe) the rules dictate that it must be resolved via the system.<br/><br/>Obviously the two humans can just ignore that and go with what they "want" but at that point they'd be ignoring the rules of the game.<br/><br/>I like this approach because it takes people out of their comfort zones.  I really love Vincent's quote about rules that produce unwanted and unwelcome results but are so compelling we accept them anyway.<br/><br/>So the Player and the GM are both hoping the player kick's NPC Joe's ass.  But then he doesn't.  NPC Joe totally wins.  Now both player's are upset and worked up and "Oh my god!  I can't believe that asshole got away with it!  Fuck, what's going to happen NOW?!"<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>P.S.

If you say, "Ninjas come through the window" and I say, "No!  Zombies come through the doors."   Then we, in the real world, are in conflict because we are each asserting that our idea is *better* than the others.  You want Ninjas.  I want Zombies.  One of us has to be denied what we *want*.<br/><br/>When players are tasked with "speaking" for a given fictional entity then they simply have to say what they think the entity does during the given circumstances.  If you say, "Joe shoots Bob" and I say "Bob hits Joe with a baseball bat."  I'm not saying "I think it's better if Bob hit's Joe with baseball bat rather than Joe shooting Bob."  I'm simply stating what I think Bob does in reaction to being shot at by Joe.<br/><br/>What I or you *want* doesn't matter.  We're not trying to "get things" out of the fiction.  We're just playing the character with creative passion and gusto and seeing what happens together.<br/><br/>I think most problems arise in RPGs when player's try to wrestle and shape the fiction as a whole to conform to something they want rather than just playing the character and willing to let the fiction take form on its own.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270166/#Comment_270166" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T20:06:23+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  8:06PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Jesse.

I actually don't have any strong opinion on the matter of whether all conflicts can be boiled down to differences of opinion between players.  I don't think that the Negotiated or Generalized Contest design patterns hinge on that issue, anyway.  I will consider re-wording the text.  (Or, heck, it's a wiki now, so you could re-word it yourselves :-)<br/><br/>What concerns me at the moment is why I should care about the concept of Conflict Resolution at all, as distinct from Task Resolution.  If all RPG systems are Conflict Resolution systems, then what is all of this discussion about Conflict vs. Task resolution telling me about how to design games?  If all it is saying is that it is <i>possible</i> to design a Conflict Resolution system without Task Resolution, then that seems to me to be patently obvious (as a trivial case: Flip a coin.  If it's heads, you get what you want.  If it's tails, I get what I want.)  However, it doesn't tell me anything about why I would want to do that, or how to approach designing a specific system to achieve my game vision.  Heck, my understanding now is that a single instance of Task Resolution can also be an example of Conflict Resolution, as long as the results of the task actually fulfill a character desire.  For example, a single shot from my character's gun that kills his wife's rapist.  <br/><br/>Furthermore, I still don't know that I can distinguish between Task Resolution and Conflict Resolution. Suppose I have a Jedi Knight character who is having a light-sabre battle with a Clone Warrior and I kill him after a few swipes of my weapon.  My understanding is that each swing of the light-saber is a task, and killing the Clone Warrior is an instance of Conflict Resolution.  However, if that same Clone Warrior were to have been accompanied by three others, then the killing of the first clone doesn't end the battle, the conflict is not yet completely resolved, and therefore killing him was merely a task on the way to final victory.  You could say that killing each clone is itself an instance of lower-level Conflict Resolution that feeds into the higher-level Conflict Resolution of winning the battle.  But then, why isn't a single instance of a light-sabre swing also an instance of Conflict Resolution?  It seems that, at each level, I can answer the question "Why am I doing this?" and come up with a reasonable answer.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just trying to extract too much out of all this, but it just seems like much ado about nothing if there isn't any more substance to Conflict Resolution than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270182/#Comment_270182" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T03:03:14+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  3:03AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't the difference between Task and Conflict resolution just the number of fictional characters involved?

Task resolution sees the player rolling to determine the outcome of his character's specific in-fiction action (hit an enemy, climb a wall, persuade this-or-that NPC, etc) whereas Conflict resolution is the player rolling to determine the outcome of the situation in which is character is involved, often taking into account the character's over-arching motivation within said scene (win a fight, access the fortress, gain this-or-that piece of information). <br/><br/>Personally, I find it easier to think of it in terms of 'action resolution' and 'situation resolution,' if that's any help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270191/#Comment_270191" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T04:52:02+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  4:52AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, some more about the difference between task and conflict resolution. I see that Jesse already explained well how conflict resolution in most games is not about differences the <i>players</i> have as regards the fiction; the great majority of successful designs presumes that the players actually agree on the fundamental direction of play, and conflict resolution is only there to provide excitement and interesting creative constraint and interactivity. The characters fight for the amusement of the players, essentially.<br/><br/>As for how conflict and task resolution differ, I can only offer the definitions: task resolution is when the imaginary character is trying to do something and we want to find out whether he succeeds. Conflict resolution is when imaginary characters have a conflict of interest and we want to see who gets their way. Note that these two are not in any way exclusive towards each other; they're different categories of consideration. It is entirely possible for the same situation and game mechanic to resolve both a task and a conflict at the same time if the players have arranged for the task and conflict to coincide; many think that the only effective and fun way of using a task resolution system is to use it like this, by ensuring that the tasks resolved correspond to conflicts.<br/><br/>From the above viewpoint it's not exact to say that all roleplaying games have a conflict resolution system. To pick a game you mentioned, John, one that I know well: <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> does not, strictly speaking, have a conflict resolution system ingrained in the game text. The text advices the GM to introduce task resolution as appropriate, but there is no verbiage that would ensure for the task resolution to correspond with conflicts in any way. In fact, the game is notorious for how much task resolution its methodology engages in without any particular conflict guaranteed to be involved. Of course the same exact mechanics can be engaged with conflict resolution methodology; the simplest way is for the GM to ask the players what their characters want, after which he frames reasonable situations and conditions that allow the characters to try to accomplish their intents, after which one or more skill checks are made to find out whether they succeed - that's conflict resolution, because the GM has committed to resolving the character intents; it's also task resolution, as the CoC rules-set only provides task resolution and Luck rolls that might be used in resolving things.<br/><br/>If we want to talk about game texts and which "have" a conflict or task resolution system, I think that it's pretty important to only consider a game text as possessing a conflict resolution system if the text actually discusses character intents, stakes-setting or whatever and then provides concrete mechanics or methodology for how to do this. All games resolve conflicts, but that is not the same as all games having a conflict resolution system. The great majority of games can be used very effectively to resolve conflicts if you know what to bring into the game yourself from outside the text in terms of GM skill or such, but that's not the same as the game text itself having a conflict resolution system.<br/><br/>I should note that if a random passer-by reads the above from the viewpoint of thinking that I'm sermonizing for the absolute supremacy of conflict resolution vs. task resolution, it's going to seem strange. After all, why would character intentions be that central in comparison to what characters factually do? The real truth is that they're not - a robust conflict resolution is not an universal roleplaying tonic that everybody needs to swallow for their play to work. There are plenty of rpg design paradigms in which the conflict resolution can be arbitrary or invisible. It's just the dramatic, player-coordinating style of game that's so common at the Forge that needs robust conflict-resolution: because drama arises from protagonists in struggle, we need to know what those protagonists want and whether they succeed in their struggles. For this sort of game how you do conflict resolution is very important. For a different sort of game, such as Call of Cthulhu, it's not nearly so much: the GM can resolve conflicts by fiat, essentially, as long as the players get the chance to experience the events and direct the order and pacing of their development by having their character move to different places and initiate different proceedings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270194/#Comment_270194" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T05:21:00+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  5:21AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>As for how conflict and task resolution differ, I can only offer the definitions: task resolution is when the imaginary character is trying to do something and we want to find out whether he succeeds.

The key part is that there is a dramatic actor (a character for whom we posit an inner existence, to be exact) with an intent acting in a scene. You might think of conflicts as "task + motivation" in this regard - conflict only exists if we have a character the audience can sympathize with struggling to achieve something; indeed, some would say that we have a conflict even without the overt struggle, and that's certainly true of certain genres. The reason for why this is often depicted in an opposed manner is that most conflicts in fiction tend to involve several characters. Strictly speaking, however, something like whether Odysseus ever gets home might be a conflict "against nature", making for a one-sided conflict. (And yes, I would make that "Odysseus vs. the gods" in practice, too. Just an example.)<br/><br/>Consider: when a character is hitting another with a sword, that is always a task to be resolved - some games might allow a player to just describe the task any which way, but that's still resolution. The mere fact that there is another character there does not make this conflict resolution. However, if we also presuppose a character intent (perhaps to kill the other guy?) and decide that the intent will be effectively resolved by this sword-swing, then that very same act transforms into conflict resolution as well. Or, as D&amp;D has it, we have the overarching intent of killing the other guy, and this conflict is resolved by a series of tasks: hit successfully so many times that the other guy loses his hit points, and you get what you want. In this D&amp;D example the "task resolution system" is to roll a to-hit roll to see if the task was successful, while the "conflict resolution system" is that you kill the other character not arbitrarily, but by reducing him to zero hit points, which is usually done by hitting successfully.<br/><br/>I should note that this basic theoretical definition does not really comment upon the common virtues of robust conflict resolution systems simply because it's theoretical. When we get to practical application, the conflict system will look somewhat different because the given game allows and disallows different types of conflict, and handles them differently. For example, Primetime Adventures makes it seem like conflicts are about scene-resolution and static character issues because that's the way the game in question narrows and utilizes the general concept. The example of PTA does not mean that all conflicts everywhere are like they are in PTA, it just means that PTA transforms all conflicts into the sort it handles to structuralize the game in the way it does. Stakes technique is another example, people mix up the general concept of "conflict resolution" with the specific concept of "determining stakes and resolving them". The more general conflict resolution thing is something that happens in practically all games somehow; some games have a conflict resolution <i>system</i>, making the resolution explicit and systematic; some games use a specific stakes-setting method of conflict resolution, which is just an arbitrary technique among others for handling and resolving conflicts. Taking the part for the whole of the concept tends to make this thing more difficult to think about than it has to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270196/#Comment_270196" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T05:55:00+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  5:55AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, also, your example, Mike: rolling to escape prison is almost always a conflict, it seems to me; I can't conceive of the practical game where we would roll for a character to escape a prison and it wouldn't be a conflict in the theoretical sense. This is because I'm having difficulty imagining how the character would escape without this being a matter of intent for him.<br/><br/>Some games will resolve this prison-escape thing by querying the fiction and breaking the conflict down into a series of tasks. For example, <i>Solar System</i> would have the players pick some appropriate abilities, describe how they pertain to the situation, and then make rolls to find out how the character sneaks, lies, bribes his way out. Succeed in the tasks, and the system guarantees that you also succeed in the conflict.<br/><br/>Other games will leave the conflict resolution up to the GM: his job is to introduce adversity into the situation and resolve it in a way that allows the character to escape from the prison at the end of the session, fulfilling the pre-sketched dramatic arc. In this case individual task resolution cycles do not directly impinge on the overall conflict of escape, really, except insofar as they inform the narration of the details.<br/><br/>Yet other games will allow you to resolve the prison escape conflict without querying either the GM or a task resolution system. <i>Polaris</i>, for example, doesn't have a mechanized task resolution system at all; all conflicts in it are overcome by the character when and if the Heart player succeeds in accomodating the antagonistic pressures of the Mistaken. It's also interesting in that the game's conflict resolution system is a really, really generic one: the only real conflict in that game is the one the Heart has with the Mistaken, and individual resolution cycles are just way-points in that. Something like a prison break will be resolved in that system as a minor sidepoint of a much larger story.<br/><br/>Just some examples of how conflicts can be resolved. The concept of conflict itself is simple, but there are so many ways of handling conflicts as they arise in the fiction that we haven't even nearly tapped them all as of yet. For instance, I've been exploring delayed resolution myself lately: I'm pretty convinced that certain genres of fiction rely on indefinitely delayed conflict resolution, so that's something I want to put into a game in a consistent way as well. Sort of like <i>Dust Devils</i> allows you to put down the conflict and come back to it later, except enforced by the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270200/#Comment_270200" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T06:17:10+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  6:17AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2010 7:16AM by Todd_L.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conflict resolution was, at its inception, an intriguing proposition.<br/><br/>I have always disliked the counter-proposition that <br/>'nearly everything we once thought was task resolution was actually conflict res after-all'.<br/><br/>Granted, the counter-proposition is true, Reductio Ad Absurdum.<br/><br/>And yet, although you =can= disprove an entire proposition by focusing on its most absurd extreme cases--<br/><br/>don't be sure that something of value won't also be discarded in the process.<br/><br/>That's why I am sad to see the counter-proposition having now become the conventional wisdom.<br/><br/>Conflict resolution WAS an intriguing concept, back when it implied something new beyond "D&amp;D".<br/>But as soon as "D&amp;D is conflict res, too"-- the definition expanded too far to be innovative.<br/><br/>For that reason, I am glad that Negotiated Contests have been defined.<br/>Negotiated Contests may not equate-to 'what Conflict Res means' now.  <br/>But Negotiated Contests are closer to the spirit of 'what conflict res meant, back when it Meant Something'.<br/><br/><br/>Likewise,the idea that 'there's no real difference between tasks and conflicts' also bothered me as absurd:<br/><br/>Maybe strictly 'true', but still absurd.<br/><br/>"What's your motivation?"

Have you considered, though, that the innovative part might still be there even if we're strictly logical about the application of the terminology?<br/><br/>I'm well aware of how people <i>want</i> to use the term "conflict resolution" for the exciting new ways of resolving conflicts while minimizing the fact that the same theoretical functions have actually been accomplished by different means in games all along. Then you can say that D&amp;D "doesn't have conflict resolution", and that's a firm, concrete reason for why the game's not working for you. That is certainly useful.<br/><br/>However, I personally prefer to be exact in my terminology. I have no difficulty in accepting that "conflict resolution" is not a very special term by itself, but rather simply means that conflicts get resolved, just like natural language works. If I want to speak specifically of the modern, advanced techniques of conflict resolution that make recent game design exciting, I can easily speak of "explicit conflict resolution procedures" or "explicit stakes" or "mechanically regulated universal conflict resolution" or "formally paced conflict resolution mechanics" or "limited GM powers over conflict resolution procedures" or any number of other individual things that are concretely attempted by specific games. I don't see the value of mixing these details up in the very general and simple concept of conflict resolution by itself. That seems to only end up in stupid debates over whether conflict resolution is any different from task resolution or how come this game you claim to be task resolving actually does the same exact thing that other game does. Vague buzz-words give good sound-bite, but they're not going to convince anybody of the logical efficacy of your theory work.<br/><br/>Excitement is all well and good, and I don't begrudge the use of a short-hand when the participants in a discussion know what they're talking about. I myself often say things like "this game doesn't have conflict resolution, which seems a shame when it's otherwise rather modern" and do not actually mean that in any exact theoretical sense: I'm just saying that this game doesn't have <i>explicit textual procedures</i> for conflict resolution - it's just shorter and simpler to say "no conflict resolution" than "no explicit textual procedure for how conflicts get resolved, so I guess we'll have to default to traditional GM fiat on this one".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270206/#Comment_270206" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T07:03:28+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  7:03AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me conflict resolution clarified some of the problems I was having with a lot of games and the playstyles I'd been involved with at the time.  Looking back to Gurps and Call of Cthulhu and even D&amp;D; 3rd or for awhile I looked at some free stuff like Fuzion they all had skill systems and the big debate was on how to set target numbers.  Play revolved around players deciding their character wanted to try something, the gm would call for the appropriate skill roll, determine success or failure and then he would judge whether the attempted use of the skill was relevant or not.  i.e. you succeed at your search roll on the chest but there was nothing there to find move on to searching the next location and start all over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict resolution cuts that short and makes us think of the dramatic consequences.  You dont roll to search a chest you roll to see if you can find the information without leaving signs you broke in or that you do it before the guards show up.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; combat is a bit tricky because it may or may not resolve a conflict.

Especially D&amp;D combat: I've been strutting it as an example here because I feel that it makes a good counter-example for the whole notion that there is no conflict resolution prior to year 2002, but of course the D&amp;D combat is not an universal conflict resolution system; it's just the one conflict it resolves well, and that is who lives and who dies. You can hack the time-limit on the princess thing by declaring in advance that "after three combat rounds the princess dies", but even as that is actually conflict resolution, it also shows how rather sucky D&amp;D is in resolving that sort of conflict: players can't really influence how many rounds a combat takes in many situations, and non-combat actions in combat have always been rather ill-defined, so bye bye princess. A good example of how you can have conflict resolution that is still sucky design, in fact; mere explicit conflict resolution is no guarantee of quality.<br/><br/>John: that's pretty close, it seems to me. I'd like to nitpick that the "opposition" in task resolution might just be the inherent fictional difficulty of the task itself - picking a lock is task resolution "against the lock" or "against the inherent difficulty of handling lockpicking tools correctly" or whatever. But that's basically correct.<br/><br/>For the conflict resolution definition, I'd like to nitpick the part about character actions: what you describe is correct for any conflict resolution system that resolves conflicts via task resolution, but there are plenty of games where the two are not attached. It is entirely possible to have a system where the conflict is resolved first with no reference to any particular tasks, and then the conflict resolution is narrated into the fiction with arbitrary task resolutions on the way. <i>Dust Devils</i> works like this, to pick a classic example.<br/><br/>Thus, to rephrase for accuracy:<br/><br/>Explicit conflict resolution system is when a character strives to overcome a problem, and this is handled by rules that determine whether the character succeeds in achieving his intent or not.<br/><br/>That's not as concrete as your description, but that's because I wanted to be exact on the borderline cases: some games don't have mechanics for conflict resolution but still resolve conflicts, others don't require all players to understand the presence of the conflict, yet others don't associate tasks with conflicts... all sorts of borderline cases that have to be accounted for in pure theory. If we were talking of the mainstream of rpg design, though, then your definition would be clearly sufficient.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270221/#Comment_270221" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T08:19:53+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  8:19AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2010 9:57AM by Todd_L.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I can easily speak of "explicit conflict resolution procedures" or "explicit stakes" or "mechanically regulated universal conflict resolution" or "formally paced conflict resolution mechanics" or "limited GM powers over conflict resolution procedures" or any number of other individual things that are concretely attempted by specific games. </blockquote>\nThat's an elegant sentence.

It's true that the way terminology is used evolves. The way I see it from the inside of the discourse is that our understanding of the matters themselves evolves, and that informs the way we use the terminology. For instance, "conflict resolution" has indeed been used as an opposite of "task resolution", and I fully understand why this has been so: when you only have examples of "implicit conflict resolution with explicit task resolution" and "explicit conflict resolution with implicit task resolution" to compare with each other, it makes sense to use those two primary terms to describe these specific system set-ups. It's simple and to the point. However, as our understanding of the entire field grows, we see that what we called "conflict resolution" is actually just one arbitrary form of a much larger phenomenon - well, the name fits that larger thing much better, so it's pretty natural to start using it that way.<br/><br/>I'd compare this to how some secluded village is used to calling the animals they have "cows". Then industrialization comes and they bring in new sorts of cows from the larger world, ones that have been adapted to milking much better than their own country breed. So now they start calling those new things "cows" as well, but that's confusing, so they add qualifiers: one type of cow becomes "traditional cow", while the other is the "new cow", or whatever. Perhaps place names: "Jutland cow" or whatnot. The point is, the word "cow" has shifted from signifying a part to signifying a whole, which is a pretty natural development in how language is used. I personally believe that if we still used "conflict resolution" to mean exclusively "explicit stakes-setting with narration sharing and without explicit task resolution the way Dust Devils does it", the terminology would be much more confusing. I can't even begin to guess what term we would use for the larger general idea of resolving conflicts in general, without using stakes or narration-sharing.<br/><br/>As Vernon describes it, "conflict resolution" is a good term for resolving conflicts because it's transparent and to the point: we understand what a "conflict" is in theory terms (that term has remained unchanged since Sorcerer in much of Forge parlance, despite some confusion a few years ago when some folks appropriated the term for inter-player disagreements), and we understand what "resolution" means as a natural word. This is one particular bit of jargon I'm rather happy with. The same goes for much of the GNS theory for me - the shifts in usage I see are mostly refinements, as we learn to better analyze phenomena and thus find that hey, these two bits go together or hey, actually this one bit is in truth two separate bits. So the usage of terminology changes, but the change is not arbitrary, but consistent and logical for the most part.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I should note that staring at mere terminology instead of the ideas themselves is a very confusing way of following the rpg theory discussions. Everybody tends to have slightly different meanings for the words they use, especially if they do active theory work! This is simply because of the sort of terminological development I describe above as regards "conflict resolution" - our understanding of the things we discuss evolves, and thus we reapply the terminology to better fit the situation. For example, I wouldn't swear that Ron Edwards would underwrite the way I describe conflict resolution vs. task resolution as terms, but I'm pretty sure that he would agree with me on the actual substance behind the words. Usually we don't have any significant difficulty in understanding what others mean when they talk about these things when we're immersed in the stuff ourselves, simply because we can quickly match the terms others use to the actual ideas behind the terminology. If you don't know the ideas yet, it becomes much more difficult to reconcile different ways of saying the same thing.<br/><br/>This also gives rise to the frequent outsider perception that theoretical terminology is arbitrary and everybody disagrees about what the words mean. GNS for instance - I know perhaps a dozen people whose understanding of that terminology and theoretical model accords with my own (there are probably more out there, I just couldn't name them right off), while practically everybody else utilizing those terms seems to do it without really understanding the theory. This isn't that confusing from inside the discourse because I know what I know, and I can easily ignore mis-applied terminology or just ask a person to speak in plain language. However, looking at the topic from outside the discourse, it's obviously going to be hella confusing when you don't know whose explanations to believe and why these two people in these two separate discussions use the same words in entirely different ways. With inside knowledge you can just categorize superficial differences according to whether they matter, whether some usage is outdated or whatever. From the outside it's all just a big mess.<br/><br/>Ultimately, insofar as I'm allowed to get philosophical about the entire prospect of rpg theory here, I have to say that all this theory discourse would probably be easier if it wasn't conducted in public fora among a shifting set of participants. That's an unique environment for discussion, resembling public political discourse more than quiet academics in many ways. Everybody has an opinion and there are no credentials or chronological development in any of it. Terminology is appropriated and mutated arbitrarily because "that's how I understand the word". It's just ships passing in the night, excepting some core circles among which the same people engage in continuous dialogue with each other, often privately. Considering how rpg theory isn't really that immediately useful for gamers (or shouldn't be as the game texts improve and you no longer need the equivalent of a Master's degree to play successfully), all this could probably be arrayed in smarter ways, too. The average hobbyist reads all about this GNS stuff or whatever and then understandably gets uncertain and apprehensive: should I know this stuff to improve my play? Should I have an opinion on this matter to fit into a community? Should I learn to do this conflict resolution thing so I can be a real boy? Can I go to the movies and enjoy the film without reading <i>The Art of Dramatic Writing</i>? Then knowledge is looked for in all sorts of places, all mired up in wacky Internet identity politics that dictate who you can and can't ask - sometimes it seems that nine in ten rpg discussion participants would rather invent their own meanings for the word "narrativism" than go ask Ron, who is consistently available in the Internet, what he means by the word. And then it's some surprise when nobody seems to agree about the term. All that much bull-shit from the viewpoint of actual play.<br/><br/>(Like Tod, I probably sound more agitated above than I'm feeling. Imagine a sardonic tone here, if you please.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270247/#Comment_270247" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T10:35:58+00:00" title="May  6, 2010 10:35AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            interesting discussion, despite the difficulties and confusion. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>For my own understanding, I just like to think of conflict resolution as mechanics that resolve character conflicts of interest <i>reliably</i>.

I agree that the opposition in Task Resolution could be a lock that needs to be opened.  That is why I worded it in a way that does not specify exactly what kinds of opposition can present themselves.  However, based on my current understanding, Eero, I'm thinking your improved definition of Conflict Resolution actually has flaws, or is incomplete.  To repeat:\n<blockquote><br/><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>Explicit conflict resolution system is when a character strives to overcome a problem, and this is handled by rules that determine whether the character succeeds in achieving his intent or not.<br/></blockquote>\nMy own nitpick, and please correct me if I'm wrong in my understanding, is that Conflict Resolution actually <i>requires</i> that all players participating in a conflict actually know the intent of the characters involved in the conflict, and that they agree that the resolution of the conflict will help the winning character attain his aims as understood by those involved.  So,would this definition fix the problems you had with my previous wording?<br/><br/><b>Conflict Resolution is when a character participates in a conflict of any kind that needs mechanical resolution, where all players involved in the conflict understand what the character is trying to accomplish by his actions, and where all players agree that his actions will move the winning character closer toward his goal in a way that is understood by all involved. </b><br/><br/>If I can get a "thumbs up" on this definition, then I will post some examples of extreme and/or unusual cases to make sure the definitions stand up to scrutiny, or whether they need to be further modified.  (BTW, I am now seeing how a definition like this one can help in game design, for those who think I am insufferably thick-headed.)  ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270325/#Comment_270325" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T00:42:04+00:00" title="May  7, 2010 12:42AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Here are a couple of concepts that might help you:<br/><br/><b>Explicit vs. Implicit</b><br/><br/>I think what you're describing is explicit Conflict resolution, but not all conflict resolution is explicit. One of the most common kinds of conflict resolution is "the GM decides whether the character gets what they want", which is implicit resolution. In other words, we have a system for deciding whether characters get what they want, but that system is not described in the rules text or even discussed out loud. It's just how things are done.<br/><br/>One of the points of confusion regarding conflict resolution (and Eero discusses this above) is that people want to use the term conflict resolution to mean only the kind of explicit conflict resolution (where we have a system for deciding if characters get what they want, and that system is written down in the rules text) that's found in some indie games. That's understandable, but it makes the definition of conflict resolution a nonsense.<br/><br/>All games where characters get things they want have conflict resolution.<br/><br/><b>Ad-hoc vs. Principled</b><br/><br/>Ad-hoc resolution is where the resolution is made on the basis of changing, arbitrary, or unclear methods. "GM decides" can be ad-hoc, if the GM isn't clear or is arbitrary in their decision making, but it can also be principled if the GM has clearly stated criteria for making decisions. Dice-based resolution can still be ad-hoc, if the decision about when to employ or how to interpret the dice is arbitrary or unclear.<br/><br/>In practice, I think most GMs are making principled decisions in "GM decides" games, though often their principles are obscure to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270326/#Comment_270326" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T04:49:44+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  4:49AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon's got good stuff. I usually use "explicit" vs. "implicit" to mean whether the game text directly addresses the issue and gives firm directives on how to deal with it. So "explicit conflict resolution" wouldn't necessarily involve all players, but it would use firm, self-aware methods instead of the implicit GM-skill-based ways common to traditional design. Ad-hoc vs. principled is a good way of capturing this same thing to be sure - although I'm not so sure if most GMs are principled; in my experience the trad GM will at least change his principles from campaign to campaign if not from session to session, as his understanding of play and the skills involved evolves.<br/><br/>As for whether all players know about the character's intent, that seems pretty arbitrary to me. Why would that be important? I mean, I know why it might be important for an individual game design - a game might require everybody to know why a character struggles to induce sympathy for a protagonist, for example, in a typical narrativist game, but for roleplaying in general I could well imagine that not everybody would know the intent. In fact, I've written explicit crunch for Solar System some time that hides the intent: you get to participate in a conflict without telling the other players what your character is even trying to do. Definitely a specialist application for that game, and one I mostly wrote up for fun and kicks, but I'm sure that there are games where hiding the intent actually serves some useful purpose. At least adversial games like Amber or such - in those players want to hide the character intents from each other even as conflicts get resolved. (Amber incidentally has a relatively robust conflict resolution system I understand from playing it - haven't read the game text, though.)<br/><br/>In fact, consider In A Wicked Age. It has an effective, explicit, mechanical and principled conflict resolution system which does not require character intents to be known. We know that it is a conflict resolution system because conflicts in fact get resolved by applying it; this is not under dispute. We also know that it does not require character intents to be known, by considering its methodology: the game requires players to state what their characters do and launches into the conflict resolution only once concrete actions become unconscionable for other characters. Is there a statement of intent in there? I don't remember so, although the choice of stats surely does give dramatic indication of the spirit in which the character acts. Only once the negotiation phase starts will the players likely come out with what their character really wants, and even then that's not a given - the loser might never voice out what their character wanted, because that's not needed in the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270341/#Comment_270341" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T07:45:47+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  7:45AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that example, Eero.  Unfortunately, I think I'm back to not understanding something.  Surely, at some point, the winning character's intent has to be stated to ensure that the character actually attains what he wants.  Otherwise, how do you know?  I see by your example of In A Wicked Age, though, that the intent may not have to be described before the conflict is resolved, and, as you said, it may be irrelevant what the loser wanted (I haven't played or read In A Wicked Age, unfortunately).  Perhaps this would be better:<br/><br/><b>Conflict Resolution is when a character participates in a conflict of any kind that needs mechanical resolution, where the players involved in the conflict understand at some point what the winning character is trying to achieve by his actions, and where all players agree that the actions of the winning character will actually attain what he was striving to achieve.</b><br/><br/>Also, while I understand that it is good to have Explicit rules governing Conflict Resolution in a game's text, it seems to me that the actual concept is independent of whether it is Explicit or Implicit.  I can see how it matters whether it is Ad-Hoc or Principled, however, as an Ad-Hoc methodology is obviously not going to satisfy all the conditions necessary for character intent all the time.  Obviously, in game design you want Explicit Principled rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270345/#Comment_270345" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T08:18:39+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  8:18AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About your phrasing, by the way: if you have no problem with the concept of conflict, why can't you define conflict resolution simply as "conflict resolution is when a conflict pertaining to a character in the game is resolved"? Just a thought, considering that that's the core idea we're trying to reach.<br/><br/>About stating the winning character's intent: well, that's a question for game design, isn't it? I see no logical necessity for intents to ever be explicitly stated for conflict resolution to occur. There are wide swatches of roleplaying culture where stating intent explicitly is actually considered bad play and metagaming. Nordic immersionism, for instance, holds that the ideal conflict resolution happens through unspoken, mutually understood push and pull where the players generate fictional color and analyze it, ultimately coming to a compromise that satisfied the vision of both parties. Conflicts in this style of play may not be differentiated from the rest of the texture of play in any way, and you certainly can't stop and explify what your character wants, unless you do it through your character in the fiction doing exactly that.<br/><br/>Furthermore, that definition of yours is still unnecessarily attached to character actions. There is no such attachment in drama in general, nor in roleplaying games. For example, consider this: the scene opens with an innocent maiden being threatened by a monster. The monster approaches, intent on defiling the maiden in ways worse than death. In its bestial intent the monster knocks down a vase that comes crashing down, scattering a flower arrangement every which way. Awakened from its reverie, the monster looks around guiltily and then retreats into the shadows, only moment before the caring yet impotent father comes to the room with his lamp, worried about the noise.<br/><br/>The question is, was what I depicted above a conflict? Were character intents involved? What did characters do, and how did those acts resolve a conflict? The above sort of thing is bog-common in dramatic literature, so much so that I doubt that anybody would have failed to see something of the sort at some time. I would also like to suggest that the above was very clearly a scene of conflict: innocence vs. bestiality, propriety vs. immediate gratification, whatever. Even clumsiness vs. interior decoration if you wanted to get banal about it. Did the innocent maiden do something to win the conflict? Did the monster do something to lose it? Did the maiden remain unmolested due to the monster's morality reasserting itself, or was the monster afraid of being revealed?<br/><br/>As a practical game example, I would like to point to <i>My Life with Master</i>: conflicts in that game are not resolved via task resolution, but rather it is rather obvious and clear that the resolution mostly resembles my gothic scene above: certain character sentiments and arching themes are numerized and compared to arrive to a conclusion as to the appropriate direction of the scene. If a particular task can be recognized as the crucial turning point of the scene, perhaps that task's success will be directly determined by the conflict resolution outcome, but that's going to be arbitrary: the scene might just as well involve the character missing his opening altogether and never doing anything at all, failing or succeeding out of dumb fate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270382/#Comment_270382" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T13:10:12+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  1:10PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2010 1:12PM by Todd_L.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Nordic immersionism, for instance, holds that the ideal conflict resolution happens through unspoken, mutually understood push and pull where the players generate fictional color and...</blockquote>\nAre those tabletop games?<br/><br/><br/>(I'm not disputing your larger point.

One of the big developments of this decade in the form has been Jeepform, which is largely a form of blurring the lines and combining larp-like and tabletop-like features together. I think that the fluid continuum is even pretty successful now and then today, at least looking at it from the outside; today it seems that you can do Nordic freeform immersionism on tabletop, Jeep, as a larp, all nearly interchangeably.<br/><br/>For this specific detail I'd say that insofar as I understand it, the conflict resolution ideal I described holds for both larp and tabletop. In tabletop play GM authoritarianism (having the GM decide and narrate conflict resolution) is another popular method, of course, but I've seen the larp-like negotiated resolution often enough to know that it's not marginal by any means. I mostly encounter these techniques when I try to play some game with explicitly mechanized conflict resolution with players who've learned to handle conflicts in a freeform environment; I usually have to teach them very deliberately to advocate for their characters instead of seeking to avoid conflict or compromise for the good of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270432/#Comment_270432" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T08:27:09+00:00" title="May  8, 2010  8:27AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>About your phrasing, by the way: if you have no problem with the concept of conflict, why can't you define conflict resolution simply as "conflict resolution is when a conflict pertaining to a character in the game is resolved"?

I am honestly here trying to learn.<br/><br/>However, as I stated earlier, such a definition is so broad that it covers all conflicts in all role-playing games.  It also tells me nothing about how to design a game to attain my design goals.  In fact, I think I would have to re-wind this thread back up to post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> where I said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Kirk</cite>To be clear about that definition, my understanding now is that any RPG whose system resolves conflicts is a Conflict Resolution system. This includes D&amp;D, Sorcerer, Rolemaster, My Life with Master, Call of Cthulhu, RIFTS, Shadowrun, and pretty much all RPGs. Is that correct? If not, can you please provide me with an example of an RPG that is not a Conflict Resolution system and explain why?</blockquote>\nTo this, you responded with:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>From the above viewpoint it's not exact to say that all roleplaying games have a conflict resolution system. To pick a game you mentioned, John, one that I know well: Call of Cthulhu does not, strictly speaking, have a conflict resolution system ingrained in the game text. The text advices the GM to introduce task resolution as appropriate, but there is no verbiage that would ensure for the task resolution to correspond with conflicts in any way. In fact, the game is notorious for how much task resolution its methodology engages in without any particular conflict guaranteed to be involved. Of course the same exact mechanics can be engaged with conflict resolution methodology; the simplest way is for the GM to ask the players what their characters want, after which he frames reasonable situations and conditions that allow the characters to try to accomplish their intents, after which one or more skill checks are made to find out whether they succeed - that's conflict resolution, because the GM has committed to resolving the character intents; it's also task resolution, as the CoC rules-set only provides task resolution and Luck rolls that might be used in resolving things.</blockquote>\nThat makes sense to me, and seems to provide some insight as to how I should design games.  In the case of CoC, I would insert rules that ensure the GM knows the player intent.  I have also seen other threads that focus on Conflict Resolution requiring the participants needing to know what the characters want.  That is why I was adding words into the definition of Conflict Resolution requiring knowledge of character goals.<br/><br/>Now, I find your example concerning the the monster threatening the innocent maiden that accidentally smashes the vase and scurries off guiltily to be very interesting.  It gave me pause for several minutes, in fact.  I would indeed consider that a conflict (one, in fact, that I could easily see happening in My Life with Master).  However, I should point out that character actions and intents are both involved.  The monster approached the maiden (action) with the goal of defiling her in unspeakable ways (intent).  He obviously failed in that conflict, and the repercussion was that he bumped into a vase and smashed it, attracting the attention of the father.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270436/#Comment_270436" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T08:56:20+00:00" title="May  8, 2010  8:56AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conflict resolution is not a value proposition, John. Or at least, it's not for me. I have no need to define the concept of conflict resolution in such a way as to make it applicable and useful for all roleplaying games everywhere. Conceptual clarity is much more important, as then I can apply the analysis reliably and find out the particular problems and solutions that pertain to a given design case. So as it seems to you that "conflict resolution" covers all roleplaying games, that's because almost all games do resolve conflicts. It's only when we go into more defined techniques such as stakes-setting or dramatically coordinated resolution that we can start categorizing games.<br/><br/>The above is pertinent in that I've been understanding that you're trying to get a handle on the general concept of conflict and conflict resolution, for which case the definition of "conflict resolution is resolution that resolves conflicts" is frankly rather exact. However, if we're talking of design paradigm, then there is more to be said, as long as we don't mistake part for the whole. For example, explicit methodology that tells you how to recognize and resolve conflicts? That's a good idea for near-on any game design that values clarity of drama over fleeting immersion. Immersionist gamers often critique explicit, procedural conflict resolution for the lack of organic, natural feel - I think that this is a well-placed critique for sure, but only insofar as you value organic flow more than clarity of intent. It's low-contrast vs. high contrast art, in a way: I like cell-shaded, clearly signalled comic book drama in most games because that makes communication among the group easier and ensures that the core activity of dramatic choice (thinking of narrativism here) is framed purposefully. Organic aesthetic in how we actually communicate is totally secondary for these goals, which is why I don't mind it at all when players do "metagame" and start talking about what their characters want or need.<br/><br/>From this viewpoint of good design practices we can discuss when it is a good idea to mandate that players know the intents of characters. There are many reasons for this powerful technical detail: for one, if everybody understands character intents, then everybody has a minimal window for appreciating the character as a protagonist of drama; without understanding of intent there cant be protagonism (sympathy for the character's struggle) in the technical sense. Another good reason utilized by some games is that if everybody understands what a character wants, everybody is in position to antagonize the character and initiate conflict resolution - you can't initiate conflict resolution without knowing that a character's intent is being challenged after all, unless your conflict resolution system is "always on" like it usually is in Nordic immersionism. A third good reason is constructive criticism of advocation: if other players have a window on your character's internal life, they can critique your play, which might be useful for some games.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I agree that the monster vs. maiden situation is a conflict. I don't know if I would use the word "action" or "task" to characterize what happens with the monster there, but that's mostly because I can make the conflict even more passive without changing anything essential, like so: let's say that the monster is Edward Cullen and the common intent of the monster and the maiden is to get ravished together - or is it? The two look at each other deeply, lustfully, but then turn away in a flash of realization. The monster escapes into the night and leaves the maiden to mope about, uncertain of herself. Now the situation is even more passive, the conflict (insofar as you agree that there is a conflict, still) involves no action whatsoever, merely feelings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270463/#Comment_270463" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T18:18:17+00:00" title="May  8, 2010  6:18PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>The above is pertinent in that I've been understanding that you're trying to get a handle on the general concept of conflict and conflict resolution, for which case the definition of "conflict resolution is resolution that resolves conflicts" is frankly rather exact.

If the definition applies to the systems of all role-playing games, so be it.  So:<br/><br/><b>Conflict resolution is resolution that resolves conflicts.</b><br/><br/>By this definition, then, can also assume:<br/><br/><b>Task resolution is resolution that resolves tasks?</b><br/><br/>Those statements are obviously true, since they are both logical tautologies.<br/><br/>This points out a flaw in my definition as well, actually.  The definition for Conflict Resolution should not contain the words "Conflict" nor "Resolution".  That's pretty basic when you're trying to state the meaning of something.<br/><br/>So, to move one, perhaps we should discuss how to actually recognize a conflict in a game.  That seems like it would tell us a great deal about Conflict Resolution.  If a conflict can be recognized in a game, it must have some aspects that can be observed.  What would you say are the observable characteristics of a conflict?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270470/#Comment_270470" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T20:06:08+00:00" title="May  8, 2010  8:06PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, this seems like a smart direction. Both conflict and task resolution are pretty transparent as terms - the real meat is in the concepts of "task" and "conflict".<br/><br/>The important historical meaning of conflict in this context is the <i>Sorcerer</i> conception of struggling dramatic actors. A "conflict" under this understanding occurs when a dramatic actor (a character with thematic interest) is trying to accomplish something (thematically) interesting against a source of adversity. (Sources of adversity in Sorcerer do not need to be other characters, but they almost always are; some other games explicitly only recognize character-vs-character conflicts.) This pinpoints conflict as a term that only really makes sense when we perceive the events of the game in dramatic terms to begin with. On the other hand, insofar as we accept this dramatic viewpoint as a priority, the concept of conflict is absolutely crucial to analyzing the significant structure of the roleplaying act: the concern of establishing and managing conflicts is sufficient all but alone to build a roleplaying game of this sort, as demonstrated repeatedly by modern design - many of the more lightweight games practically devote two thirds of their system to conflict management. (The same idea is present in other games, I should note; not trying to say that this was necessarily invented for the first time ever in Sorcerer - it's just where it comes into these discussions.)<br/><br/>A natural follow-up question concerns the necessity of the dramatic aspect of that definition. As it happens, an useful concept of conflict is preserved by replacing it with "whatever is the focus of interest in your play". For example, you can have a challenge-focused conflict system reasonably enough: it resolves character intents just like above, but it's only utilized under the presumption of challenge instead of dramatic weight. There's a bit more to this whole thing, but that gets into on-going game design and theory; for our purposes this whole character intent resolution thing is clear enough, I believe, as long as we remember that a practical game doesn't try to mechanically apply the conflict resolution system to all character intents ever everywhere.<br/><br/>Another potential complication concerns the nature of character struggle - or that of character intent, interchangeably. One might argue that a character who doesn't know what to do doesn't have an intent and therefore can't struggle, stuff like that. Some games make a big deal of this kind of thing and clearly expand the definition of conflict to essentially match the thematic forces the character represents against the adversity. <i>Polaris</i> is a schoolbook example of this: the conflict rules of the game are not actually predicated on character intent, but rather on what might be called the character's "theme" - the Heart player advocates for his character in an entirely recognizable way, but conflicts can happen without the character's knowledge or the character can try to act against his own best interests or whatever, really; the real conflict is between the values the character represents and the inevitable corruption and decay represented by the Mistaken.<br/><br/>(Remembering our maiden/monster example from above, it's a pretty good illustration of how "character intent" starts to break down even in pretty conventional storytelling now and then: if the monster's conflict is internal and concerns its shamefulness vs. its lecherous habits, can we really say that there is some unified "intent" in play there? What is really in play are themes, personified by characters.)<br/><br/>Considering the above elaborations, a pretty powerful and abstract definition of conflict recognizes that <b>conflict occurs in roleplaying games when fictional forces clash</b>; characters are only really the most common way for such forces to manifest in the SIS, but technically recognizable conflicts are possible without mixing characters into it as well. This is of course a rather unwieldy and possibly uninformative way of saying things, but that's anal-retentive exactness for you. For practical purposes and analysis of conventional and common roleplaying game situations it's easily sufficient to define conflict as <b>when a character's intent goes at cross-purposes with some significant obstacle</b>. That'll suffice for any game where characters and their actions are a major concern - and there are good reasons to think that characters are mandatory for dramatic games, for example, so that covers quite a swatch of all relevant roleplaying games already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270476/#Comment_270476" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-09T00:27:08+00:00" title="May  9, 2010 12:27AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2010 12:28AM by Mule.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your last post a lot, Eero; very interesting angles to the discussion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><b>conflict occurs in roleplaying games when fictional forces clash</b></blockquote>\nWould you say 'conflict' <b><i>is</i></b> fictional forces clashing?

I guess that this is the limits of language here, or limits of short forum posts - hopefully the reader has found the thing I describe in his own experiences and labeled it "conflict" successfully at this point, as I don't think I can get any more exact about it.<br/><br/>"Task" is a simple concept, it's just when a character does something in the fiction. There's no elaboration required or possible for this, really, because the concept of task seems to disappear when you remove the character; tasks are essentially Color (in the Elements of Exploration sense) or even Ephemera - they're just a description of what a character does. It just so happens that tasks - what a character does - are important and interesting for roleplaying. The really interesting theory question in relation to tasks is <b>why</b>: why are tasks interesting? After all, they don't have the fundamental structural role that conflicts seem to have in shaping play, they're just fictional details. As it happens, the answer seems to lie in the historical character-centrism of roleplaying: because player viewpoint is commonly the character viewpoint, the range of tasks that are possible for a character form the player's interface to play, which gives tasks a special role as imaginary possibilities that is not equaled by other things. Conflicts are resolved through tasks, immersing in character is done through tasks, initiating changes in the SIS is done through tasks... tasks are at the center of the fiction because of the focus on characters and what they do that roleplaying has.<br/><br/>(I'm not saying that focusing on characters is necessarily arbitrary and we might as well play roleplaying games without "playing a character". Could be that it's the bet set-up, I'm just noting above that character-centrism is a historical fact, not a prescriptive necessity.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270489/#Comment_270489" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-09T05:28:08+00:00" title="May  9, 2010  5:28AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my part, in a conflict resolution system a player tends to express the desired outcome - I want to steal the Lady's necklace from her bedroom whilst she sleeps - but not the means.

However, it would probably be much easier with the more narrowly scoped definition: <b>Conflict is when a character's intent goes at cross-purposes with some significant obstacle</b>.<br/><br/>In this latter case the most likely observable elements are the character and the obstacle.  I agree that intent is also key to recognizing conflict.  Unfortunately, intent may or may not be observable.  Wouldn't you say that game rules that want to focus on resolving conflicts, then, need to bring character intent out into the light, so that we can actually be sure that the intent is addressed?  How can this be done without requiring the player to state his goal in some fashion?  Without that, it seems that any system will regularly falter in addressing the conflicts that are of interest to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270515/#Comment_270515" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-09T13:34:16+00:00" title="May  9, 2010  1:34PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if the player himself knows what his character's goal is, and the player is then allowed to have certain influence over the direction of play, and if he's mandated to use that influence to accomplish his character's intent, then the intent never needs to be actually spoken aloud. D&amp;D's combat system sort of resolves conflicts like this: the player never has to reveal what his character is fighting <i>for</i> - he just fights, fights, fights, until resistance crumbles, and then he'll get to declare what his character does with the victory. Not that there's a lot of variety in that after-fight action most of the time, but technically speaking even the simple intent of defending oneself or stealing the riches of the monsters will get accomplished task-by-task, without ever commenting on what it is that the character is trying to accomplish overall.<br/><br/>So the intent doesn't perhaps have to be known by everybody playing for it to be accomplished consistently. My understanding is that the ideal of immersionistic play is that <i>nobody</i> knows the character's intent, not even the player playing him - the player just immerses in character and does not analyze his goals, after all. Insofar as I know, though, we couldn't call the freeform immersionistic system reliable in resolving conflicts, exactly. Conflicts get resolved insofar as the players manage to shape them into something resolvable within the conventions of the game. This can be difficult, especially when you don't stop to think what it is that the character wants. Luckily Nordic immersionism doesn't much care for conflict resolution; the official dogma is that players playing the game need not and should not have to be aware of such internal workings of play as conflicts, and play is being successful whatever happens in regards to conflicts as long as the fiction is credible and so on.<br/><br/>Looking at historically efficient conflict-resolution systems, almost all of them do bring character intent out into the light in some way. This might be an artifact of dramatic games being most interested in conflicts: in drama we have the special consideration that the players are ultimately audience for what the characters do, and dramatic protagonism requires them to be able to appreciate the motivations. Thus character intent in conflicts needs to be discernable either explicitly or implicitly for the players to be able to appreciate the drama. It might theoretically be that similar audience concerns wouldn't influence games that do not have dramatic goals regarding the audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270555/#Comment_270555" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-09T22:57:32+00:00" title="May  9, 2010 10:57PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's D&amp;D example in the last post also reminds of In a Wicked Age.

But when the conflict is over, the winner and loser are both in a position to influence things, so intent then comes to light after the fact without having to be mediated through a GM and players reading each others minds (the big failing of traditional task resolution systems).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270667/#Comment_270667" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T19:17:31+00:00" title="May 10, 2010  7:17PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>Looking at historically efficient conflict-resolution systems, almost all of them do bring character intent out into the light in some way.

I also agree that games like D&amp;D can be used to resolve conflicts.  But, it is not efficient in doing so because it does not explicitly require intents to be stated.  So, sometimes the actions undertaken by the characters actually resolve conflicts and at other times they do not.  As NomdePlume points out, for D&amp;D's rule set to be able to consistently do so would require mind-reading abilities on the players' parts.  My own game Legendary Quest has similar issues (although the next edition addresses this problem though the introduction of Negotiated Contests).<br/><br/>When looking at "historically efficient conflict-resolution systems", many of them bring out character intent explicitly through the act of setting stakes.  It seems to me that any game that uses Negotiated Contests like this is explicitly trying to address character intent and is, therefore, trying to resolve conflicts.  I can't see how a Negotiated Contest could be used otherwise.  (You discussed earlier how a Negotiated Contest could be used to resolve tasks in certain cases, but I believe that such a use would simultaneously resolve conflicts as well.)<br/><br/>However, as you point out, a game may be set up to have a player state his intent only after winning a contest allowing him to do so, as In a Wicked Age does.  Now, what he states at that point may not be his <i>ultimate</i> intent, which may be out of reach of the particular contest in question and which may actually remain hidden until later, but it would move him closer toward his intended goal.  Does that make sense?  <br/><br/>So, a Negotiated Contest is one way to bring character intents to light in order to ensure the central conflicts that are important to players is addressed.  In a Wicked Age uses another technique, whereby no negotiation transpires between players, but the winner's intents come to light by virtue of the fact that the winner is allowed to state what happens.  Are there any other techniques to reveal intent that you have seen in other games?<br/><br/>I have to say that what you describe as "ideal immersionistic play", where nobody knows the character's intent, doesn't sound to me like conflict resolution at all.  In fact, it just sort of sounds like play-acting to me, although I've never tried that, so I could be wrong.  In any case, I don't think that case should cloud our discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270668/#Comment_270668" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T19:43:57+00:00" title="May 10, 2010  7:43PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other ways of resolving conflicts... it's an interesting question, certainly. As established above we have many varieties of stakes-setting that explicitly determine whether the character's intent should come to pass, and then we have games like IaWA that ensure the primacy of intent by having the players negotiate the stakes post-resolution within certain parameters established by the rules. Are these two categories exhaustive? I see no analytical reason for them to be so, but counter-examples are thin on the ground if we're looking at effective and consistent conflict resolution systems. "Have the GM decide" is both effective and consistent (insofar as the GM is instructed to recognize and resolve conflicts, that is), so I guess that counts.<br/><br/>Some games twist the stakes-setting procedure by having the stakes hardcoded regardless of character intent. This works because the game ensures in other ways, mostly by genre management, that whatever is hardcoded into the system will be a matter of conflict. Dance and the Dawn, Polaris, Zombie Cinema, Under the Bed and other such games that have a prefixed dramatic arc often make certain key conflicts of the story unresolvable by whatever system is mostly used for conflict resolution in the game. For example, a typical rule is that you can't kill a player character without having the dramatic arc run its course. Dance and the Dawn is a particularly clear example, because the game actually does not include a general conflict resolution system at all: the only conflict you get to resolve in the game systematically is the issue of whether your lady gets the right husband or not. Any other conflicts are subsumed to this one.<br/><br/>There are also games that resolve conflicts by narrating over them with general narration powers. Your average parlor narration game, such as Once Upon a Time, does this: conflicts are established insofar as the players manage to set up a coherent drama, but their resolution is left up to arbitrary narration on the basis of general creative tension between the players. This might be more like the immersionistic case in that the conflict resolution won't be explicit and reliable because the players do not have an imperative to resolve conflicts by their narration.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that there is more variety to conflict resolution when you get digging and find out those weird experimental edge cases that are developed in game design. It's an interesting field of design for sure, as the management of conflict is rather central to a dramatic roleplaying game. We can perhaps be pretty confident that explicit recognition of character intent and having the GM decide are the most common and successful methods overall, perhaps because of their overall effectiveness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270697/#Comment_270697" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-11T08:09:27+00:00" title="May 11, 2010  8:09AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a little sidenote:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>The really interesting theory question in relation to tasks is<b>why</b>: why are tasks interesting?[...] tasks are at the center of the fiction because of the focus on characters and what they do that roleplaying has.<br/></blockquote>\nI just wanted to say that this is a very interesting observation.

You are saying that players of IaWA actually negotiate post-resolution.  Earlier you stated that the winner merely states his intent, and that no negotiation transpires.  The winner just gets what he wants.  I'm going to guess that this was a merely an unfortunate choice of words, but I wanted to clarify that.<br/><br/>Actually, I was pondering today whether the IaWA resolution system was a novel implementation of the Generalized Contest pattern.  From what I understand, it seems to me that the stakes are set prior to the introduction of the conflict, which is the definition of a Generalized Contest.  If you win, you get to narrate whatever you want.  If I win, I get to narrate whatever I want.  That leaves the field wide open for what actually happens, but the players actually understand the potential consequences of winning and losing within the "parameters established by the rules".<br/><br/>Your examples of games that "twist the stakes-setting procedure by having the stakes hardcoded regardless of character intent" is quite interesting as a game design technique.  But, I don't know if that actually pertains to the topic at hand, which I see as identifying alternate means of extracting character intent from players.  I'm not familiar with most of the games you've listed, so I am quite possibly wrong.  But, I've read through Polaris and listened to some podcasts of play, and that game, at least, definitely falls into the Negotiated Contest category.  It uses ritual and key phrases in clever ways to allow the negotiations to be made smoothly without breaking the narrative mood (i.e. "You ask far too much", "That was how it happened", etc.), but I don't see how it could be classified as anything but a Negotiated Contest system.<br/><br/>So, from what I've understood so far, Conflict Resolution falls into the three categories of Negotiated Contests, Generalized Contests, and Player Fiat.  Of these, Negotiated Contests reliably extract player intent, and Generalized Contests may be designed to do so if the rules allow the winner to narrate the outcome of a conflict post-resolution.  I would be quite pleased to be proven wrong in my assessment, as that would likely teach me something useful.<br/><br/>Adam's reference to Fred Hick's proposal of splitting the concept of conflict into clarity of intent and granularity of resolution is also thought provoking.  I think his separation of intent into the three categories of opaque, clear, and relevant is insightful. However, I don't know that he goes far enough in his granularity of resolution.  Certainly many games have contests at the task level, and almost all have some form of mechanical resolution at the scene level (if only that the last person standing is the winner).  However, virtually all games also have conflicts at a level higher than individual scenes.  For games like D&amp;D, this is resolved through GM fiat ("I guess you've killed enough minions, now you get to encounter the arch-villain in the final battle.").  But, others handle it even more explicitly.  My Life with Master, for example, triggers the players to have their minion characters overthrow their master when certain mechanical events transpire, initiating an End Game scenario.  This hierarchical structure of lower-level contests feeding into higher-level contests I call a <a href="http://felix.plesoianu.ro/rpg/design-patterns/doku.php/pattern:contest_tree" rel="nofollow">Contest Tree</a>, which says nothing about how "granular" a game designer should make his lowest-level contests. <br/><br/>I'm not sure what to make of parlor narration games, or even whether they should be included in this discussion as it is debatable as to whether they are even RPGs at all.  If there is a conflict resolution system in these, then it seems to me to fall under the "Player Fiat" banner.  Certainly my own parlor narration game, "MacGuffin", falls into this category.  And, having looked through Once Upon a Time, I believe that one does as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270754/#Comment_270754" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-11T22:56:10+00:00" title="May 11, 2010 10:56PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you read or played IaWA? The game involves a negotiation phase after conflict resolution; the resolution itself determines which character gains primacy in the conflict, while the negotiation establishes the consequences of the events. Winning the conflict matters in the negotiation phase because the winner can default to injuring the loser, should the negotiation break down. However, it is usually more useful for the character if the player negotiates directly to achieve whatever it was his character wanted, as most of the time the characters do not actually want to injure each other so much as to gain something despite the resistance of the other characters. Considering the role of stakes in the whole matter, we can say that the "stakes-like" establishment of conflict scope and purpose happens in this post-conflict negotiation.<br/><br/>As for Polaris, the hardcoded conflict I speak of is not the general conflict mechanics of the game, but rather the constraints within which those mechanics operate. For example, you cannot ask for the death of the player character before the character's become a veteran, because the most important hardcoded conflict in the game directly involves the character's life: the star knights are fated to either betray their people or die tragically in their defense, and which one'll happen is strongly regulated by the rules: you can't do the ultimate betrayal before Weariness reaches its final value, and you can't die before the character has at least some Weariness. Even when death is an option, it doesn't go through the general conflict resolution mechanics, but rather requires specific player choice. This issue is clearly a conflict, but the rules specifically set it aside from special regulation, making that a somewhat different conflict management mechanic from the usual stakes-establishing systems.<br/><br/>Your analysis of granularity in the scope of the conflict is a good one, nothing to add there. You're also probably right in that a parlor narration game will likely resolve a given conflict via player fiat, although any tendency in play for conflicts to align along the lines of mechanical interaction allowed by the game is also interesting: it's an open question whether players of f.ex. Once Upon a Time will instinctively commit to championing specific fictional forces against each other, thus making the player-level competition a conflict resolution system. I've seen that now and then with the game, and it seems that the players get most excited with the game's haphazard narrative model when they can have a coherent competition that reaches into the fiction; for instance, if and when players notice that one is trying to get the established prince and princess hitched up while another wants to get the princess killed, that's different as an experience from when everybody's just trying to narrate random, fragmentary snippets. The game is notorious for its lack of fictional coherence, of course, so that sort of thing isn't exactly common.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270872/#Comment_270872" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T21:59:43+00:00" title="May 12, 2010  9:59PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you describe of the IaWA conflict system seems to be a combination of Generalized and Negotiated Contests.

However, to bring this "task resolution" into play, you must have a conflict between two dramatic actors.<br/><br/>Finally, the system allows the players to circumvent the outcome--instead of applying the "damage" to one of the parties, they can use that as a benchmark to negotiate a resolution to the conflict.<br/><br/>Thus, any given conflict in the fiction which leads to the dice being rolled can emerge as task resolution or conflict resolution, depending on how the players decide to negotiate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
