I'm pretty excited to do it again. It's one of my favorite events of the year.

Soon we'll be doing the game planning bit, when we solicit games from people coming. But you're welcome to sign up after that starts. We should have some more slots, and we'd love to have you there.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
