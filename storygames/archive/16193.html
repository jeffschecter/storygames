Unfortunately this post hasn't gotten a lot of attention, though whether that's because <i>I Am Alive</i> is too obscure of a title for anyone to have any thoughts on it, or whether the gameplay doesn't evoke must interest in roleplaying similar situations, I couldn't say.  I thought it was worth posting here because the idea interests me.<br/><br/>For those who don't want to click through and see what's up with the game, I'll try and summarize.  In the aftermath of a cataclysmic event that's killed most of humanity and left our civilization in ruins, a man named Adam travels cross-country to locate his family, hoping against hope that they will have somehow survived.  There are no mutants or sci-fi tech or turbocharged road machines or even psychic maelstroms in this game.  Rather the people this man encounters are either scratching out a desperate existence against all odds or preying on those who do.  Our hero starts out the game with an unloaded gun.  During the course of his adventure, he <i>might</i> manage to get as many as two bullets to load his weapon and defend himself.  The rest of the time he must rely on his machete and the bow he picks up along the way.  A bow with one arrow.<br/><br/>In the city where he prays he'll find his family, things are shattered and many times walking at street level is impossible due to blinding dust storms that can choke the life out of a human being in no time.  Consequently Adam spends a great deal of time climbing through the higher ruins.  What makes this part particularly nail-biting is the fact that Adam is an ordinary human being who's been living on starvation-level meals for a year.  He's not super-strong and the act of hanging off ledges or jumping from place to place costs his endurance, some of which he can lose <i>permanently</i> if he pushes himself too hard.  And it's easy to push too hard.  Sometimes it's impossible not to.<br/><br/>At any rate, <i>Apocalypse World</i> was pitched as a possible emulator, but I don't think it works particularly well.  Sure the subject matter is similar, but <i>I Am Alive</i> focuses on a couple of key things: desperation and weakness.  Yes, it's possible, and even recommended, to pitch an <i>Apocalypse World</i> game at that level, where scarcity is a prime motivator, but even if there was a playbook that fits a character like Adam (there isn't), that still leaves the matter of replicating the physical toll survival takes on the survivor.  I <i>guess</i> one could do something like inflict harm as the result of a 7-9 or failed roll, but that doesn't seem quite right and isn't in keeping with the game as I read it.<br/><br/>So what to do?  It almost feels as though it'd be best to hack together some custom thing that hits the appropriate notes, but as I've said many times on this forum before, I'm no game designer.  There's some real mileage to be gotten from a story about desperation, want and unwavering hope, so it's not like the exercise is pointless.  I'm just curious how some of the thinkers over here would address the issue.<br/><br/>[<a href="http://youtu.be/cWqFNwUKFtw" rel="nofollow"><i>I Am Alive</i> trailer</a>]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
