Nowadays, I have to seriously draw the line else I will find myself playing in or running seriously awesome games every goddamned weekend with friends (on top of 1-2 weekday sessions). So I'm torn: It *is* fun, it is *free*, and there's lots of stuff to do, and the folks running it are hands-down awesome...

And there is indeed a small contingent of indie folks running more hippy style games, most times. However, the best part of it was always rubbing shoulders with the ENWorld community and putting names to faces; if you don't frequent the boards, I'm not sure a drive all the way down from the capital would really be worth it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117377/#Comment_117377" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-01T21:03:37+00:00" title="January  1, 2008  9:03PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the people playing in a more traditional style usually look like they're having a blast.

Then, on the spur of the moment, I ran a bizarre sci-fi session that started off with an hour-long world-building mini-game that was almost as much fun as the session itself. More on that later -- I need to finish typing up my notes...<br/><br/>Anyhow, it was a blast. I hope to see some of you at the next event. <br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141585/#Comment_141585" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T08:17:56+00:00" title="April 29, 2008  8:17AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, Raphael ran us a great, tight game of <i>Dread</i>.

Raphael, how may proofs did you order that had the over-cropped cover?<br/><br/>I read all of the player rules Sunday (and enough of the GM rules to know... well, DAMN, dude. METAL!); and I'll post an RPG.net Review within a few weeks. I am in Game Chef, I am helping to run the follow-up Layout Competition there, and I wanna get <i>For Mature Audiences</i> laid out in parallel with the comp. Oh, yeah, and I have some work to do at my job, the next few days. (Whew!)<br/>----<br/>I also got in a game of <i>In A Wicked Age</i>, and now I see what all the fuss is about (e.g. the April Fool's site change). It's another Baker masterpiece: very slick integration of mechanics, narration, and awesome. I didn't see ALL of that awesome at the table, though, because (I found later) we weren't quite playing the conflict rules right. In part, this was to smooth play for new players (i.e. all of us but the GM), but I think some of it was flat-out misunderstanding of round order. No biggie--still fun as hell--but there was a time or two when we missed out on the Firepower of the Fully Armed and Operational Battle Station.<br/><br/>Oh, and I got a free copy of THAT game, too, by being on the top of the We Owe list at game end. I know, I know--that's pretty easy to manipulate, and I confess that, once I hit the top, I wasn't gonna take that advantage die for love or money--I wanted that copy! In retrospect, I know I kinda "cheated" or "metagamed," and the GM prolly should have given the game away based on a vote for best role playing or a random draw or something.<br/><br/>But, hell,  everyone seemed to enjoy it anyway... excepting MAYBE one dude, who never quite grokked the narrative power in his hands, nor seemed best pleased when my character offed his, to prevent him from interfering with my plans to attain Great Power from Baal--but that is another story....<br/><br/>Great Game Day, for me; and I will be sure to make it to the next one!
