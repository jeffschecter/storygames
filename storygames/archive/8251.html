The players are heroes in Arthas's army (6 lifepathers that have important stations in the army: two captains and a chaplain specifically) who are desperately out to change the world (more of their particular beliefs in another post if anyone is interested).<br/><br/>I've posted my play reports in my LJ (<a href="http://wildljduck.livejournal.com/tag/burning+warcraft" rel="nofollow">http://wildljduck.livejournal.com/tag/burning+warcraft</a>) but it isn't necessary to read them.  Mostly I'd like some feedback on things that have come up in game that I'm not sure how to deal with:<br/><br/>1. How Flexible is a FORK?   I was open to almost any idea that included a clear using of the skill. Debating with Oratory, while FORKing in Doctrine to speak the religious ideals and Philosophy to talk about the decisions we make as men define who we are,  all seemed very reasonable to me.  Some however, like using seduction to impress the village women who had no say in the outcome I vetoed because, while some villagers might swoon, the judge officiating the hearing was utterly unmoved by them (he even has a belief that says so).<br/><br/>2. DoW Question. What happens when you Obfuscate vs. a Rebuttal? Who speaks first? How do you play that out? <br/><br/>3. DoW Question. Does loosing an Incite really give your opponent advantage dice equal to the margin of error? In our case the defender was granted 8D on the next test due to a botched Incite roll, Avoid the Topic, Will 6 and +2 OB from the Thick-Skinned trait, which seems over the top.<br/><br/>4. How is reputation earned and lost in game?  I have a Paladin who staked his own life on defending a villager from abuse.  Because he killed a soldier over it (in cold blood, no warning), he's going to be publicly beaten and humiliated.  I want the result to be that the soldiers think he is a holier-than-though-asshole and for the villagers to think he's a hero.  Would you represent this as a 1D Reputation "Protector of the People" or give him two 1D reputations "Traitor" and "Peasant Hero".  How much should one have to do in order to gain and/or loose reputations?<br/><br/>5. Does a fast Artha cycle ruin games? Burning Wheel is much grittier than Warcraft.  In order to add a more fantastic element, I've been very generous with Artha.  I started the characters with 3 Fate, 2 Persona and 1 Deed.  So far in the two games the Paladin (who admittedly has done A LOT to peruse his BITs) gained 5 Fate the 1st game, 4 Fate and 1 Persona the second game.  He gained each of these by following his BITs based on the rewards system in the book, but I think I'm being more lenient than most GMs would be.   Considering these are characters who have traveled through the Dark Portal,  kill fantastic monsters, and will eventually see their leader become the Lich King, I want to add a greater level of fantasy to the game, I'm just not sure if this will cause it to break. Any advice on this?<br/><br/>6. Consequence of Failure. As I've been playing I realized that if there is not consequence to failure, I don't want to see a roll.  The character doesn't gain a test, they just succeed (or fail if it is impossible to perform).  For instance, one player wanted to train his troops.  I said "Great, you train them, mark that down as practice time on your instruction skill."  Another player found a fallen knight, I wanted to have him make a perception or field dressing check to see if he was still alive but realized this fallen knight was going to kick off a major conflict in the game.  If the player failed the roll, believed he was dead and left him, I would have been somewhat up a creek.  So I just said "you see his chest moving slowly and can sense a flicker of lift left in him."  No perception roll, the character just knows.  What this means for me is that every time a player picks up the dice, they stand to lose something if they fail.  It could be an argument or an arm, depending on the struggle.  Do you think this is too severe a requirement for a test?<br/><br/>7. Another DoW Question: In DoW and Fight you are supposed to raise the skill based on the hardest test you made during the conflict.  How do you keep track of them? I found that we ended the DoW and then said were racking our brains to try and remember the lowest dice vs. highest ob test that was made during the conflict.  Also what about using other skills besides your dueling skill.  I\u2019m not talking about a FORK, but an actual skill use, for instance dueling with Oratory as your primary skill, but using Ugly Truth to Incite?  What about helpers.  If in each exchange a helper helped out with a different skill (Ugly Truth this time, Etiquette the next, and Hunting on the 3rd) what trait do they mark for advancement?<br/><br/>Thanks for any insight you can provide.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181609/#Comment_181609" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T17:40:51+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  5:40PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should ask these questions in the <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/" rel="nofollow">BW forums</a> for official responses, but here's some from me:<br/><br/>1. Flexibility of FoRKs is up to the group unless explicitly disallowed in the rules, with final authority to the GM. Your two examples seem perfectly fine to me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>2. Play it out as you will, but mechanically the Obfuscate is rolled to see if there's +1D or +1 Ob on the next action and the Rebuttal does nothing.<br/>3. The BW subsystems contain significant player skill. Incite is far less likely to be correct than any other maneuver. In this case someone scripted Incite against minimum Ob 6+2=8?? If you resort to screaming at your opponent in an argument and it doesn't upset them... yes, I think you did it right.<br/>4. Infamous Reputations. In this case something like Traitorous Peasant Apologist 1D. That's +1D to Circles with the peasants, and +1D +1 Ob (yes, both) to Circles with the soldiers.<br/>5. It doesn't cause it to break. Just so long as everyone's on board.<br/>6. This is exactly how BW should be played. Every roll at the standard resolution system level should matter. In subsystems like Fight! it's likely and okay that not every roll matters, but at the top level you're spot on.<br/>7. Keep track of them by actually keeping track of them. If you just rolled Oratory 7D vs Ob 5 jot that down then after the conflict or something go back and figure out your tests. And you get 1 test per skill per conflict, so you can get an Oratory test <i>and</i> an Ugly Truth test. The hypothetical helper could get 3 tests, one toward each skill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner" title="Sean Nittner"><img alt="Sean Nittner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner">Sean Nittner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181616/#Comment_181616" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T18:56:59+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  6:56PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Greedy, thanks for the feedback.  I looked on BW FAQ but didn't even notice the forums.  I'll post it over there as well.  Onto the specifics.<br/><br/>3.  Yeah, this was the case of a blowhard sergeant trying to intimidate the paladin into submission.  He called him a murderous dog who was no better than the Orcs they were fighting.  Tactically I knew incite was a bad move for him, but it was very fitting for the NPC and I wanted to see how it worked.   Badly doesn't even come close to describing it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>4. At first +1D +1 Ob sounds really strange, but considering the disposition rules this will probably work out well.  Finding a Soldier that actually likes him his going to be tough.<br/><br/>7. Wow.  I was totally short changing my players.  Luckily this was the first game with DoW so everyone understands there is a learning curve (including for me) but the helper is going to be happy.<br/><br/>Thanks again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181630/#Comment_181630" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T00:38:54+00:00" title="December  5, 2008 12:38AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sean<br/><br/>1. A FoRK is whatever seems appropriate. But don't let a player run down his skill list asking "can I fork Rigging? Can I fork Mace? Can I fork Cheese-wise?" Get some roleplaying out of them - if a player has a good reason why he can fork Knots into his Spear test ("the tassles on the end of my spear are very distracting due to my superior use of knots!"), then its all good. If the player can't come up with a reason, or any narration that supports it, then say no and make them roll the dice. And ask for additional narration for each subsequent fork - that cuts down on rolls with more dice from forks than from the original skill.<br/><br/>2. Test Obfuscate first (a Versus test). Then roleplay the Rebuttal based on the outcome (either nothing or a decent rebuttal of the failed obfuscate).<br/><br/>4. Reputations are subject to player vote, pure and simple. I think there might be a limit - raised or lowered by 1D per session, but otherwise its pure nomination and vote. Which means the players have way more control over there reputations than the GM does. They could be world-renowned in three game-sessions if they really think they deserve it. Read the description of scope for each level of reputation, and yeah, check Infamous Reputations, where you still get the extra dice, but a Ob penalty as well. I seem to remember Infamous Reputation being better described in Burning Empires, but I might be confused...<br/><br/>5. I let players add extra dice via Persona after they roll, instead of before, and it still works fine. If they spend Artha on every single test they make and still have more and more left after each session, then you might want to think about pulling back.<br/><br/>6. Yeah, you're good.<br/><br/>7.

Every time they are about to roll something hard I remind they how they could spend Artha before (persona or deed) and after (fate and deed).  The players are pretty exited about extra dice and about exploding 6s so the Artha moves fast.  In the very first game a player make a Circles roll to find Uther Lightbringer (a very prominent figure in the canon).  I told him that Uther was around but on a very important mission.  The letter would reach him and he would return but if the player failed the test, I was invoking the enmity clause and Uther would be furious that one of his own knights would cry wolf and pull him from his duty.  Second roll of the game. Player rolls, and fails. BOOM! He drops a Deed to reroll circles. I told him how rare Deeds were but he really wanted this.

And that's why you're bad.<br/><br/>Luke,<br/><br/>Let me tell you why I think Johnstone's making the right decision. It's because we only gain 0-2 persona per session. I like what you're saying about commitment, but it sucks to spend that 1 point to get 1D and then you roll and either you're still short or you actually have 3 extra successes and that 1D was totally irrelevant.<br/><br/>Making important decisions and commitments is really great. Having them become irrelevant due to chance is sucky. And by sucky, I mean boring.<br/><br/>As you suggest, it'd be "Well, I'll have to sit down and calculate the likelihood of succeeding here."<br/>As Johnstone suggests, it is "Well, fuck. I have been dead weight on this pirate ship for the past two weeks, and this was my one chance to really earn my spurs and regain their trust, and I blew it. You know, this is worth enough to me to spend my Persona point. I'm still not winning, and it's worth it to spend my ONE AND ONLY deeds point."<br/><br/>I would have never spent a Deeds point on a Resources test if I was forced to make that decision before the roll. Because rolling a deeds point wasn't an interesting decision AT THAT POINT. It became an interesting decision when the failing result put into sharp relief the fact that this roll was too important to fail. I knew that rolling wouldn't be an irrelevant decision, though I might still fail.<br/><br/>I did indeed still fail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181937/#Comment_181937" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T07:54:06+00:00" title="December  7, 2008  7:54AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Deeds points can be spent before a roll to double your dice, or after a roll to reroll failures. That's a function of Deeds points. It's part of what makes them so much more powerful than Persona points.<br/><br/>Fate and Persona are comparable. They work as they do -- Fate after a roll, Persona before a roll -- to provide a strong incentive to mix up your roleplaying based on what you're going to need for the next session. They encourage you to play your Beliefs, resolve your Beliefs or play against your Beliefs, depending on your needs.<br/><br/>By spending Persona after the roll, you make Persona points much more powerful than they should be and skew the incentives, including damaging the incentive to play to earn Call-On traits.<br/><br/>Failure is a feature of the game. At its heart, Burning Wheel is a game about choices and consequences. Persona points force you to make a choice whenever you roll: "How much do I care about this outcome; what am I willing to spend to get it?" When someone says, "I'm spending a Persona on this!" it's a flag for everyone else at the table to sit up and take notice. And when someone says, "I'm spending three Persona on this!" eyes will be glued to the table because we know the outcome is important to the player. That stuff is an important element of play. We get excited because someone cares about an outcome enough to risk a precious resource to get what they want. The risk is the important element that makes spending those Persona points a strong element, and that's really what you're mitigating when you spend them after the roll.<br/><br/>Also, even if you spent Persona and it turned out you didn't need it, or you failed despite the expenditure, you're still rewarded by logging those Persona points toward an epiphany in the ability you rolled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181945/#Comment_181945" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T09:33:53+00:00" title="December  7, 2008  9:33AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Thor said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181951/#Comment_181951" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T10:02:32+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 10:02AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having read Thor and Luke's comments I offer the following commentary:<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent psychologies will react differently.  I'm 100% with the choices and consequences design goal.  I'm not convinced that spending the points before helps reinforce that goal while spending the points after diminishes it.  For me it would have the exact oppositive effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpending before is a gamble.  Spending after is a price.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find "What price am I willing to pay for success" to be a far more compelling and meaningful question than "What I'm willing to gamble for success".  I deal with risk every day, Risk is a big amorphous cloud with certain quantifiable parameters and as a result I find the find the behaviors around dealing with risk to be pretty mundane.  Spending points afterwards on the other hand is a more known cost.  I have X successes, I need X+1, I need to spend Y points to assure (reasonably) success...is the success worth those Y points?  That question I find compelling.  Much more so than the more random guessing of spending points before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat may just be me, but I suspect that the game design goal of choices and consequences is fully supported either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181957/#Comment_181957" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T11:02:32+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 11:02AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2008 11:05AM by Guy Srinivasan.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's random guessing either way, as it sounds like you well know. But you are asking the wrong question for Burning Wheel. It is not about what you're willing to pay for success, it's about which beliefs you stand up for and which you change. "Failure is a feature of the game." Think of Persona in BW like signaling behaviors in real life. That's the role of Boon. (It's not a perfect analogy since signaling behaviors are a collective loss but personal gain, etc. etc. but imagine that, it's not a perfect analogy) Persona is a limited resource you can use to point to things and say look! I care about that! (and other uses, like buying off a couple types of failures, but we're ignoring those, I think).<br><br>The price that the character has to pay in BW is changing her beliefs, not spending Persona. By elevating Persona to the status of The Price, you make it much too important for what it is, and would need to change a lot of other things about it, too. By focusing only on the reward "higher success rate on this roll" for spending Persona, you skew your perception of it. It also leads toward powerful traits related to that roll, and toward Epiphany.<br><br>Plus if you really wanted to spend Persona after the roll as a measure of what price you're willing to pay for success, you'd change it in a different way. For example: before the roll state what price 2X you'd be willing to pay for success, in number of Persona. After the roll, if you fail by at most X successes, you must spend 2X Persona. You succeed.<br><br>But this "roll to see whether or not you even get to decide what price you'd pay to succeed, then roll to see whether that price is enough" mechanic that you're using now seems fairly backwards, and I find it much more likely this "gamble/pay" reasoning is a justification of an arbitrary decision earlier rather than the reason you decided to use Persona in a different way. That's just the way brains work.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181959/#Comment_181959" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T11:08:57+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 11:08AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple thoughts:<br><br>BW RAW states you earn Artha in real-time. Thor etc. are strong proponents of pushing the payday to the end of the session for ritualistic reasons, and I played that way by default my first few campaigns (I learned BE first, and that's how it's done there), but going back to real-time Artha has had some very interesting and positive impacts. For one, if you're earning Persona in real time that means you can do a Persona-y thing (probably Moldbreaker; it's the easiest real-time Persona payout) and then immediately plow that choice into gambling on a very important roll. Maybe my players have short attention spans, but they're pretty focused on the immediate session and not on future sessions.<br/><br/>A vitally important part of the Artha economy is built into BW's advancement scheme. When you spend a Persona on something and it still doesn't net you a successful intent, it wasn't "for nothing": it was a vote, an investment in which skill(s) you're aiming to shade-advance down the road. If you're just dropping Persona willy-nilly then you're never going to advance <i>anything</i>. But once you've started purposefully plowing Artha into a very small range of skills/stats/abilities, soon you find yourself self-vetoing Persona expenditures -- <i>shoot, I would really like to succeed at this Observation test, but I want to advance my Strategy skill even more</i>, for example. If you move Persona to the back of the transaction, you're introducing a conflict of interest with the Advancement system.<br/><br/>Finally, the "what price will I pay" question is already addressed in how failures play out: the resulting complications <i>are</i> the price.

The fact is, this group wants more post-roll options ("paying the price") than just Fate and Deeds. Fate is dependent on 6s, Deeds are super-rare. Is switching up on Persona points the perfect answer? No, I don't think it is - it's just the one we're using right now.<br/><br/>Play style affects other aspects of Artha, as well. This group is not comfortable with Workhorse, MVP, and Embodiment awards (actually, I can't see anybody I game with really getting into that part, even the people who haven't played BW), so Persona points are primarily gained from goals, so they are less plentiful than Fate. Yes, a generic fan-mail-type award happens sometimes when a player says "hey, you should get a Persona for that thing you did, it was cool" but not every session.<br/><br/>We're still pretty new at BW (even me), and we're gadually figuring out what parts of the game we really like, and what parts we don't want to deal with at all, and what parts we'd like to try in a different implementation (which of course will lead us to BE and/or MG). But we're not making arbitrary decisions. For example, we tried both in-game and post-game versions for Artha awards, discussed it, and settled on post-game wrap-up, pretty much for the same ritualistic reasons Thor advocates.<br/><br/>Games, like drugs, affect different people differently. That's a tight system, Thor, no doubt, but all those incentives aren't going to be working the same for everybody. I mean, I can probably argue for and against all the points made in this thread so far, but that's beside the point.<br/><br/>My <i>original point here</i>, was that the game doesn't break if you make a big change like that. And I'm standing by that! It might annoy the author, and he might call you names on the internet, but the game will still work fine if you want it to play that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
