Maybe the players are just a little more resistant to the call?<br/>\nAm I missing the point of the game or do you think the same?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236785/#Comment_236785" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T11:10:46+00:00" title="October 10, 2009 11:10AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi back again trying to get some help, I like Summerland but think its Trauma rules while great and well thought out are not going to work with the group I play with.<br/>\nSo I thought to drop them completely for now.<br/>\nThis does remove the characters ability to resist the call from the sea of leaves.<br/>\nSo I was thinking of replacing it with something else? Self-aware or just Self<br/>\nMy Plug in rules idea:<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf-aware or just Self<br/>\nI think the Sea of leaves removes Humanities Quality of self-awareness. Reducing a persons awareness on a scale from:<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf - Confused - Lost  - Wild - Feral<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Characters encounter the call from the Sea of Leaves the call level has to be determined depending on were they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 0 Home among Friends<br/>\nLevel 1 The edges of the sea of leaves<br/>\nLevel 2 Within the forest on paths or it\u2019s beginning in sight<br/>\nLevel 3 Dense forest following markers no path<br/>\nLevel 4 Dense forest unexplored leaving markers for return journey.<br/>\nLevel 5 The Deeps. 5-30<br/>\n<br/>\nThe level of the call is the number of dice rolled to determine its strength<br/>\nLevel 3 = Three six sided dice a value of 3-18<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a character sleeps within the forest. (Use the same mechanic used in the game for conflicts and distress)<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on the distress level created by the difference between the level of the cal and the characters roll for self.<br/>\nIf the character wins he sleeps soundly, but if the call overcomes the characters sense of Self determine the level of distress i.e. Cosmetic, Minor or Major (Page 47 Summerland book).<br/>\n<br/>\nCosmetic Distress\tConfused \u2013<br/>\nMinor Distress\t\tLost  -<br/>\nMajor Distress \t        Wild<br/>\nFeral \u2013<br/>\n<br/>\nFeral has been purposefully left blank for if the wild character is not quickly bound or subdued he will become feral in the next scene.<br/>\nThere is a werewolf theme here, which I think could be sprung on characters as they explore the depths of the Sea of Leaves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want the characters to have no idea about this game only that they are average people possibly on a plane flight which when coming into land through the cloud base find the sea of leaves! The runway over grown.<br/>\nAny ideas or criticism much needed<br/>\nRegards Blods                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
