Basically, I wanted a game that people would wear on their shirts. I like the prospect of just putting on your shirt for the day and not knowing if, when, or how you would end up playing. I like the idea of two potential strangers sharing a bit of ephemeral gaming fun and then going on their ways. Or maybe they even strike up a conversation and end up becoming friends.<br/><br/>So, what nature of game?<br/><br/>- Well, 2 players seems pretty necessary. I suspect it would be difficult to ensure you see 3 people wearing shirts together at the same time.<br/><br/>- Short, simple rules. We can't have people carrying around small rules booklets to consult. It should be something everyone can remember, preferably something intuitive, along the lines of charades.<br/><br/>- It should pivot pretty strongly on the interaction between the content of the two shirts. If there are enough different types of shirts, the combination between the two is what will keep it fresh to play. Even better if we can add a third element in to increase the number of combinations geometrically.<br/><br/>- The shirts should be easily identifiable from a distance and not otherwise offensive to wear around. <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/generic/b597/?cpg=cj" rel="nofollow">This shirt</a> is a good model.<br/><br/>- Something geek-friendly but not geeky. People should want to wear the shirts right?<br/><br/>I have a few ideas but nothing that wows me. Any thoughts or ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236301/#Comment_236301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T07:00:45+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  7:00AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Justin,<br/><br/>Danielle and I brainstormed the exact idea a couple of years ago.

Perhaps every "Shirt Type" has its own rules, like a CCG or Munchkin, or *changes* rules slightly, like FLUXX. Perhaps the upper sleeves of every shirt have the basic rules (in reference format) while the front has the Shirt Type rule tweaks.<br/><br/>* The back could have SLIGHTLY different rules, meaning if the other notices you from behind, they have those "Back Rules" to call on (perhaps an advantage? backstabbing?) instead of the "Front Rules" which (conversely) ought to be "your best foot forward" (default "power" or "advantage").<br/><br/>* The base rules also include elements relating to the color of the shirt. Faction? Modus Operandi? Mood? Emotional options? Dunno. But with Shirt Type and Shirt Color, you have two axes of "character customization"... and you might sell even more shirts at CafePress. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> But there's your third (fourth, counting Shirt Back Rule Variants) element.<br/><br/>* Perhaps there is an RPS resolution element with some aspect of Shirt Type breaking ties; or you could use oddsies (each person shows one or two fingers, simultaneously; odd total number of fingers means "aggressor" wins; even means the "defender" wins). Heck, you could use total change in both player's pockets as some kind of "over/under" mechanic.<br/><br/>* Something with the hook half of Velcro: maybe you have a game board or a "game state matrix" that engaging with another player changes; you show the change (and active alternate rules/effects?) by moving one or more Velcro... counters... tokens... pieces to different spot on the matrix. Or do it with pin-on buttons easily made or bought from a crafts store?<br/><br/>* In a similar vein, you could add rules that have to do with arm or wrist bands (or anything easily obtained by the players). Really, the sky's the limit, if you allow for "Accessory" rule tweaks.<br/><br/>I'm about as stuck on brainstorming as you, though, without a vision of how it would play. Not procedural but... thematic? CA? I mean, I could see this being a largely gamist thing, great at cons, involving some simple strategy and (with Back Rules) a touch of The Assassin Game. Or I could see it being some kind of emo/improv thing where strangers immediately drop into emotional or generally extreme scenes, like a sort of "microtheater" REALLY intended for lookers-on, to "freak the mundanes," so to speak. Or it could be more like a scavenger hunt (can you catch them ALL?!?) with a challenge mechanic to determine who collects and who must keep searching?<br/><br/>Would there even be a setting? Would it have a canon? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I wasn't thinking of anything that complicated.<br/><br/>FWIW, my leading idea right now is a riff of the <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/44614" rel="nofollow">new card game</a> / old internet game: Who Would Win? Your shirt has a "character" on the front and a list of "challenges" on the back. You see someone else with a shirt and challenge them to a shirt fight. You stop a passerby and ask them for a minute of their time: You turn around and have them pick a challenge off the back of one of your shirts. Starting with the challenger, you each get a half a minute or so to convince the passerby of why your character would win the selected challenge. The passerby declares a winner. The loser has to give the winner something: their spare change, a coupon to Arby's, a hug, a declaration at the top of their lungs that they got pwned by the winner, etc.<br/><br/>I'm torn about using a passerby. On the one hand, I like the social aspect of it. OTOH, that ups the barrier to play. I'm also a little stumped on what to do with people wearing the same character on their shirt.<br/><br/>And what characters. The new card game version mostly uses real people, e.g., Brett Favre, Mark Twain, Marie Curie, etc. I was thinking of something more generic and geek-friendly, e.g., superhero, caveman, pirate, zombie, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236325/#Comment_236325" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T08:50:30+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  8:50AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two quick thoughts:  You could use the back of the shirt (which is perpetually hidden from the wearer and the opponent, if they are face to face) somehow, like the guessing game where you put your own identity on your forehead.

OK, that's quite a different kettle of fish. In essence, rule-less, with "third-party fiat" as a resolution mechanic. Hell, it needn't be characters only: why not various monsters, beasts, even ideologies! (Hmmm... a political game where the ideologies "flash debate" how to resolve a particular socio-economic issue?)<br/><br/>That would work. I don't know if the third-party thing is good or bad--totally depends upon the region, location, time of day, etc. At a con, no problem. On a city street during rush hour, problem. At work, maybe impossible.<br/><br/>One thing's for sure--it will be all about the art, if you go that route. Not just "Ninja" but a ninja with all the accouterments and maybe his dojo in the background; not just "Pirate" but a pirate with a parrot and a ship under foot and so forth--all those Aspects of the character art provide hooks for justifying how it might win in a challenge.<br/><br/>Ooo! Don't have the loser give the winner anything, tangible or not. Rather have a "I PWNED:" or "Defeated:" listing on the back or down the sleeve(s), and the loser must sign it and note the Challenge Number at which he or she lost (number the challenges on the shirt backs)! Yeah, it means folks have to buy an industrial-grade Sharpie or fabric pen, but that's no biggie.<br/><br/>So one question, then: why (or where is) the role playing? This could go the route of Nomic or Mafia or other "debate" games--some folks might role play, but there's no inherent requirement to do so, nor would there be a benefit unless the third-party was good humored (i.e. the guy role playing would likely freak a mundane, while the guy making a normal, conversational, logical argument would seem to be more plausible, to many). That's what had me thinking of shirt color as a factional element or an M.O. or agenda/goal: that could hook into role playing better, maybe, than just "why my guy wins" (which is, basically, "Nu-uh"... as in, "Nu-uh, 'cause my ninja would kill your parrot with a shuriken!" ... "Nu-uh, because my pirate shoots your shuriken out of the sky with his pistol" ... "Nu-uh, because my ninja threw a smoke bomb in front of the pirate, blinding him so his shot goes wild." ... etc).<br/><br/>I'd also worry that there's nothing emergent. Consider: I get my shirt, I read my challenges, and I think for a bit about how I would best do each one. Now I'm basically scripted. Something RPS/Circle of Death has to be in there to throw a monkey wrench into the works, to prevent every challenge from being like the recitation of a Curriculum Vitae by each player, with the third-party just waiting for a chance to pick one and get on with life. SOmething requires a REACTION by each player, not a PRESCRIPTION of how each would handle the challenges. (Even if you "cross-challenged--I have to do a challenge on your shirt and vice versa and the third-party decides who did best--I could still quickly learn the list of all challenges for all characters and be almost as prepped as I would be if I only had a chance of doing one of my won challenges.)<br/><br/>Anyhow... not to shoot down the notion. I just don't think there's much more game to going that simple than there is in Nu-Uh or My Guy or Mafia. And I see no reason to role play other than, perhaps, to be more charismatic to a certain type of third party. Maybe the happy medium is the place to look? Nothing so "board gamey" or "CCGish" as my idea, but with more meat than Nu-Uh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236330/#Comment_236330" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T09:05:56+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  9:05AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Two quick thoughts:  You could use the back of the shirt (which is perpetually hidden from the wearer and the opponent, if they are face to face) somehow, like the guessing game where you put your own identity on your forehead.

SO the game could have something akin to "deck building," with customizations? Nice.<br/><br/>And also... DAMN. Anyone could mock up the shirts and, thus, bypass any revenue stream (i.e. profit margin add) you might use either via CafePress/Spreadshirt or actual "print runs." They knock-off sports teams stuff all the time, and those franchise have some REAL money for going after copyright violations. Maybe moot, though--any "prop game" can be homemade, come to think of it; and yet Looney labs still monetizes Mafia by re-skinning it (i.e. they sell Werewolf cards even though the game can be played with any deck of cards, including homemade). Fuck it--table that problem until there's something approaching a viable product!<br/><br/>(Hmmm... or maybe the product IS the rules, and home-making the shirts is ENCOURAGED, though you also provide tools for buying them (i.e. a front-end for Spreadshirt, with your copyrighted graphics available to use?).<br/><br/>Anyhow... you can see I like the idea. it's basically a LARP, played exclusively with props (and maybe a pen or what-not). Heck, maybe the thing to do is to brainstorm a SYSTEM, and then skin that to do various themed games? Think Munchkin and all its variants, or FLUXX: they stand alone and can mix in weird ways. (Rifts: The T-Shirt LARP?)<br/><br/>Yes... I'm a generic RPG whore.
