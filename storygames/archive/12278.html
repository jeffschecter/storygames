GM or no GM... Stats or no Stats... even playing a character... color mattering is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's what makes RPG special. I love video games, card game, board games... many games where what you describe doesn't mechanically matter but when it comes to RPGs... I want it to matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nColor for its own sake doesn't work for me. I do it. But it feels incomplete.<br/>\n<br/>\nColor that just determines what stat you roll or as justification of using a trait also feels empty.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet, color being much more important than mechanics also feels off. I prefer structure to complete freeform.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the lamest feelings I experience in an RPG is where we say awesome things and then roll a die, and what we said has no consequence on that roll. I sometimes enjoy the dramatic irony... say something awesome... fail anyway or say something risky or doomed to fail... succeed! But not every time. It loses its impact pretty quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt feels less lame when I roll and then roleplay. At least one is informing the other and they aren't separated. But still it feels a bit empty.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet, this doesn't bother me when I play an RPG with map and minis. The act of positioning my mini for some sort of tactical advantage makes me fulfilled. I can deal with color not mattering mechanically here. Positioning is my color.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, when I play a game like Mutants and Masterminds where my character obtains a car in the fiction... but mechanically, the car doesn't affect anything till I earn Power Points to pay for it after the fact (and I could have bought a car even if I didn't obtain one in the fiction)... it feels disconnected. It's usually a game balance or resource management issue. But I want the fiction to trump all of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275274/#Comment_275274" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T22:56:32+00:00" title="June  9, 2010 10:56PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2010 10:57PM by lordgoon.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the hardest time with this when I'm GM-ing a game where the characters have all sorts of elaborate "social" stats. <br><br>On the one hand, if Jimbo's character is trying to persuade the Evil Emperor t spare his home planet, I hate to just say "roll a persuasion check" without having him try to roleplay the scene first, which might either obviate the need for the check or else at least allow me to add modifiers. <br><br>On the other hand, unfortunately, Jimbo might be a guy who's a whole hell of a lot less articulate and imaginative than his character's supposed to be.

Its core idea is that instead of dicing, conflicts (it has a modern conflict resolution system) are resolved by having the GM evaluate the concrete description of the action that the player provides. This description is then numerized in a clever way and compared to a target number. It's really screwy as an experience at first, as you're constantly feeling like it's more deterministic than it really is, but it does at least ensure that description matters: in fact, I would go as far as to say that FLOW (the rules-set behind the game) forefronts the action in a supremely immersive way on the expense of consequences, as creative energy is directed at narrating and experiencing the action in minute detail.<br><br>I have to say that I don't myself need quite this level of connection between the spoken word and the mechanics of the game in my routine gaming. Rather, while I agree with you that the fictional situation is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, it's enough for me when that situation is in equal parts informed by and informing the rules mechanics of the game. The Solar System strikes a good balance to my tastes in this, as it gives you a bit of condition modifier harshly limited, a bit of stakes negotiation that forefronts fictional positioning, a bit of this and that, but ultimately the system is still formalistic: whatever else happens, the game always comes back to a simple Ability check. (It's interesting to compare my preferences in this with Clinton's - a close reading of the original TSoY rules text leads me to conclude that a character probably can't get a car in that game without paying the Advance for it, while in my rules text it is explicit that the fiction trumps the xp pacing, but at a cost: you get your car and get to pay for it later, but meanwhile you're paying a penalty in a different currency for not being able to pay the xp just yet.) I like this level of connection between the fiction and the mechanics, where both are strong and indispensable partners in the system.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275276/#Comment_275276" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T23:27:09+00:00" title="June  9, 2010 11:27PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you play Wushu, John?

A 5-foot fall is +2 damage, while a 7-foot fall is +3 damage, and this fall was 6 feet, I guess we round down, oh wait is there a modifier for landing in soft mud maybe -1 and AARRGH.  For me, "What seems plausible?" is much more fun.  Though Jesse's example of "3 things to watch out for" sounds manageable, provided that really was all you needed to look out for.<br/><br/>But, John, I know you said you like your mechanics too and you don't just want freeform.  <br/><br/>So, what about mechanics that kick in first and then create color in the narration of the steps and outcome of resolution?  Like, y'know, we get to some point in a scene where we want to know if you seduce the guard or get reported, and we roll some dice, and then the dice tell us that you get what you wanted but not to an extreme degree and there's also a downside... but that's not enough info to imagine what happened, so we necessarily color that in some interesting way.

It's an obvious target for a group-based adventure game, yes. Also, the game is very good, well-written and honest - in fact, the best Finnish roleplaying game ever (with the ever-so-slight possible exception left open for <i>World of Near</i> and <a href="http://lotfp.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">LotFP</a> depending on whether they count as Finnish ;D). One of the few clearly written and executed simulationistic games.<br/><br/>Alas, the game's materials seem to all be in Finnish at the moment despite Vuorela's English-language blog. I've been pushing at him to make an English version of the game, perhaps that'll happen soon. The game's easily of international indie level, seems a shame for us to keep it all for ourselves.<br/><br/>Also, about the topic: I agree with Jonathan that the interesting field of the question is about the different ways the fiction can matter. In this regard any true roleplaying game will have some sort of an answer: there is no game that does not allow fiction to matter while still being a roleplaying game. I suppose that the real issue here is that rpgs traditionally adore commitment expressed as narrative: a good player will say stuff that expresses how he's paying attention to the fiction. This can be hard when your resolution system doesn't care.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275294/#Comment_275294" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T02:54:03+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  2:54AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the advantages of free systems where the GM assigns bonuses is that the players' colour can give them those bonuses. Unlike J Walton, I think this is freeing, not stunting. To give an example, in My Life With Master, the emotion die is practically the only way which a player's roleplaying contribution can affect a mechnical outcome. Where players feel they are being "judged" and consider that to be negative in principle, or disagree with the GM's judgement in particular, this isn't going to work, but for most groups, it's fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne trick I've found useful is to look at the players' contributions through the lens of their character's stats, particularly if there is a disparity between the player and the PC s and assign bonuses accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the point at which you narrate colour is important - if you start narrating amazing colour before resolution, there will of course be disappointment when it doesn't happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/QHudspeth" title="QHudspeth"><img alt="QHudspeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://quentinhudspeth.com/journal/wp-content/themes/atahualpa/images/H%20Logo%20super%20extra%20small.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/QHudspeth">QHudspeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275305/#Comment_275305" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T05:54:28+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  5:54AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm afraid all I can do is commiserate with you John.<br/>I, too, prefer color to matter, but I have not yet found that perfect balance.<br/><br/>In my recemt <a href="http://www.hudspethgames.com/StarLost" rel="nofollow">Star Lost</a> campaign we adapted an idea I got from <a href="http://www.amagi-games.org/" rel="nofollow">Amagi Games</a> which we called "wouldn't it be cool if..." cards. Players could create a scenario (wouldn't it be cool if x happened) and vote on how much they would like it to happen by paying from a meta-game currency called Chutzpah to place a bounty on the card. Whoever got the outcome to occur would earn the Chutzpah voted onto it. Chutzpah is spent to fuel re-rolls, add additional dice to rolls, or take over narration in the game \u2014 all in an attempt to foster agency in the players. It worked, to a certain extent, but sometimes not.<br/>For example, in one scenario the characters were in a restaurant/bar dealing with underworld sleeze. Chutzpah could be used to add scenery to a location layout (which were typically built on the fly). Someone added in a decorative fish tank. Someone else thought, "wouldn't it be cool if..." the fish tank accidentally exploded during a fight. Awesome. We loved it. Everyone was trying to get the fish tank to explode, short of shooting it directly (and thus spoiling the spirit of the idea). Someone even Jackie-Channed off the damned thing to avoid a burning puddle and land a kick on a bad guy. And we <i>never</i> got the tank to rupture, leaving the outcome up to dice rolls. It was a little disappointing. Sure, someone could have spent Chutzpah to narrate that the tank explodes, but that would have cost them what they earned from the bounty. The fellow who caromed off of it could have spent Chutzpah to tweak the dice on the "does it burst" roll, but I think he was tapped out after the roll for the attack. So, no win. It was all pretty funny and became a running joke in the final days of the game (and still crops up in other games we play). I don't think it bothered my players as much as me, but it stuck in my craw as a failure of the system. There should have been a way other than GM fiat to affect the outcome of the "rupture" rolls without just spending Chutzpah. But I had no stunting rules in place. I thought Chutzpah was sufficient. And, maybe it is. Maybe I'm just annoyed that we couldn't explode the damned tank.<br/><br/>Q                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275308/#Comment_275308" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T06:37:19+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  6:37AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you not played Polaris.

It's usually pretty obvious.<br/><br/>As for "Can't the fiction be important in ways other than [making] you more successful?", the <i>Exalted</i> example is a slight help here as well, even though this isn't really obvious (or, perhaps, even intentional). But after you play for a while, you notice that, aside from the "make me more successful" stuff, stunting actually does two other things that are sort of only marginally implied in the rules: 1) it lets you bend rules. Now, this might just be seen as some other flavor of "making you more successful", but it feels different in play. 2) it provides a mechanism for the player to inject things into the setting. For example, suppose a player does some kind of acrobatic stunt using a tapestry that runs from the ground floor to the third floor ceiling. All well and good, but no one ever mentioned the tapestry before. The player just assumed there was one there, and now there is. And what's more, this tapestry is now begging for other players to use it in stunts that "make use of the environment". In other words, in addition to making his character more effective, the player also just gave the whole table more opportunities for memorable shit to happen. It's like a Jackie Chan scene... you might not notice the ladder is there at first, but as soon as Jackie picks it up, that ladder now <i>matters</i> to <i>everyone in the room</i>, at least for a little while.<br/><br/><i>Exalted</i> does many, many things badly, but it's stunting system has always impressed me. It's very useful for the type of social stuff people have mentioned above, where you get a mix of what is said vs. skills the character has both mattering in any given situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275311/#Comment_275311" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T06:57:41+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  6:57AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got into the habit in my local group of calling this sort of thing 'stunt fatigue'. It kind of encompasses a number of different potential drawbacks to the 'cool description for bonus' approach-<br/><br/>a) Players tend to shoot their creative bolt early in the session/scene, when they have lots of ideas, and can often dry up just at climax where they would have wanted the most dramatic description.<br/>b) Description can have a rote quality when it's done just for a mechanical bonus (OK, <i>this</i> time I <i>back</i>-flip and hit him with a <i>soup spoon</i>).<br/>c) Players can sometimes be so busy working out what they're going to do next they're not listening to the current dramatic description, rather ruining the point.<br/>d) Sometimes all the elaborate description can slow things down when you just want to <i>resolve the damn scene, already</i>. Players get bored, particularly if their character isn't in that scene.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that systems that reward description are defective. But I generally prefer a light seasoning of description-heavy actions to a bowl full of the stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275313/#Comment_275313" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T07:09:07+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  7:09AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2010 7:13PM by jenskot.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, can you tell us more about Stalker.

Unless the fiction is actually about that. I may be playing a character who is reserved, delicate, and patient. Playing to that, describing that color, should matter as much as being loud.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want my description to matter but I don\u2019t want it to be a vulgar attempt at overt persuasion or judged by its entertainment value. And description doesn\u2019t have to be in character roleplay. Just an explanation of what\u2019s happening in the fiction and how. It could be devoid of emotion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m also not a huge fan of one person judging descriptions but with a good GM it can work well and I\u2019m ok with it. I try not to play with GMs I don\u2019t trust in this regard so it\u2019s often not an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, we\u2019ve tried a few times distributing judgment authority and it has had mixed results but just like with the right GM, with the right players it works great. For example, in our Shadowrun hack the players collaboratively determine the difficulty by sliding tokens back and forth. It\u2019s fast, instant, feels fair, and we have an increased sense that what we say really, really matters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275317/#Comment_275317" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T07:28:08+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  7:28AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ultimately, it\u2019s not actually about success for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ve seen people really want what they say to be important but sometimes it\u2019s really that they don\u2019t want to fail or it\u2019s an ego driven thing.

Specifically how the GM evaluates the player\u2019s descriptions?</blockquote>\nThe GM in FLOW considers the player's contribution in two categories, Idea and Roleplaying; the former basically concerns the immediate realism of the character's proposed course of of action in the fictional context, while the the latter is about whether the proposed course matches with the abilities and nature of the character (and whether it's entertaining for the rest of the group and dramatic - entertainment concerns are usually scored in this category). Basically you fare well in the game by describing action that seems likely to succeed in achieving the stated goal while remaining true to and expressing with clarity who and what the character is. Both of those categories are scored on a 1-5 range (there are various scoring tools in the book to help in this), and the results are then multiplied with each other to gain a final score, which is then compared against a difficulty level also determined by the GM. Characters have skills that can influence the final score, too. There are some neat fine details like how failed attempts still change the situation (a very modern conflict resolution "draw rule", in fact), how successes and failures can be graded and so on. I especially like how the player characters have hero points that are also hitpoints: whatever the adverse effect of failing a challenge is, the player can negate it by spending a point. As combats and such are by default lethal challenges, this basically makes the hero points into hitpoints as well. The math is elegant, as the player performance has an exponential scale while difficulty scales linearly.<br><br>The weirdest thing in that whole system is that it's all in the GM's head, and the players basically have no mechanical input into it whatsoever aside from using the get out of jail free card when a challenge goes awry. To an outside observer the system doesn't differ from GM fiat in any way whatsoever, which is pretty neat if you're into immersionism and mechanics not "getting into way". From the GM viewpoint it's pretty different from pure fiat, though, as you're on your honor to utilize the authoritative yet reasonably objective standards of evaluation provided by the game. I myself make the scores public when playing, in fact, instead of just telling the player that he succeeded or failed; this can be pretty intense, as any pretense of the adjucation being something else than an expression of the GM's creativity is swept aside: your goal is to get rated well, and you only get rated well by having a good creative relationship with the GM. Matrix Games have a similar feature in how they rely on the players judging each other's contributions.<br><br>Stalker is among the most honest authoritative GM games that I've seen alongside <i>Dread</i>. It also differs from the latter in that while Dread encourages the players to quiet down and listen calmly to the atmospheric storyteller, FLOW encourages active narrative and active participation: the life and death of your character depends on you being sharp and on the ball, visualizing the GM's world correctly and suggesting courses of action that make sense. I like the fact that there are now two game texts in this common yet underdesigned genre that I can respect as pieces of game design.<br><br>Hmm...

I think that's partly a scale problem.  If you are making a lot of rolls for similar things (say a series of attacks) in a short period of time, it can be hard to keep up interesting color.  Especially if you mechanically need to give color, you often end up with a lot of "pinball" moves just because they technically involve the scenery.    Surely that is at least partially a problem with having too many rolls in a part of the game you don't care as much about -- at least not enough to justify the amount of time it takes -- and the idea of mechanically forcing color phrases doesn't make it any quicker.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I agree with the OP that the interaction between color and mechanics is pretty core to fun play.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275339/#Comment_275339" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T09:57:11+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  9:57AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a huge difference to me between "add colourful description here for a bonus" (which often turns into "add colourful description or suffer a penalty", if it becomes the default) and "the System (in the Forge sense) inspires/provokes interesting descriptions, twists, consequences".<br><br>The first feels like dancing for your supper; the second is a fun romp.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275340/#Comment_275340" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T09:58:54+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  9:58AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh: and that's probably because in the first case your description doesn't really matter--it doesn't matter WHAT you narrated, just that you did (like describing wounds in D&amp;D).

I understand what you're saying.<br>\n<br>\nWhat it seems like you are describing in your parenthetical is that I have a choice of 3 mechanical effects through my characters actions.  Which is cool, but which is also what happens in Eurogames.    If there is just a requirement that I say some potentially cool phrase when I make my choice, how is it much different from describing combat maneuvers for a +1?<br>\n<br>\nMaybe that is part of the answer.  If my color is going to mean something, it has to give the other players more than just a telling them what mechanic I invoked.  To use the example above, if I describe a tapestry into the fight, perhaps it opens up ideas others wouldn't have had before.  If I just describe grabbing a candlestick and hitting with it, it is mostly just a justification for an attack and less interesting color. If I describe grabbing your character's girlfriend  (who wasn't in the scene before) it is stronger color and maybe too strong.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275413/#Comment_275413" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T17:03:17+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  5:03PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2010 5:03PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey John (S.): I'm really curious about the 3d6 D&amp;D thing.

I think anyone who's ever played Exalted understands the weird disconnect between an awesomely described stunt and a mechanical result that does not reflect that awesomeness. Some of that is poor technique: we should be describing stunts up to but not including the final execution. But some of it is IMO just crummy design. It's extra-crummy when the net result is players constantly fishing for more dice, without actually adding anything substantial to the preresolution fiction.<br/><br/>So I think it's the intent/task split in BW that was the big fix for us: You can describe an awesome character action, <i>the character can even actually do the awesome action</i>, but the technical execution of the action is divorced from the intent behind why you, the character's author, were doing it. This works less brilliantly in the context of combat, where the actions usually *are* the intent.<br/><br/>I also like that working up the initial die pool is almost a purely technical exercise: what's my skill, what are some FoRKs (thereby reinforcing the fictional approach I'm taking), oh hey here's some help dice (pulling everyone else into the fiction-making), and only <i>after</i> all that do I describe how it looks in the fiction, lobby for an advantage die from the GM, who may also grant an advantage die of his own based purely on fiat and taste. It's a nice back-and-forth, that pool building exercise. <br/><br/>Anyway, yeah, not at all a fan of games where the fiction isn't <i>required</i> to be taken into account in the final resolution. Which is maybe what you were saying in the OP.<br/><br/>p.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S" title="Aaron_S"><img alt="Aaron_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/780/nLP7HPA6K2AES.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S">Aaron_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275713/#Comment_275713" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-12T10:26:17+00:00" title="June 12, 2010 10:26AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not really on-topic, although Eero's and John's posts have been quite fascinating... just a Stalker fan-boy moment...<br/><br/>When I was eighteen, I watched the Tarkovsky film, and loved it so much I spent the next year somewhat aimlessly trying to adapt it as an RPG.

These 2 restrictions really helped speed things up and in play didn\u2019t feel like players were reaching just to grab bonuses. The same idea as Wushu but in play felt very different to me.

It\u2019s very situational. <br/><br/>In D&amp;D, describing my character hiding allowing me to roll my hide skill is technically my description affecting mechanics. But it often doesn\u2019t feel that way. Especially if every hiding situation is the same, regardless of what I or the GM says, the descriptions feels more and more disconnected from the mechanics. But it\u2019s not that simple.<br/><br/>If the only way my descriptions matters is describing how I try to hide (regardless of what I actually say), then that isn't different than my 3d6 example above. My description matters but mainly as fulfilling a very basic requirement. <br/><br/>If hiding is the obvious solution, then description matters less. If there are many solutions but not every solution (or skill use) applies, then descriptions starts to matter more and more. The specific skill list also matters. If the list is small and situations so discrete that it\u2019s usually really obvious what skills apply (say you use diplomacy for 90% of talking situations), then descriptions starts to matter less. <br/><br/>If I\u2019m playing a game where what skill I roll is the only way I can affect the mechanics, I could see my description really mattering in a game where\u2026 the situation is mostly open ended (but with limits) and then I describe what I\u2019m doing in the fiction, and then the GM decides or suggests what skill I roll.<br/><br/>I would likely want my color to matter more than that, but I think that would at least cover the bare essentials.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275973/#Comment_275973" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T13:44:11+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  1:44PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Mouse Guard, you have to describe how you are trying to achieve your goals otherwise we don't know what Stat/Skill you will roll. Describing how is fun, because you get to add to the fiction and position your character so that rolling the skill not only makes sense but is fictionally possible (perhaps you must overcome another obstacle before being properly setup to attempt your original roll).<br/><br/>If this is the only way my description matters, I would feel like my description mattered somewhat since the situation is open ended but it would feel minimally satisfying to me. Fortunately in MG, it doesn't end there.<br/><br/>My Character, Cole, needs to get to the pirate town up north to stop my captured friend from being sold as a slave. I want to find a path to get there as quickly as possible. The GM asks me how? It sounds like a Pathfinder roll but I only have a vague idea of where I need to go, let alone the fastest way. I can just hope for luck but there is so much on the line and I'm not good at Pathfinding, that's Kyle's job, and he's the one that was captured! <br/><br/>But I have many options that aren't just describing something awesome so the GM can give me a bonus die. I can buy a map, find (circles) a friend (or even enemy) that I can try to persuade to help me, I can use my Forest Wise skill as help, if time allowed I can try building tools, and many other options. Regardless of what I do, there is plenty of mechanical support to take how I describe what I want to accomplish, and break it down in reasonably objective ways to determine how one fictional action will support/hinder the next fictional action as I prepare for my pathfinder test.<br/><br/>The end result is that I really felt my description mattered! And it didn't require a GM or other players judging my descriptions (although I enjoy that as well).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275989/#Comment_275989" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T14:46:23+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  2:46PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/>I'm with you. If my descriptions don't have any actual impact on probabilities (or <i>something</i> mechanically meaningful), I lose interest. I checked to see if I was spouting bullshit just now, but, sure enough, all of my own designs work this way. In <i>The Rustbelt</i>, if you describe yourself pressing an advantage, you get an Advantage die, which is basically a re-roll. In <i>Super Action Now!</i> and <i>Hex Rangers</i> (and a host of others that I haven't played yet), your description determines which of your traits you may roll/draw cards for, which directly adds to your total potential effectiveness. In <i>MADcorp</i>, the Ref is instructed to apply bonuses for especially well-formulated versions of actions, and penalties for stupid ones -- all the way up to, for example, searching for the right thing in the right place with the right method is almost certainly an automatic success, but getting any of those wrong drops your chances.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I think the tough part about introducing color first and then using it to dictate mechanical operations is that you wind up exerting lots of mental energy on measuring and categorizing the fiction. A 5-foot fall is +2 damage, while a 7-foot fall is +3 damage, and this fall was 6 feet, I guess we round down, oh wait is there a modifier for landing in soft mud maybe -1 and AARRGH.</blockquote>\nOne way to fix this problem is to qualify things rather than quantifying them. I.e., change that rule to "a short but sharp fall is +2 damage, a high fall is +3 damage" or something like that, and pass the moment of judgment to the appropriate player/GM/whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275991/#Comment_275991" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T14:48:29+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  2:48PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Yet, this doesn't bother me when I play an RPG with map and minis.

The long list of numbers quickly become unimportant compared to what I need to accomplish in the fiction. <br/><br/>If I need to find help, it doesn't really matter what the value of my Circles Stat is. The number represents how likely I will or won't suffer consequences trying to get what I want. But I will likely get what I want.
