All I feel is that Costikyan is right if you accept that a good story can only be linear, where a game "...is non-linear. Games must provide at least the illusion of free will to the player; players must feel that they have freedom of action within the structure of the game." (Quote from his article.)<br/><br/>However, to produce a good story, you got a structure to follow. Structures are nothing more than rules and techniques. I don't see why several people can't follow the same structures to build a story together. The different opinions of the people will create a freedom of action withing the structures of the game (where taking other peoples' opinions into account is part of that structure). And there we are: games as stories. And if you don't think collaborative story creating can be game, then we're back into "What is a game?".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428880/#Comment_428880" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T06:38:21+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  6:38AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the key insight is that there are two crucial elements of stories that many RPGs are really good at replicating:<br/><br/>* Character decisions are based on characters' situations, beliefs, values and priorities, not on "the needs of the story".

Playing a story game is like <b>writing</b> a story.<br/><br/>My experience is that writing a story is decidedly non-linear.

Costikyan seems to focus on RPGs that provide gradual character development and unfettered player decisions about their character. The assumption is that in order to create a narrative structure a GM has to force their will on players through fiat in order to impose a plot.<br/><br/>Of course, there are games that have no gradual character development and begin with a Situation pregnant with conflict such that the characters, in pursuing the goals that the players have established for themselves, inevitably create a "narrative of events (external or psychological) which moves through time or implies the passage of time, and which involves change" to use Ursula Le Guin's definition of a story, with the predominant mode of change in RPGs being conflict among characters or between characters and the environment. But even Costikyan admits that RPGs can create stories. He just recognizes a tension between story and game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429085/#Comment_429085" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-03T20:50:33+00:00" title="March  3, 2014  8:50PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He doesn't feel the same way.

I think the article is easily criticised, it implies that story and game are antithetical because games are not engines that manufacture fine literature, as though story is only story if it meets a demanding criteria. As mentioned here it implies that story is a tangible product and that it cannot emerge  spontaneously from play. So, I don't agree with that but I still think that story vs game is a good read to help you set your own design values. There are some good responses to his argument from within the video game fraternity too.

My Life with Master is a resounding and (I think) successful refutation of <a href="http://www.costik.com/gamnstry.html" rel="nofollow">my argument</a> that making a game more like a story makes it an inferior game, while making a story more like a game renders it an inferior story. In this case, we have a game that, by moving away from "game" and toward "story" has created something quite novel--and quite interesting. It has done so through one fundamental insight: That we can keep the system "a good game" by constraining the narrative arc at the expense of freeing the moment-to-moment action. Thus, what My Life With Master seems to say is that: Good story depends on constraining action through narrative consistency; good games depend on constraining action through adherence to system (within which free interaction is permitted); and both can be achieved by providing a system that <b>enforces narrative consistency</b> while permitting freedom in other spheres.<br/><br/>This is.... almost a mind-blowing idea from my perspective... </blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429104/#Comment_429104" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-04T09:59:25+00:00" title="March  4, 2014  9:59AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I see something he wrote in 2007 mentioned at the bottom of that second link too.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/noclue">@noclue</a>, what is TBP?</blockquote>\nSorry, The Big Purple.
