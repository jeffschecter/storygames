To my mind, a safe space doesn't necessarily mean that better ideas get put out first, but that more ideas get put out, so that we can find the good ones even if they're declared second or third or fifth or whatever. <br/><br/>A place feels safe, to me, when I can set an idea on the table and say, "I think I'd like to pursue this kind of action or dialogue, but I don't have it honed or ready yet." And then other players say, "What if?" or "You could also" or "That's great, go with it" until the idea is refined and ready to be plugged into the fiction. <br/><br/>There's great collaboration in there, when my character can seem tough or witty or quick or savvy or whatever because she's drawing on the best ideas of the whole group.<br/><br/>A place where any idea is considered sacrosanct because it was said out loud might feel, I don't know, <i>supportive</i> but it can feel <i>artificially</i> so to me. It doesn't feel more safe, 'cause I'll just assume that people are judging a weak idea inside themselves. For me, putting out an idea and then saying, "Except that's sort of shit, isn't it? What can we do that's better than my current idea?" is a behavior made possible by a safe space... but I'd worry that it wouldn't be allowed under a self-flagellation limit.<br/><br/>To me, a safe space doesn't mean everyone's protected from all bumps and scrapes, it means that no one holds a grudge and that we keep a first-aid kit handy. YMMV, obviously.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352797/#Comment_352797" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-30T08:20:25+00:00" title="December 30, 2011  8:20AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham just made me think... there should be like, different types of safe spaces. You need a safe space for horror centered games, where humor shouldn't go too far. You need a different one in games with tons of drama, lika gray ranks. You need a different one for games that ask a lot of creativity from the players. I'm not talking about the ambience and how you get there, but the first moments of the game after the genre is proposed and before preparations are made. Perhaps you will need different techniques to create safe spaces.<br/><br/>If you need to create a degree of trust with stranges or even among old friends I'd reccomend the oldest evolutive trick available: non-threathening, absolutely-not-sexual, brief personal contact. If you make it a sort of ritual prior to the game, better. Why you say? well:<br/><br/>-This is gonna be probably the most awkward moment of the game. In fact, you can start the game stating "we're doing this because it's gonna be the most awkward thing we're gonna make today. Everything from here is going to be downhill"<br/>-Once people are beyond that point, all other defensive shells they had or presumptions about the game will be gone. Perhaps they will even relax and laugh a bit, if the ritual turns out to be ridiculous enough.<br/>-Non-threatening human contact is the most reassuring thing ever invented. It has evolved into an universal tool for expressing levels of trust. Think handshaking and hugs.<br/><br/>I'm not even thinking going to the point of handshaking or hugs, even that can be too awkward between total strangers (though those people that give hugs for free can prove me wrong) What I'm thinking is just this:<br/><br/>1) all party members stand in a circle, barely at arms reach of each other.<br/>2) Now they put their palms on the shoulders of the people at their right and left, arms fully extended, sorta football-team thing, except you don't hugh each other, just put your hands on the shoulders of the people beside you.<br/>3) Look at each other's eyes and say the credo of the game. Like "I'm going to make you awesome" or "we play together" or even "we bleed together", whatever helps you get not only into the safe space but in the mood of the game if you want.<br/><br/><br/>Ok, just a rough idea and writing it feels as awkward as reading it... well it makes a little more sense in spanish, at least for me, but perhaps it can be adapted to your group of players in a less scary way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352798/#Comment_352798" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-30T08:23:26+00:00" title="December 30, 2011  8:23AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Is it definitely trust we need?</blockquote>\nYes!

I can shake hands, I can share snacks, I can join a game in a separate room, I can sit in a tightly squished space where everybody pokes everybody else with elbows because there's not much space to sit in. But if you tried to do the trust building exercise above, I wouldn't let you touch me and most probably I'd excuse myself from the room and then run like hell. All trust exercises set off an alarm in my head because they read like forcing me to trust someone.<br/><br/>3. choose a game that doesn't have prejudices and pvp hardcoded in it. If it does, there needs to be preexisting trust. I only played things like Dogs in the Vineyard, Witch, Love in the Time of Seidh etc when I had a "buddy" and/or knew the GM (same thing really). On the other hand I got stressed as hell when I found out that a Famous Published Author was going to play Montsegur with me (hey Graham).<br/><br/>4. in general, I'd say to choose a game that doesn't have pvp in it, but this might be because of my dislike for small group everyone-against-everyone pvp that I discovered this Indiecon.<br/><br/>5. incidentally, handouts with rule summaries are nice because they remind you of the game terminology which facilitates speaking up.<br/><br/>6. another nice thing is when the GM/facilitator/organiser/whatnot gives you a "lines/veils" talk and then establishes some of them him/herself right off the bat. This makes sure the game doesn't turn into a game of chicken, where you agree at the start that yeah, everyone can say "stop"... but then you're actually afraid to voice your desire to stop, because you might spoil other's fun/get laughed at/not treated seriously/whatnot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353018/#Comment_353018" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T07:03:28+00:00" title="January  3, 2012  7:03AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2012 7:17AM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jackson, I was sparked by your "shitting on" and "self-flagellation" comments, but I wasn't writing a response to them, per se. I was offering my position, which is that there's a spectrum there. As you say, it's not binary. So we seem to agree there, which is great.<br/><br/>As for what constitutes a better idea, I could have said more about that, you're right. (I was trying to keep my post short enough to be read, rather than skipped over, so I cut a lot.) My presumption is that either the group reaches consensus about great ideas (it happens sometimes!) or the controlling player has veto power and final say over what his/her character does\u2014including when he/she has solicited a list of options cooked up by the rest of the players. I'd hope that all other players <i>respect</i> that individual authority and I strive to make it happen.<br/><br/>Go back, maybe, and note how, in my example, the initial player opens up the discussion about new ideas for his character's actions. No one's stomping on anyone else, no one's being domineering. If it sounded like I was pro-stomping or pro-domineering, then I somehow got across exactly the wrong message. (Again, my attempt to write in the brief, show-don't-tell style of other Story Gamers I admire seems to have bitten me.)<br/><br/>Everything else I've tried to write in response to your post is too defensive, on my part, so I've cut it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>To make this post of mine more contributive to the thread, though, let me build out two questions and a thesis, which this exchange has me thinking about now:<br/><br/><b>Question: What is respect at the game table and how do you show it?<br/><br/>Question: How does respect interact with trust?<br/><br/>Thesis: Clarity is important but the assumption of clarity is dangerous.

"Don't be a dick" - everyone knows not to do this, except when they don't - and if they don't, then the rule ain't gonna be much help.

Which might seem funny, 'cause it's there for people to feel safe by, but that's just how it is.<br/><br/>So, first we say "this is the veil" and explain what it is.<br/>Then, immediately after, we give an example. I mean you do, you, the person teaching it. I always say "F'rex, if you were to name this minor character catherine, i could say, 'uh, i'm gonna veil the name catherine. Can you name her something else?"<br/>And then step three is the final one: As part of your setup, you've got a co-hort. You perform a scripted thing in play, like, say, you describe breaking a guy's hand when he mouthed you off. And i, your co-hort, say, "uh, i'm gonna veil the whole breaking-his-hand thing. Can we avoid being cruel in our violence, please?" This is vital because it makes the space safe to use the veil in. People are already using the veil! Now everyone can use it!<br/><br/>Or am i missing something?

I've had a lot of success providing physical cues to indicate discomfort as a compromise between shutting down and directly voicing that discomfort. <br/><br/>I draw a large red X on an index card. I show the card to everyone and then put it where anyone can reach. I tell everyone: "If something makes you uncomfortable, lift up this card and make sure I see it. We'll then edit out any uncomfortable content from the game, no questions asked, no explanations needed, and simply move on." Sometimes we'll write the uncomfortable content on the card. We once wrote "no hurting animals" (usually in a different color than the large red X).<br/><br/>The X card isn't just for the players but also the GM (if there is one). I probably use it more than anyone else!<br/><br/>If the X card is used more than 3 times by the same person, I'll call for a break and talk to them privately and re-asses the social dynamic. Generally I'll ask neutral questions to minimize influencing their answers as well as sitting beside them (as opposed to directly opposite) and a bit lower than their eye level with my body gesture open to make them feel more comfortable (adjusting to individuals as needed). I've found speaking first as a group to be problematic. When a person who is feeling uneasy has 5 pairs of eyes staring at them while they voice their discomfort, it can make them feel defensive and anxious. <br/><br/>Just having the X card on the table, even if never used, can help alleviate tension. <br/><br/>This has worked better than listing lines and veils before game begins. I've had a person say, "I don't want rape in the game" and then to my utter shock, that same person raped an NPC (what they really meant is I don't want my character to be raped but I don't have problem with rape). What we say isn't always what we do or mean so I prefer more real time mechanisms for dealing with problems as they occur. That said, I have a few techniques that have improved the odds of success of pre-game lines and veil conversations. <br/><br/>Although I favor trigger avoidance over self-expression, I've found that all of the above can help make someone feel more comfortable with self-expression because they know that if their contributions bother someone else, the other person has a clear method to communicate those issues immediately. So they don't have to worry as much about what they say, and instead focus on self-expression. Where in situations where it is unclear what will offend who, or unclear if you've already offended someone, that can cause people to overly restrain their self-expression. <br/><br/>I'm eager to experiment with more techniques and to learn as much as possible. Especially because I love playing with a wide array of people and I enjoy the challenge of difficult subjects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355570/#Comment_355570" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T17:29:37+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  5:29PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me personally, a safe space is one without harsh judgment on the quality of one's contribution.

Can you name her something else?"<br/>And then step three is the final one: As part of your setup, you've got a co-hort. You perform a scripted thing in play, like, say, you describe breaking a guy's hand when he mouthed you off. And i, your co-hort, say, "uh, i'm gonna veil the whole breaking-his-hand thing. Can we avoid being cruel in our violence, please?" This is vital because it makes the space safe to use the veil in. People are already using the veil! Now everyone can use it!</blockquote>\nThat's weird, I've used the veil like twice in my life and once was to veil the name Catherine. Seriously.

They all looked a bit startled at first, but 30 seconds in they were all laughing and their body language had relaxed.  I think I'll keep doing that.  (I totally made someone cry!  In a good way!  (I checked after the game.))<br/><br/>I run larps, and I'll just about always define touching rules (shoulders, arms and hands) and tell people that they can always timeout and take a break.  They hardly ever do, but I think that knowing they can makes them feel a bit safer with each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355686/#Comment_355686" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T06:27:47+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  6:27AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2012 6:28AM by jenskot.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Have you considered adopting techniques from environments where safe spaces are required?

I've had family who've been raped or assaulted, who are trigger sensitive, and frequent support groups. For me, the challenge has been condensing the techniques so that explaining and using them doesn't take too much time when you are playing for less than 4 hours with strangers. Additionally, some of the techniques used can be fairly overt and might make people uncomfortable in a normal gaming setting, especially a convention. I've been experimenting with compromises but I have a long way to go!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355691/#Comment_355691" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T06:49:41+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  6:49AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a <b>Creating Safe Space Toolkit for GLBTQ Youth</b> that my friend who's a counselor recommends: <a href="http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/storage/advfy/documents/safespace.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF Download</a><br/><br/>It's GLBTQ specific but there is a lot of general useful information as well. <br/><br/>In addition to safe space techniques, conflict resolution skills are very useful to help maintain safe spaces. But beyond techniques, <b>it starts with you</b>. Changing how you think will affect how you communicate and affect how people react to you. <br/><br/>Simple thing like being direct but gentle and respectful. Lean towards empathy and warmth. Have integrity and be consistent. Align what your thinking, saying, and physically communicating to build trust. Don't assume you know the the truth, what is true for you may not be true for others. Don't strive for people to agree with you, accept disagreement or alternate perspectives. Don't invalidate other people's experiences because they don't match your own. Take responsibility for your actions. Keep in mind your culture isn't universal. And before speaking, listen first, ask for clarification if anything is unclear, confirm you understand what is being said, and then voice your opinions. <br/><br/>It's tricky!

I used to have a very pointed lines and veils discussion, during which I'd try to set the tone by offering my own, before play. Most of the time no one would offer anything, and all of the time it seemed to spook people in an unproductive way.<br/><br/>What this evolved into is a much looser approach. What I generally do now is say "If this were a movie, what would we rate it?" Usually it is an R. Then: "If we drift into territory you aren't cool with, for any reason, feel free to call for a break. We can talk about it or not, sort it out or black it out, retcon, whatever." This more casual engagement with safety seems to work well - I have had people (including myself) call for a time out to adjust the game. Interestingly, the "take a break" piece is often omitted - given permission and agency people usually just say "no, wait a minute, that's not cool" and we adjust on the fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355710/#Comment_355710" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T08:47:53+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  8:47AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I draw a large red X on an index card.

Any time I might want to raise such an exception, I have to consider whether explaining a particular issue (and convincing others that I'm not "oversensitive", "hysterical" or "politically correct" to raise it) is a battle I have strength for.
