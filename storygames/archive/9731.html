If I really didn't think it was an RPG I'd have said so. To me it smells more like what I'd call a group storytelling game. <br/><br/>The distinction I generally make between the two is that in the latter, any player may take a direct control over any character, whereas in the former a character is generally considered to be the property of a single player. Not that you can't roleplay somebody elses' character for them, but that's the point where the definition starts to get a bit hazy for me. One player controlling more than one character, that's fine, GM's do it all the time. More than one player playing a single character... unless there's some very clear reason for it (i.e. the players are all voices in a schizophrenic character's head) that's where it starts to break down for me. Without reading the rules (and preferably playing the game) I couldn't give a precise judgement on which category I'd like to place it in.<br/><br/>In any case, neither type of game is necessarily bad, I just like to keep them in separate categories in my own personal classification system. But perhaps someone who's read/played the game can clear that up for me?<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216427/#Comment_216427" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T16:56:44+00:00" title="July  4, 2009  4:56PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2009 5:08PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's actually a very reasonable question. I've got pages of design notes under the header "Is Microscope a game?"<br/><br/>As it turned out, it is. It's isn't group storytelling, because after setup you almost never make decisions as a group.<br/><br/>Different players have creative control at different times (and to different degrees). Different players can control the same character in different scenes (you were the space pope last scene, but I want to play him now) or they can use game mechanics to take control during a scene and impose their creative will (you were playing the space pope, but I declare he really thinks this, so he does -- now carry on). Or they can use their creative authority outside scenes to do very big things to characters (the space pope? oh yeah this is the event where he's assassinated).<br/><br/>When it's your turn you add what you want (and which you have the authority to create, which is tons). You don't negotiate your creative contribution.<br/><br/>So yes, definitely a game, definitely an RPG.<br/><br/>ADDENDUM:<br/><br/>The other part of the picture is the process of choosing what parts of other people's creativity you want to build on and run with. Those two elements combined is what makes Microscope work, and makes the end result absolutely feel like a joint creation, because it really is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
