If you're saying "Don't read the card entries until you have it as a companion or item or you are using it as an item", say that, but you've got to explain what a companion or item is first.<br/><br/>As it is, I'm rather confused, so I skip through that bit, hoping you'll explain what's going on later.<br/><br/>Still reading. Very confused. Very hard to work out instructions like "If a card tells you you must do something..." without knowing what sort of thing it might ask me to do (jump up and down? Tear the card up? Put it in a pile somewhere?).<br/><br/>I'm now at the bit where it says "To recap", but I can't actually remember the instructions telling me the stuff you are recapping. I am confused.

I, um, guess I'm on another whirlwind journey of delirium where visions dance before my eyes that I cannot touch." It wasn't. . .bad, exactly, it just watered down the narrative. The Merchant King posed another problem--the Mirrors and passageways cycle such that they'll ensnare different cards each time, but the King cycles such that the same cards follow him each time, and each time he adds another card to his wares. As it happens the 3 or 4 cards following him were Face cards, which are near-impossible to acquire since you need to trade an equal-value card. So a particular card that I needed to acquire another card to unlock the way to particular location was basically OFF LIMITS as soon as the King ensnared it.<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>Another awkward feature (though maybe intentionally so!): it's really hard to hold on to an item long enough to use it for its intended purpose. they're always getting stolen, or else you need/want to discard them for another, or what have you. It was just another factor, like the recurring mirrors and such, which serve to draw the game out, by means of delaying success/resolution. Which is a neat feature to have, but it got repetitive after awhile. Again, the more often something happened, the harder it was to "make sense of" its meaning in the dream.<br/><br/>It's an interesting design concern, because one of the Smoke Dream's inspirations, the computer text or graphical adventure, does rely on puzzle-solving with repeated stymieing of solutions, and lots of trial and error. And in the context of a dream, everything is ephemeral and all elements can disappear or shift or transform at any time. But a dream also has the quality of the portentous, so the more it mutates, the harder it is to draw meaning or significance out of it.</i><br/><br/>I'll also echo that the instructions were a mite confusing, though I'm not sure I agree on all points above. For instance, I'd certainly make sure a big important restriction like DO NOT PEEK AT THE CARD ENTRIES is up front with flashing lights, because if it's buried in, like, step 7, then people might piss it. Er, miss it.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241061/#Comment_241061" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T09:46:17+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  9:46AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah!

I expected poetry and dreamspace. (a play experience like Adrift, or Love Nothing.)<br/><br/>Instead, I got something that felt like it paid homage to old-school text adventures, where I GET ROPE and EXIT N and USE ROPE and YOU CAN'T DO THAT HERE and EXIT E and "There's a pond here, with fish. If only you could catch one..." and "Oh shit, I need the fishing rod. I think that was three moves west and two moves south" and EXIT W EXIT S EXIT W EXIT S EXIT W and GET FISHING ROD and YOU HAVE A FISHING ROD.<br/><br/>For the player who isn't interested in mental gymnastics (ie, me), there's a lot of cycling through cards without considering the story they create, and only pausing to imagine <i>the dream</i> at certain junctures.<br/><br/>Like this: Hall of mirrors (count six cards, put on bottom of deck), Axe (don't want it, move on), Heart (pick up, drop), Swarthy Cousin (take as companion), Witch of Brass... "Oh, so moments after I encounter a brave adventurer, the witch sets in on the two of us!"<br/><br/>In that example, you'll see, I interface with several cards without even considering their impact on "the dream".<br/>I don't imagine wandering through a hall of mirrors, and then emerging at its exit and nearly stumbling over an axe, kicking it out of my path and continuing on... suddenly hearing the pulse of my heart, hiding in some reeds just over there.<br/><br/>I just game those cards, and wait till I get to a point where imagining the inherent story (a.) makes sense, and (b.) will produce meaningful results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241538/#Comment_241538" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-11T19:30:25+00:00" title="November 11, 2009  7:30PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I played, I wrote down the cards as I played them and made notes.

It's just not the enjoyment I thought I was promised.<br/><br/>The Smoke Dream satisfies the same itch for me that character burning in BW does, or that building an army list in Warhammer does. It's a min/maxing kind of fun, with poetry thrown in there. I enjoy rigging the deck, which turns out to be the primary activity that goes on when I sit down to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241809/#Comment_241809" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T01:01:35+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  1:01AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, what does "rigging the deck" mean? <br/><br/>Is that a euphemism?

So i'm going to just do some bullets that i think might be helpful to you as you move forward:<br/><br/>\u2022 Treat your reader like they are reasonably intelligent but have somehow never played any game ever. Simple, short sentences. Hand hold, but don't patronize. When Henson was working on Sesame Street i think he said "our audience may be short, be we shouldn't ever play down to them." This is a game that NORMAL PEOPLE WHO DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT D&amp;D COULD PLAY. Embrace that, and cater to it.<br/><br/>\u2022 One rule per sentence. <br/><br/>\u2022 Repeat important rules and concepts. Consider telling your reader what you are going to say, then say it, then tell them what you said. <br/><br/>\u2022 Don't worry about people cheating. Cheating is great. The world would simply stop spinning if folks stopped cheating. Embrace deck stacking and reading ahead as an emergent behavior. People want to look under the hood, you can advise against it, but don't scold them for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241895/#Comment_241895" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T14:20:23+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  2:20PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2009 2:20PM by John_Powell.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My number one complaint is that with a wife, two daughters, a geriatric dog and a geriatric cat, I never have enough alone time to play Smoke Dream.

That's a sweet Henson quote. All of your points will be incorporated absolutely.

And besides, he gave me some really good points.<br/><br/>it's funny to look back at the rules text and think "how did i ever think this was clear? this totally reads like an ancient d&amp;d manual. so much is assumed." so yeah, i'm stoked to not restrict my audience to D&amp;D carers-abouters.<br/><br/>thanks again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
