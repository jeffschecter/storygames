Playtesting so far, has demonstrated Coming of Age consistently produces low prep, intensely fun play, ranging from the very silly to the serious. While the setting changes, the underlying story is what remains the same, the Coming of Age tale, where the player's characters discover and achieve their destiny in the face of outside antagonists, and inspite of their own internal flaws. <br/><br/>An actual play example can be found <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23870.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <br/><br/>Coming of Age often seems strange compared to its brethren, refining a RPG to a core of what playtesting has indicated is a highly functional system. This translates to flexibility, in setting, tone, and characters, giving significant replayability. <br/><br/>I'd appreciate feedback and (of course) additional playtesting.

Combined with the descriptive authority on the outcomes and the ability to spend story points at any time (on other player's turns, before your action, or as you resolve it), what a player roleplays sets the situation for the next player's turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven the quality of roleplaying is important, as it influences the social elements of the game: buy-in on antagonist dice and "I'd like to hear more" uses of story points. <br/>\n<br/>\nIndeed, I'd argue that one's roleplaying has at least as much influence on the story than in most RPGs I've seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this seems to fly in the face of the common underlying story, but there is a big difference between knowing generally what is going to happen, and knowing how and why. You develop the destiny of your character when you create it, but you only discover how and why it is achieved by playing. <br/>\n<br/>\n  - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76923/#Comment_76923" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T09:30:39+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  9:30AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That part sounds, on the surface, like shock:.  I suppose that technically, a shock: protagonist's story goals (or whatever they're called, I don't have the book nearby) could happen or not happen, but they have happened the vast majority of times that I've seen the game played, which makes them something like a declared destiny, but they hardly act as spoilers for the diverting play and story that ensues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76929/#Comment_76929" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T10:42:40+00:00" title="June 21, 2007 10:42AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nick,<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a significant difference between the shock: goals, which are things that are challenged and conclude play by either being met or failed, and the Coming of Age titles. Titles are intentionally vague, and may not be achieved in the course of the game, per se, but there is no question that they will become true, during or after the events of the story. A great deal of fun derives from the discovery of what the title actually means, not the question of its achievement. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, in the playtest I linked to above, my character had the title Hero of Koarg's Den, which I wrote as a generic idea. Over the course of the story, the castle where events occured retro-actively became Koarg's Den, as my character ended up defeating the demonic foe in the end, using that title. <br/>\n<br/>\nHad different antagonist dice been purchased, different descriptions used, and different outcomes of actions occured, then perhaps the story we saw would have been how she became Mother of Princes or Captain of the West Marches. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough perhaps the most interesting thing about Coming of Age is how the social elements seem to bring together the otherwise disparate threads of each character into a cohesive story. This sometimes even happens in spite of the player's mood. It doesn't seem to require the players to buy into each other's characters at first. Instead, that buy-in happens over the course of the game. I've seen groups go from intentionally trying to break the game to almost continual laughter over the story they were creating together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
