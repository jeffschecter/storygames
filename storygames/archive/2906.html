Or, if you look at DitV, Dogs works best when everyone has tons and tons of dice to share, but is passably functional if you just have a very small number and a pad of paper to keep track of things.

I can only speak as a consumer (having not taken the "big step" of publishing my own game yet) and as an interested party to your game (go team Unicron), so take my advice with a grain of salt:<br/><br/>If a game requires props I am much less likely to buy it. This is doubly true if I am unfamiliar with the game in question (since most of my "impulse" RPG purchases these days come in the form of PDFs). An added complication, from a business perspective, is that obtaining supplies of beads and cords will most likely require some up-front capital on your part.<br/><br/>With that being said in a game like BW,BR the props add so much to the general feel of the game that I can't see playing without it. <br/><br/>So, here is my suggestion: get the rules out there first (in PDF or printed form) with instructions for making and obtaining the 'props' required (along with some suggestions on easy to find alternatives). Once people get interested in the game, sound some of your customers out on the prospect. If it seems like there is some interest, make a limited set of 'props' easily purchasable through your website... and, depending on the way that you are doing publishing add in the package deal at that point (obviously at a little bit of a discount).<br/><br/>Neglect the previous bit of advice if you are going to be selling this at conventions. In a convention scenario I would have a couple of "prop" sets on hand to sell as a set with the game. I think that it will help draw interest (you will need a couple for your demos anyway).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65949/#Comment_65949" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T21:54:52+00:00" title="April 28, 2007  9:54PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In general, I'd be willing to pay more for game+props than for the game alone.

several books on teaching yourself how to juggle.  Of the books available, I'd pick up the book that comes with the three juggling balls.<br/><br/>Your game has weird stuff that I need to purchase in order to play your game.  Chances are, I won't be able to get the weird stuff in the store where I purchased your game.  D&amp;D used to come in a box that contained dice. Now you've got to purchase the dice separately, but they're in the same store as the books.  Some miniature wargames come with rules and minis in the same box; those that don't probably have miniatures to purchase in the same store as the rulebook.  So yeah, if I came across your game and I've got to go someplace else to get the weird stuff needed to play your game, I'm not getting your game.<br/><br/>As a consumer, those extra bits are things that are supposed to come with the game.  If other games that are of the same type are going for a set price -- let's assume $25 -- your game should go for $25.  Look at board games.  A game with a board, dice, player tokens, and four sheets of counters can go for the same amount as a board game with a board, two dozen action tokens, dozens of meeples, sixty resource cubes, a 110 card deck of bridge sized cards, and a 55 card deck of smaller sized cards.  That first game is far cheaper to produce than the second game, but they both might retail for $45.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66034/#Comment_66034" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T19:40:43+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  7:40PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>Maybe my question should be "would you buy a game if it said 'some assembly required -- you have to go shopping at Wal-Mart or Michael's'?'" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>That's the Cheapass Games model, and it works for them. ;-)<br/><br/>(And then later they sell you a deluxe edition with prettier content and more stuff.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66039/#Comment_66039" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T20:52:10+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  8:52PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the game is that fun, I will pay a lot for it.

But again, that's only because I played it, see that it works, it's fun, and hot. I could gather all the above supplies myself, and probably already have them: Poker chips in 4 different colors, A 1d6 to replicate the color cube, and just buy the game in PDF format.  I might have done that to save money, if I weren't totally in love with this game.<br/><br/>Put together the pieces, and sell it as a package, and some people will buy it no matter the price. Of course, a LOT of people will buy it if the game is really that good, and there's a lot of people who will back up that fact.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66040/#Comment_66040" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T21:09:01+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  9:09PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kynn, I think it comes down to whether your game is going to be played primarily by gamers or non-gamers.
