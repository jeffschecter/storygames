Included here are our thoughts on where some of that patented knee-jerk nerd defensiveness may be coming from, how to address issues of exclusion in the context of PAX (boycott cons? or get political at them?), and River\u2019s dramatic reading of Gabe\u2019s apology itself.<br/><br/>We also talk through some happy stuff \u2013 fond reminiscence about the original Total Recall, trepidation about World War Z, true excitement for The Conjuring and GoPlay NW, and some neat games \u2013 The Upgrade and Seven Grand Steps.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.selfcriticalhits.com/?p=325" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Self-Critical Hits 039 - Damn it, Nerd Culture</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
