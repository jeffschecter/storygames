Consider a game of cops and robbers. No one really thinks that the kid playing the robber is approving or being predisposed to being a robber by playing the robber. <br/><br/>On the pro side, when when we play, we have a chance to do something outside ourselves, that may have a lasting impact on ourselfs. Plato took this to the extreme in wanting to ban certain plays and poets about the gods acting naughty because it serves at the very least as an example and at worst as a kind of training program for that sort of behaviour. <br/><br/>I find it really interesting that a lot (or at least it seems to me ) of people are jumping on this ethical stance for play, because it seems to me to come from a very content creator / publisher / feminist (let me explain that last one a bit, it remind me of the argument over whether consuming porn is ethical even if the porn itself is made ethically, etc,etc) that doesn't really jive with what I think of it as. Even the bits about porn seem about as different from play as night and day to me, althought I'm sure you can make an argument about playing with yourself ... <br/><br/>I hope I get some responces, cock talk optional                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227409/#Comment_227409" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T21:50:15+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  9:50PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2009 9:50PM by noclue.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Question: Is there any choice a person can make that does not have an ethical dimension to it?

Ethical choice is just one of them.</blockquote>\nLuke -- can you provide examples of "decision options" that are not examples of "ethical choice"? It would help to get a handle on what precisely you think an ethical choice is if we got a clearer idea of what it is not.<br/><br/>Are you limiting the domain of a persona's ethical choices to those that explore questions of "social right and wrong" within the play narrative? Or are you also admitting persona choices that hinge simply on value judgements of what might produce more or less positive outcomes for the persona within the play narrative?<br/><br/>For example, here's a scenario: in a game of Diplomacy, I'm playing France. Press can be open to everyone and private, power to power, but none of the players know the real-world identity of other players. It's turn 6. For the past four turns, I have been carefully cultivating an alliance with Italy, and have done so based pretty solidly on the fact that I convinced Italy that German had lied to Italy in turn one (when in fact the lie was carefully planned by both Germany and me, as France). The time has come to bring the next big strategic plan to a head, requiring me to stab Italy, so that Germany and I can proceed to apply further pressure to Austria and Turkey who seem to be working together. Just before I have to submit orders for the upcoming turn, I receive press from Italy that's lengthy and thoughtful; it clearly indicates that Italy has assessed the situation, determined that chances are high that s/he is being set up by an FG alliance, and proposes that I turn double-agent on G and work with Italy in the face of the oncoming Austro-Turkish menace. Italy points out the cooperation that we've had to this point (duplicitous or not, it was cooperation), and the fact that our strategy to this point was more or less sound, and the fact that Germany him/herself is vulnerable to a stab in the upcoming turn.<br/><br/>Are my choices about (a) what press to send back to Italy, and Germany, and (b) what orders to submit in the upcoming turns, "ethical choices" as you term them? Why or why not?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227472/#Comment_227472" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T05:53:43+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  5:53AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2009 5:54AM by viktor_haag.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>deleted as duplicate</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227481/#Comment_227481" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T06:37:34+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  6:37AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really think the decision to either wear red or wear blue has NO ethical dimension. Your breathe in and breathe out question is a bit of a hidden dragon because really what your talking about is suicide, which is pretty well recognized as an ethical topic. <br/><br/>I'm trying to suss out how people can say that all the decisions we make are ethical, it just does not ring true to me. It seems like someone (a lot of people, some , a few) jump from Luke's position, to No Clue's position and it really kind of boggles me. <br/><br/>As for luke's position, I would think that if play was ethical even only partly or when we turn play to the subject matter (which<br/> can happen and does happen) that it would still have to be free of ethics. Play does provide that safe space to explore the subject matter, but it seems to me like that safe space exists because of the lack of ethical connotation. I mean if Play in this Ethical sense was infact ethical, it still seems to require no robbers in our game of cops and robbers because well to do so would be unethical. <br/><br/>Either way thank you for comments, I appreciate the effort to defend your views for while I have tried to be fair and equal to each side, I obviously have my points of view. <br/><br/>L<br/><br/>As for the Diplomacy, its a much better example than most. Its a Play Ethical situation (which is fun, Diplomacy games are often Riotous exactly because of the unethical behaviour). But ultimately I doubt your advocating that actual nations should be run like a game of Diplomacy (althought they sometimes are) . Furthermore if someguy decides to play Douchebag germany, I really doubt you would get put out or condemn such actions in real life.<br/><br/>I surpose part of what makes me so damn sure that play is not ethical is that ethical decisions when presented in a simular or same context ought to be generizible. Either its wrong to kill someone or its not, and while there can be exceptions (self defence) the basic generalization sticks for the most part. Play does not seem generalised in part because it often requires the opposite to be played (the robber in cops and robbers ) which if the play itself was ethical, should not be done it seems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227489/#Comment_227489" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T07:03:59+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  7:03AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Viktor, <br/>You didn't read any of my posts in that other thread, did you? I'm feeling unusually charitable, so here goes:<br/><br/>For me, ethical includes the normative right and wrong mixed with the more complicated nuances of applied ethics. <br/><br/>While Ralph comes close to maintaining that all decisions in an RPG are ethical (due to, I think, the creation of a fictional narrative in which we identify with the characters) I think we can also safely say there are other decisions going on: strategic, tactical, aesthetic (as GB Steve pointed out) and personal.<br/><br/>I"m going to get in trouble for defining these because you're all going to quibble with my terms/definitions rather than trying to actually understand what I'm saying, but here goes:<br/>Strategic -- playing the game based on mechanical properties over multiple instances of play.<br/>Tactical -- optimizing mechanical play within a single instance of play.<br/>Aesthetic -- appealing to genre or doing what's cool, despite other mitigating factors.<br/>Personal -- recognizing that the other players at the table have needs/wants/preferences and addressing them over any other consideration.<br/><br/>I think those four elemental decisions can be found in most game play. <br/><br/>In Starcraft:<br/>I can ramp up harvesting early, and tell my allies to go zealot while I rapidly tech up.<br/>I can use a queen to neutralize your templar before I send in my guardians.<br/>I can choose to build an army of firebats in Starcraft merely because it's cool. Got a light? (x48!!!)<br/>I can choose to pull back from an attack and let your base survive because I want the game to go on longer or because you're screaming and frothing from the next room and have stated, "If you nuke me again, I will murder you." Sorry dude. It's just a game! ;-)<br/><br/>You know what I can't do <i>in</i> Starcraft? I can't make an ethical decision -- AT ALL. There's no right and wrong in Starcraft. There's only winning or losing. When I sacrifice a small band of marines in a crystal patch to act as a distraction (and die), I am not weighing their needs against the needs of the base. There is no gut wrenching decision, tearful good byes or tragic ending for them. I merely made a tactical (or strategic, depending on the situation in the game) decision.<br/><br/>It's a magical thing that when we play that game with so much blood and carnage, there are no ethical decisions contained within. Perhaps sitting down to play games about simulated war is an ethical decision. The decision to cheat in a game is certainly ethical. But both of those examples are above and beyond the act of game play itself.<br/><br/>The magic of a roleplaying game is that space for an engaging, gripping ethical decision DOES exist right in the fundamental framework of the game. In a roleplaying game, giving the order to leave your friends behind because you need that dropship NOW is powerful and affecting -- there's situation, context, fiction, emotion and, ultimately, narrative. Your decision resulted in the death of one or more of your friends. You bastard! How could you?! To get that final holy grail of narrative, you start us off with an ethical decision.<br/><br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227519/#Comment_227519" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T08:37:28+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  8:37AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luke, I get all that stuff, and I think most everyone else does too.

Perhaps I missed a previous post where you were this clear at explaining the terms you were using. If so, that's on me for not reading it and understanding it.<br/><br/>I don't know much about Starcraft (neither the computer game, nor the boardgame), so all I can say on your example is that I think I see what point you're making.\n<blockquote>The magic of a roleplaying game is that space for an engaging, gripping ethical decision DOES exist right in the fundamental framework of the game. In a roleplaying game, giving the order to leave your friends behind because you need that dropship NOW is powerful and affecting -- there's situation, context, fiction, emotion and, ultimately, narrative. Your decision resulted in the death of one or more of your friends. You bastard! How could you?! To get that final holy grail of narrative, you start us off with an ethical decision.</blockquote>\nI see your point, and I don't disagree that a great deal of the fun in rolegaming comes out of exploring what you're terming ethical choice within the context of the developing narrative. However, I'm also not (still) convinced that these kinds of ethical choices don't appear in other games that we clearly (as a community) <i>don't</i> particularly see as rolegames. In your example in the above quote, you highlight a decision to "leave your friends behind because you need that dropship NOW" as a powerful, affecting (and ethical?) choice that your persona is compelled to make. I see that, and acknowledge your point.<br/><br/>However, I also don't see all that much material difference between that very choice you highlight in your example, and the choice that my Diplomacy persona must make about whether to betray his/her ally, the inevitability of that choice, the consequences of that choice (or the consequences of not making it or refusing to make it), within the context of the ongoing narrative that tells the tale of the ongoing Diplomacy game.<br/><br/>I grant that rolegaming highlights these ethical choices (in some play styles) as central to the game's purpose in and of themselves, rather than mere by-product. What I don't grant is that these choices, as you've determined them (choices that can be examined on the axis of right/wrong within the social context of the game's narrative), are unique to rolegames in particular.<br/><br/>At this point, I don't see all that much point in pursuing the point further unless you feel it's productive. From my perspective, you seem to have persuasively made your point that (a) you think that ethical choice is central to what you see as roleplaying, and (b) such choices are vital to what you feel makes rolegamig unique and positive and fun. That's fine with me. I just get a bit tetchy when you seem to think this is an exclusive attribute that defines the hobby, because I still don't see that, particularly.<br/><br/>Agree to disagree, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227587/#Comment_227587" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T11:08:29+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 11:08AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Burr</cite>Maybe if we were manipulating real situations or planning to do so, but instead we're merely creating fiction.

Of course, you're decision to wear clothing at all is fraught with ethical considerations. The decision to consume resources to purchase either red or blue clothing is also an ethical choice. Where were the red anb blue dyes produced to create the clothes? The decision not to check on the worker conditions at the factories that produced the red shirt and the blue shirt and then use that information in your decision is itself an ethical choice (not saying you should do these things, of course).<br/><br/>To me the question is not whether play is ethical, it is about how much should our decisions about what, when and how we choose to play be guided by ethical concerns. Is it a fictional playground where anything goes as long as its in character, or do we have to be concerned about racism, sexism and the like? If so, how much? <br/><br/>And as with any entertainment, it is not totally free and safe, real life ethical concerns are encountered in playing RPGs just as they are in books, film and music. And opinions will vary as to how much restriction, and how much freedom, is optimal.<br/><br/>Unless I miss the point of your question, which is possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate" title="mike_the_pirate"><img alt="mike_the_pirate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y4/r_goulet/smalliconmike.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate">mike_the_pirate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227754/#Comment_227754" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T21:10:54+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  9:10PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to respond to the initial question, though I've read through the posts here.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay is a place where you can act without limitations. This is important to developing as a person. Ultimately, you learn the difference between fantasy and reality. I don't think ethics factor into play as much as simple consequences. When I used to play army with my friends, we never considered whether shooting imaginary bad guys was right or wrong (maybe these were just poor people forced to join the evil army because of social and economic issues) because there was no consequence to it. Now diving behind the couch to dodge a grenade made us pause for a moment if a lamp was nearby because if the lamp broke we'd get yelled at. The decision became cause and effect. If I break the lamp, I get yelled at, so maybe I just go for it hoping for the best, or maybe I rework the grenade scenario to avoid the lamp altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nTranslating that to more adult (or teen) forms of play like RPGs, or real-time strategy games, ethics do appear, but not necessarily from the gameplay or the game. I don't think ethics are important in playing D&amp;D (for example) unless a group of players wants to make them so. People may be guided by ethical concerns in games, but how much of those concerns should rule your game table? If you feel particularly strong about sexism in a game, to what extent will you control that element? I don't mean sexism between players, but in-game characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree that all decisions that we make are ethical. If I am deciding whether to sleep for 7 or 8 hours, who runs the risk of being harmed? If I am deciding whether to go to class or not, who runs the risk of being harmed? My grades and my gpa perhaps, but is it an ethical decision when you decide to harm yourself (cutting, and suicide aside)? You don't decide to continue breathing. You can't just hold your breath indefinitely. Reality trumps hypothetical in that case. I think it does a disservice to label all decisions as ethical even the red or blue shirt one. If all decisions are ethical, then no decisions are ethical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227767/#Comment_227767" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T22:38:43+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 10:38PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mike_the_pirate</cite>If all decisions are ethical, then no decisions are ethical.</blockquote>\nI'm not disagreeing with you. I'll take it a step further. If all play is ethical then no play is ethical. And that's essentially my point. Asking if play is ethical is too broadly worded. I can make a case for a universal yes, but it will make ethical behavior somewhat meaningless. On the other  hand, asking if it is ethical for me, a white male to play a black slave in Steel Away Jordan; Or if it is ethical for me to play a chauvinistic knight in the middle ages, or a jingoist out to spread western civilization to the new world. These look to me like ethical considerations. <br/><br/>Your example too of shooting bad guys and dodging hand grenades. I know many folks who don't allow their children to play make believe war or play with pretend guns. My friend had a rule with his kid that they not point toy guns at people, even on TV, until one day his son pointed his gun at a Nazi on TV and shot him. My Jewish friend just shrugged and said, "well, not at people, except Nazis." <br/><br/>These seem like ethical concerns emerging from play. And I think these examples are fundamentally different from what Luke is talking about when he talks about the persona you're playing betraying his fictional comrades, because in that case the victims don't exist and you can truly roleplay those ethical choices and create narrative without consequences. But I'm assuming from the OP's talk of porn and feminism and masturbation, that this is about this other thing, because if its about fictional ethical choices in the game why create a new thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Midnight" title="Justin Midnight"><img alt="Justin Midnight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Midnight">Justin Midnight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227772/#Comment_227772" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T23:00:47+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 11:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is play ethical?

So let me rephrase my question...<br/><br/>You have the choice to go up Blue street or Red street and all the previous harms that have been encountered in the creation of blue and red street have been completely and charitibly discharged to everyone's satisfaction.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that you can play a game of 7 degrees of moral issues, and find something in 7 degrees or less, But I find it really incredulous that you would suggest choosing the colour of shirt you have to wear or street you have to go down, or if you flip a dime or a nickle to be moral issues. Even moral issues ... for you ... (whatever that means, the nature of morals makes the ...for you .... either miopic or just plain a useless defence. I mean really, if all of life is moral, then someone should write a book about how to live it, and make sure to include red shirt vs blue shirt debates, because really I don't think its registering on people what a moral fraught universe we are in (and here I thought lying to nazi's would be the most tedious that morality could get to).</br></br></blockquote>\nAwesome. So, in effect you're saying is play the ethical equivalent of flipping nickels and dimes?<br/><br/>I think you may be derailing your own thread by focusing on minutia rather than my main point, which is the stuff we humans do on a day to day basis has ethical implications. Why is play any different? Yes, you can titrate the example down to the level where the ethical concern is purely philosophical, but you have to go pretty far down on the triviality meter to get there.<br/><br/>I also like Justin's question: Can play be unethical?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227839/#Comment_227839" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T09:39:02+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  9:39AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think roleplaying, at least, can be played in an ethics-neutral way.

This is what differentiates it from ordinary life. If people were trying to be nazi's that would be disturbing and wrong but if people are playing at being nazi's I think it all of a sudden its a lot less disturbing and wrong. (and I'm not just thinking children here, but also fetish play among other things) <br/><br/>I'm not trying to water down the discussion, just trying to see how much of an unknown ethical decision you are trying to push for (which oddly enough makes titrate exactly the right word). You have a very strange ethical point of view without a lot of common bits of ethics in there. Limitations of responcibilty, The Right to do what is legal, The Right to self harm and harm, etc ,etc. I think its a very skewed view, its responcibility all the way down and that I think is ignoring the day day quite a bit. I'm not trying to wash away the ethical concern into the realm of the philosophical but show there is no reasonible ethical concern there. <br/><br/>I also think that perhaps I should have put more emphasis on morality over ethics. A world view always has a ethics but does it always have morality? Not so certainly. I'm not arguing against value judgements (maybe you really like blue) but rather moral judgements because that leaves us in a place where we have to play such and such a way, and we have a fair responcibility to make sure others play in that way, and that I think is rather rubbish. <br/><br/>I hope that clearifies why I started this, Thank you to everyone. I think this topic is finished however. Titrate my ass why dont you. <br/><br/>L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
