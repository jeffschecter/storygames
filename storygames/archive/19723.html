To celebrate this little milestone, I put together a list of all the games I'd played. <br/><br/>Thanks to all the designers, GMs and my fellow players for welcoming me into this awesome world!<br/> <br/>Monsterhearts (20)<br/>Forsooth! (9)<br/>Love in the Time of Seid / Westeros (6)<br/>Microscope (6)<br/>Fiasco (5)<br/>Golden Sky Stories (5)<br/>Ribbon Drive (3)<br/>The Quiet Year (3)<br/>Witch: the Road to Lindisfarne (3)<br/>A Penny for my Thoughts (2)<br/>Bubblegumshoe (2)<br/>Durance (2)<br/>Hillfolk (2)<br/>Kingdom (2)<br/>A Question for Mama<br/>A Taste for Murder<br/>Anarktica<br/>Cthulhu Dark<br/>Cthulhu Pale<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>Don't Rest Your Head<br/>Dread<br/>Dungeon World<br/>Geasa<br/>GxB<br/>Heist<br/>Hot Guys Making Out<br/>Intrepid<br/>Legends Walk<br/>Narrative Pursuits<br/>Nemesis<br/>Odyssey<br/>On Mighty Thews<br/>Our Last Best Hope<br/>Puppetland<br/>Sci-Fi Beta Kappa<br/>Smallville Archipelago<br/>Strata<br/>The Comics Code<br/>The Mountain Witch<br/>The Scream<br/>Timewatch<br/>Trail of Cthulhu<br/>UnAmerican<br/>Vast &amp; Starlit<br/>---<br/>Of course, I can't actually put together a list without having a think about what the data means. First thought... wow, I can't believe I've played that much Monsterhearts (and I've actually played more since then... and we're planning a Monsterhearts special meet for Halloween). <br/><br/>The top 6 or so are actually a little bit deceptive. I've played them so often because I've actively taken them to cons and other events and run them for other people. For example, I've only ever been a regular punter for Microscope once. Every other time I've been facilitating it for others. Likewise that accounts for 3 of the Fiascos, 3 of the GSS, 4 of the Forsooth! and 9 of the Monsterhearts. What this has told me is that, aside from me being comfortable running them, these games all have a hook that has drawn in the random punter curious about rpgs over other games on offer.<br/><br/>Most of my gaming is at London indiemeet and it's clear from this data that I rely on them to expose me to a staggeringly diverse array of games, from which I then pick the ones I want to take to cons and pitch to others. Looking just at games I've played at indiemeet, everything is at 1s or 2s bar Forsooth! (which I've deliberately changed up to look fresh, once as a teenage high school 'Ten Things I Hate About You' style and once using Monsterhearts skins), Monsterhearts (7) and Seid (4).<br/><br/>The number of Seid games at Indiemeet can be lain at the door of one member who loved it so much that he ran it for everybody. That's created both a curiosity from those who've joined after and heard about it from others and also a familiarity from the veterans that has meant that (while they will normally go for something different) they also see Seid is a safe choice if nothing else takes their fancy.<br/><br/>As for Monsterhearts, it's not actually got much play at all at Indiemeet this year (whereas Fiasco, by comparison, has remained an evergreen), but despite this I think there's a fair bit of Monsterhearts enthusiasm pent up. While it's not had one particular advocate within the group as Seid did, it had such a big impact when it first came out that again it's a safe choice. We typically have more game pitches than players to fill them so often games are left unplayed. I've never seen that happen to Monsterhearts though.<br/><br/>Looking through the list, there are a whole bunch of games listed as one-offs that I've only not played more often because of lack of opportunity: Dread, GxB, Narrative Pursuits, The Mountain Witch, Vast &amp; Starlit. I want to get more games in of GSS as well, but I'm still having a few mechanical problems with it that I need to resolve.<br/><br/>As well as those, there's all the rpgs on my shelf that I have never played (and I've just backed another one). When will there be time?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437865/#Comment_437865" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T01:48:59+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  1:48AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an amazing list!
