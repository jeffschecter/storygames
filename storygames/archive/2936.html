Don and Joanna made up "trailer trash" characters and Matt was a high-roller from the strip. The money they were working for meant an escape from nowheresville and a way out of gambling debts. Character creation went smoothly and once the players were comfortable with the rhythm of building conflicts to gain tools and narrating the outcome of the conflicts we moved along at a good pace.<br/><br/> What I observed in the early game was some confusion about what constituted an expensive, and therefore risky, conflict vs. a cakewalk with little gain. I may need to goad that along, maybe with a minimum value? Or just better suggestions. After all, if eventual players spend too much time nickel and diming they're going to run out of time to surprise their enemy.<br/><br/>Throughout play I found that though I had better balanced the advantages of the players to the restrictions of the GM, there were still some exploits that kept me from being a true threat. Specifically, the black tokens. The GM is meant to use these to gain control of a conflict and throw some extra points in on his side. The problem is that he can only spend one or two at a time. Once the players realized this, they flooded me with black tokens, taking the advantages they gain from the exchange and sticking me with more tokens than I could possibly use. The black tokens will be completely re-tooled to make them more dangerous. The goal is for players to dread the black tokens so that they try to limit the GM's access and use their temporary advantage only in dire conditions.<br/><br/>Endgame is still sloppy and we slid to a halt. I need to investigate ways to prevent the players using a preparation scene as the kill scene. The kill must be played out, even if the GM's defense is worn down.<br/><br/>Highllights included a scene in which Matt had to get his hands on a very valuable preparation; a bottle of cognac they were intending to use to bribe a native to give them a trained rattler. Since this was a valuable item for their plan, Matt and I had over 100 points each riding on the outcome of this bet. We split our points between how aggressively we attacked each other vs. how cautiously we would defend. I tried a "bluff" by splitting my numbers down the middle thinking he would split heavily to one side or the other. He however, also did an even split, but with two more points in his pool. He beat me by one point on each side and gained the prize without a scratch.<br/><br/>Then Don blew a follow-up and lost the bottle, but c'est la vie.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
