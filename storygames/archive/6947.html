I'm fascinated by the interaction (or frequently lack of!) between the gamer culture and, well, the rest of the people in the world. <br/><br/>For example, Ben Lehman says he's seen little to no negative reaction when he says "it's like D&amp;D" to non-gamers. Meanwhile, Brendan Adkins seems to say he sees it a lot. My experience match Brendans! Which doesn't make Ben wrong, of course. But, it does make Ben less able to confront any problem because he can't see it. And, I think there are lots of Bens here, likely.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have a slightly weird position on this broad topic. It leads to online pissing matches more often than it does to constructive conversations. Please, please help make this one of those constructive ones. <br/><br/>My position is this: I find the culture of gamers personally unsatisfying. I find the activity of playing role-playing games with individual people I know and meet very satisfying.<br/><br/>You can probably see that my position leads to confusion, even hurt, particularly among gamers. Which leads to the pissing matches I mentioned. That's not what I want to discuss, please.<br/><br/>One of the extensions of my position is that I start by assuming the reactions of non-gamers to gamer-dom and its activities are natural, understandable, and human. That is, the burden's on gamers and gamer-dom to remedy the problem, not on regular people are are behaving as they should. OF COURSE this does not mean regular people never fuck up and they're always right. Of course not. But, it's a charitable position to start understanding painful, negative things like: \n<ul><li>You are all nerds and should be outcast socially</li>\n<li>You are fat / smelly / gross</li>\n<li>You are losers who will never get laid</li>\n<li>You are in a cult</li>\n<li>You are going to murder someone</li>\n<li>You're probably on drugs</li>\n<li>You can't tell reality from fantasy and will hurt yourself somehow</li>\n<li>You live in your parents' basement, and this is a shameful thing</li>\n<li>You can't relate to regular people / girls / boys / etc.</li></ul>\nThese and others should sound pretty familar to many of us. They certainly do to me. I've experienced several items here first hand from my own family, let alone friends. One of the only serious conversations I had with my mom growing up was how she was worried I could not distinguish reality from fantasy. I was something like 16 years old, and she was being a frightened, foolish mom.<br/><br/>The list above is the kind of thing that most often get brought up in online discussions when we "analyze the hobby" or whatever. They are <i>real</i> things. People do think this stuff about gamers, for good or ill. (Obviously, mostly for ill.) But, most often, they get dismissed, often defensively so. And, that's pretty understandable given the list of nasty stuff. So, the conversations don't often get far; mainly they just reinforce the circle-the-wagons mentality of gamer-dom and that whole Own-Your-Geek-As-Cool thing that I just don't "get" but seems to work for many people.<br/><br/>But, here are some other things that I don't think get talked about as much. \n<ul><li>What the hell IS this activity? I don't get it. What's all the fuss?</li>\n<li>I don't have time for this. It takes too much investment.</li>\n<li>I can't understand this complex stuff. It's so intimidating and makes me feel dumb!</li>\n<li>They'll never let someone "normal" like me play. Oh well.</li>\n<li>You are too sexist / racist / elistist. Who needs THAT?!?</li>\n<li>What if I do it wrong? They'll think I suck.</li>\n<li>Oh, you mean like World of Warcraft. My girlfriend dated this guy and they broke up because of it. He was addicted.</li>\n<li>Why don't they just go out and live life! This is too boring.</li></ul>\nAlso all real stuff. Again, much of which I've experienced first-hand.<br/><br/>When I look at that list, I start to see non-gamers much less defensively. I see them as people with doubts, fears, envy, passion, curiousity, shame, you name it. I "get" these reactions. They're totally defensible! And, unfortunately, our gamer culture doesn't have especially good answers for most of this.<br/><br/>So, that's what I'd love to see a discussion about. Why do negative reactions surface? What, if anything, is the gamer-culture's reaction to it? Can or should it improve? How? Do you, as a gamer, sympathize with any negative reactions like this (I do, for one).<br/><br/>What else comes to mind about this stuff? I'd love to hear it. <br/><br/>Please, please keep the shit-flinging out of the zen, cool?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154713/#Comment_154713" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T14:09:32+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  2:09PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you personally deal with these questions, Matt?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154718/#Comment_154718" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T14:22:17+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  2:22PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>What the hell IS this activity?

To be fair, many RPGs are complex and time-consuming. Many gaming groups can have their own micro-culture which is extremely intimidating to penetrate. And for many people, 'roleplaying games' mean Final Fantasy and WoW.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that one of the issues might be that we, the gamers, have a tendency to hear something vaguely negative regarding the hobby and view it as one of the first batch of jibes you mentioned, as opposed to the second. As a hobby that has rarely been accepted within the mainstream, we have a sort of siege mentality that sometimes morphs into a sort of converting zeal.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at it this way - imagine Golf? I have some pretty negative feelings about golf (weird, expensive, elitist, time consuming, too many rules, poncy etc). However, I have never had anyone try to recruit me into playing golf, attempt to design a 'beginners' gold game to help me realise my love of the game, challenged my bias against golf or debated the issues behind my assumptions. However, when it comes to gaming, we do all of these things and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do we improve this? Well, I would say 'be true to yourself.'<br/>\n<br/>\nFolks, we sit around for hours at a time, week in-week out, pretending to be elves and dwarves. Our standard games have rule books like small encyclopedias with, in some cases, literally 100s of different rules and permutations. We play games that can last years. We have a culture riddled with jargon and unique terminology. All of these things are true and its pretty hard to escape them as you become involved in the hobby.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like everyone will not play golf, not everyone will roleplay. Just like I cannot see the attraction of following a little white ball around a trail of grass, some people cannot see the attraction of acting out the adventures of Star Captain Zack Wang. If we stop viewing these as problems - either with roleplaying or us or the person - and just accept that there are different strokes for different folks, we might come across as a little less ... desperate?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now my favourite Gamer-Mother story.  When I first told my now sadly dead Mother that I had just scored a free trip to Wrestlemania off the back of working for a CCG company, she was very pleased. She asked "Is that like that Dungeons and Dragons?". I said that it was, sort of, but I don't really play D&amp;D; anymore. She replied "Oh thats good, I was always a little worried about the demon worship!". Upon further investigation I discovered that she had thought that all the time I had been roleplaying, from around 12-18, I was also a devil worshipper - a one man cult in my little terraced bedroom in a mining village on the Northumberland borders. I asked her why she never stopped me? Her reply? "Well ... you looked like you were having such a good time, I didn't want to interfere!"<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154723/#Comment_154723" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T14:39:53+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  2:39PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2008 2:43PM by Max Higley.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do sympathize with reactions like these.  My experience with gamers (including myself) has shown me a lot of potential reasons why these same perceptions tend to surface frequently.  A lot of wounded people are drawn to roleplaying, and their reactions to others often don't put the best face on the hobby.  Is there anything we can do about that?  No, and yes.  No, because it's not like we can ask people to leave -- not to mention, much of the time, they is us.  But also yes, because we can each deal with our own stuff, and work to react to outsiders intelligently, responsibly, empathetically.<br><br>For a lot of the comments regarding roleplaying as complicated and/or boring, my simple answer is "That's OK.  You're free to like this hobby, or not, which is in no way a reflection of me, or my choice to pursue it."  But it's a tough one to give, especially when you're feeling defensive.  At some point, I realized that the way people react to me is much more a reflection of their state of mind than my actuality.  So I <i>try</i> to let them live in whatever state they want...when I don't get too defensive.<br><br>ETA: Neil's story cracked me up.

Because people snark at everything, absolutely everything under the sun, and the ones that they don't get shot down on are the ones they continue to snark on.

When Matt says that "reactions of non-gamers to gamer-dom and its activities are natural, understandable, and human", he is in my opinion absolutely correct insofar as the natural human reaction to activities that are unfamiliar is "eeewww weird".  This is natural and human because it once helped us avoid being eaten by cougars.  Being a neophile requires either aberrant genetics or training.<br><br>So for me the first step in deciding how to react is to reject the thesis that we as the community of gamers (regardless of whether gamers means in context "players of video games", "players of tabletop games", "players of tabletop role playing games", "players of tabletop role playing games with non-traditional mechanics put out by small publisher", etc), are doing anything badwrong.  When you are a member of a small focused community of interest who is not familiar to the mainstream, you must simply assume that most people that learn of your avocation will be initially puzzled, and may have random associations based on their history of interactions with other people they may have perceived as being part of the community you are identified with.  This is true regardless of whether the community is gaming, rat breeding, or morris dancing (to name a few).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154726/#Comment_154726" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T14:42:05+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  2:42PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2008 2:42PM by Mcdaldno.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (x-posted with Neil Gow, everyone after him, and even the person who posted just after me.

Specifically, there is an absence of social judgment/shaming where one would normally see it. But there isn't really a replacement mechanism, there's just a hole in the process of normal social interactions.<br><br>So, when Smelly Jim and Boring Todd come to the table... well, gamers have to love each other, and we want gaming to be a safe haven for people, and we care about the sanctity of our geeky brotherhood, and we want to end the cycle of bullying violence...<br/><br/>All noble goals. But to simply remove a step in the social interaction chain, without replacing it with something that serves the same purpose, you don't actually solve the problems. Now you have gamer resentment, and gamer negative-self-image, and gamer negative-external-image.<br/><br/>It'd WORK if the gamer culture was that people told Smelly Jim in a non-confrontational way that he needed to shower daily, and gave him tips on grooming. It'd WORK, eventually, if people just shut down boring conversations with Todd but encouraged the exciting ones. If we created a culture of social support, rather than social blindness, I could invest in that culture. But as it stands, we're lacking critical social mechanisms because we've chosen to cast them aside, because we've seen how they can be used as weapons.<br/><br/>Matt, is that at all on target?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154727/#Comment_154727" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T14:42:05+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  2:42PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike -- <br/><br/>Good question. Do you have specific ones you want to know about? <br/><br/>I dealt with my mom by rolling my eyes and saying something like "I KNOW mom. How stupid do you think I am? It doesn't work that way." "Ok, she said quietly. "I just want you to think about that." Which is Mom talk for "You may not know, so I'm giving you guidance anyway." She was, as nearly everyone here knows, just ignorant and off-base. She might as well have said "Matt, that play that you're going to be in at school, I want you to know that you're not actually one of the von Trapp children." Jeez, mom! But, whatever. <br/><br/>I usually do not explain the "what IS it?" question. I say stuff like "Oh, its a kind of Western where everyone builds the story together." And, the unspoken message from BOTH is "We're both slightly uncomfortable or uncertain right now. Let's talk about something else." And we do.<br/><br/>Brian -- <br/><br/>I agree! I mean, on the one hand, it's really, really great that we've got such a unique activity and process that it's hard to relate. On the other hand, rather obviously this is a barrier for communicating outside our sub-culture.

I hadn't thought of it in that way before -- that it's an absence. But, yes, I think you're on target. <br/><br/>I also argue (which you may not agree, and that's cool) that also there <i>is</i> shaming where there <i>shouldn't</i> be. For example, when one questions the hobby's culture! Which is why I padded my orignal post with such requests to let that crap go.

And a possible reason that it's often felt so strongly (the group defensive shaming) is because people don't want to reconcile the two types of shaming. If X and Y MUST get along, but Y and Z don't need to... we need to stop and think about the dynamics going on. That invites inquiry.

I've always been good at math, and now I teach high school math for a living.  Many, many people, including a WHOLE lot of gamers that I know, absolutely hate math and numbers.  They're terrified of them.  I get SO MUCH RESENTMENT from people when I talk about liking math or being good at it or teaching it.  In general I'd say those reactions are worse than the reactions I get when I mention roleplaying.<br/><br/>(As an aside, I've met a lot of other math teachers who aren't particularly enthusiastic about math, which bugs the hell out of me.)<br/><br/>Now, if I meet someone, tell them I'm into math, and then tell them I'm into roleplaying, unless they're a fellow math geek in some way, then my introducing math first is probably more likely to make them shut down or be dismissive about roleplaying.  Maybe.  I'm not really sure.

Not too long ago, I attempted to put down my thoughts on these very topics here:<br/><a href="http://dariuswolfe.livejournal.com/80322.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dariuswolfe.livejournal.com/80322.html</a><br/><br/>I think the negative reactions have less to do with the activity than they do with the perceptions of the people who partake in the activity. "Normal" people can be interested in the same sorts of stories: fantasy, sci-fi, martial arts, espionage, action. "Normal" people can like to play games of all sorts, video games, board games, card games.. Some of them pretty complex. "Normal" people can be interested in telling stories, and usually do on a regular basis, from funny jokes, things they've had happen to them or that they've done, or heard of. What it is, I think, is that the people who are typically attracted to roleplaying games are people who have social problems.. Geeks and nerds. Thus, roleplaying has come to be associated with the social outcasts who are its primary participants. <br/><br/>As for why people shun these people (like me) I can't say. I wish I knew.<br/><br/>What is the culture's reaction to it? See above; the majority of us have social problems, so it's pretty natural to assume that our reactions to it are going to be less than ideal. We embrace our outcast status by outcasting those who have shunned us. We paint ourselves the reviled geniuses of our age. (It doesn't help that many "geeks and nerds" are possessed of a higher than average intelligence; this only fuels our feelings of superiority) Those who dismiss us, or are perceived as dismissing us are in turn dismissed by us. The attitude is reinforced when we come together and share our grievances and how we've dealt with them. <br/><br/>Can it be improved? Maybe. Our culture is growing up. It will always be a haven for the outcast and socially inept, I think, but more and more people are actually learning to overcome their social problems, and are still involved in the hobby. I happen to know a very attractive, very successful doctor who is an avid D&amp;D gamer. One of my current group is a physically fit, probably good looking (I'm a bad judge of male attractiveness) non-geeky infantryman; This is probably the least geeky, most "manly" career choice one can have. While our hobby isn't really becoming more mainstream, members of the culture are becoming less of the outcast sort. <br/><br/>Should it be? No. I like my insular, holier-than-thou culture. But I'm just one guy, and I'm only half-serious.<br/><br/>Do I sympathize with the aforementioned reactions? Eh, not so much, but I'm not a very sympathetic person. I do, however, understand many of them. In the first list, every gamer knows one or more gamers who truly fits one of those statements. Virgins, slobs, basement dwellers. People who have lost touch with reality, and who might hurt someone. We, as members of our culture, have felt this way about specific members of our culture. In the second list, we've probably all felt this way at some point or another about specific games we don't currently play. As indie games get more out there, I find myself saying "I don't get it", and choosing not to invest my time in finding out. I've felt that people who are into certain games would never let someone with my preferences play with them. <br/><br/>As for other hobbies/interests for which I've met the same types of reactions, yes; Reading, definitely. Interest in computers and programming, yes. Decent skill and interest in math and science, yup. Being a member of the SCA (medieval re-creation society, for them what don't know) a decided yes. At some time or another, I have met with all of the viewpoints in Matt's two lists for some hobby of mine other than gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154753/#Comment_154753" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T17:21:57+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  5:21PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2008 5:22PM by James_Nostack.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil Gow</cite>Look at it this way - imagine Golf? I have some pretty negative feelings about golf (weird, expensive, elitist, time consuming, too many rules, poncy etc). However, I have never had anyone try to recruit me into playing golf, attempt to design a 'beginners' gold game to help me realise my love of the game, challenged my bias against golf or debated the issues behind my assumptions. However, when it comes to gaming, we do all of these things and more.</blockquote>\nNeil, like everyone else I feel you raise a lot of good points, but I suspect your analogy breaks down on two points: <br/><br/>1.  I bet if you're big into golf, and you've got a friend who has never golfed before, you ask 'em to go golfing with you sometime.  And you might feel a little weird if they give you a half-hearted or lame excuse.<br/><br/>2.  By popular stereotype, golf tends to be a game for people of high economic status.  Role-playing games, again by popular stereotype, tended to be played by high school students of low social status (which, I feel, is what Matt Snyder's first batch of sneering questions are all about).

Wonderful post.<br/><br/>Second:<br/>Here's my personal experience with the negative stereotype. I don't identify "gaming" (the big, wide culture of rpgs) as the thing I like to do. I am not part of some vast gamer culture that includes the neck-beard grognards. The negative stereotype doesn't reflect on me, or my friends, or anything we do as part of our hobby -- so the negative reaction doesn't hurt me. I don't feel the need to defend it, or educate people about how they're ignorant, or be any kind of apologist. All of that negative crap is referring to something else -- something I am not a part of.<br/><br/>To use an analogy, I also do fight training (mixed martial arts). There is a huge negative stereotype around fighting, martial arts, and all that, too (it's barbaric, people get hurt, etc.). But that's not what I'm doing. It's not what my friends are doing. That negative stereotype doesn't relate to us in any relevant way. We don't have to defend the UFC to people who have a negative reaction to it.<br/><br/>So, I'm not saying that the negative reaction to the stereotype is unreasonable, or that it doesn't have an effect on the larger culture of the thing (gamers, fighters, bikers, animal-rights activists, you name one...). I'm saying that, for me and almost all the roleplayers I know, identification with the larger culture is meaningless and far, far away from their experience and personal identity. Ignorant or negative reactions to the stereotype of the culture-at-large are simply ignored.<br/><br/>I don't have a stake in how "gamer culture" is perceived. It's not my culture. I don't have a home there.<br/><br/>This is my personal experience and I don't expect it to magically apply beyond my own skin.

This thread has some really great insights across the board.\n<blockquote>So for me the first step in deciding how to react is to reject the thesis that we as the community of gamers (SNIP) are doing anything badwrong.</blockquote>\nRafial, to echo thoughts here, I agree with your post as well. Good stuff. I hazard a guess that you and I would proceed very differently in specifically carrying out the spirit of your post. Which is perfectly natural and great.<br/><br/>I quoted that bit there, because I think it's possible someone could misread my original post as saying we ARE doing badwrongfun. And, no, I'm not saying that. I think the <i>doing</i> of our hobby is wildly interesting, fun, and healthy. All the extraneous stuff, like identity politics, I personally think is not so hot. (Stuff like inside jokes, social issues already raised here in this thread, outcast issues, fighting about stuff for years on the internet, etc.)\n<blockquote>I think the negative reactions have less to do with the activity than they do with the perceptions of the people who partake in the activity. "Normal" people can be interested in the same sorts of stories: fantasy, sci-fi, martial arts, espionage, action.</blockquote>\nThat is my belief as well. And, the rest of your post, Lance? Really great stuff. Thanks for posting that!\n<blockquote>I'm saying that, for me and almost all the roleplayers I know, identification with the larger culture is meaningless and far, far away from their experience and personal identity.</blockquote>\nRock. On.<br/><br/>I know I don't have precisely the same experiences and thinking on this that John does. I say that because I know John, and know of a few of the people he plays with regularly. And, I think he's a really fucking cool individual. So, we're slightly different, but he just said in this quote exactly what I'd like to have said! Those two sentences of his kick ass.\n<blockquote>On the other hand, I have definitely gotten seriously negative reactions from other RPG players for saying that. Apparently it's not okay not to have nerd solidarity in some circles.</blockquote>\nSame here. It's really frustrating and hurtful. I mean, I've been involved with this hobby in some way for over 20 years. So, I knew criticizing this kind of stuff would meet resistance and cause arguments. But, I was staggered, positively blown away at how angry, vicious and hateful it was. My experience with that really flatlined my expectations of the scene.<br/><br/>I think this is a poisonous thing. I think it contributes considerably to the negative reactions among people. Which sucks. <br/><br/>And, again, the reason I personally think it sucks is that it makes it harder for me to find enough people to play the games I'd like to play. As my expectations and respect for "gamers" declines, my willingness to reach out to find new players shrinks. That totally sucks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst" title="zacharythefirst"><img alt="zacharythefirst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst">zacharythefirst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154774/#Comment_154774" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T21:16:24+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  9:16PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite>A thing that my father had trouble to envision when my friends and I would answer his questions about rpgs, was about competitive gaming.

Perhaps I'm being overly sensitive and finding fault where there is none in your original post.  I do, unlike some, self-identify with the gamer community, including neck-beards (I am a wargamer, after all :P ).  And like any community, it has its share of people who are hard to deal with.

Or we give it a name -- Asperger's -- and armchair-diagnose people who, guess what?, might just be socially maladjusted. And this isn't about making people fit into some socially acceptable cubbyhole. It's about getting people to understand good social behavior. Or to deal with habits and hangups that might otherwise be crippling in other ways.<br/><br/>I can't stand being around "gamers." My last con was more than a decade ago. I don't have "gamer" friends; I have friends who are really great people in many ways, and we happen to enjoy many activities together.

But it misses my point, I think. It doesn't matter, <i>to me</i>, that they're not involved in the culture. They're <i>gamers</i>, and as such, my initial reaction is to be more interested in their company than non-gamers. <br/><br/>Now that's not to say that I let cat-piss man remain in my company much past the point that I've realized that I can't stand him. I avoid people of whatever group that make me a less happy Lance, inasmuch as I can; My job has made me realize that sometimes you just have to tolerate people to make worthwhile things happen. It comes down to being a value judgement. If I have to tolerate cat-piss man because I really enjoy the company of his good friend Herbie, then I make a choice: which is greater, my desire to hang out with Herbie, who insists on cat-piss man's presence, or my aversion to the smell of animal urine?<br/><br/>Paul,<br/><br/>So do I defend gamer culture? Somewhat. Generally my defenses are along the lines of "we're not all like that." I acknowledge that there are valid seeds for those stereotypes, but I paint them as the stereotypes they are, and as such, not necessarily true for even the majority of the represented group, so much as the highly-visible minority. <br/><br/>Me, I'm socially maladjusted. Not <b>badly</b> so anymore, but I always feel awkward at any social gathering which doesn't involve "my people" in some way, be they gamers, SCAdians, avid fans of sci-fi or fantasy literature, computer geeks and programmers, etc. I frequently step on my tongue in social situations. I'm arrogant and let it show at times. I'm a know-it-all.<br/><br/>So, yeah.

I don't self-identify as one.<br/><br/>I also agree with many recent posts -- that the visible, commonly recognizable representations of "gamer culture" do not comprise the vast bulk of people playing RPGs. For examples, people attending cons, people hanging out in shops, people posting online, etc. For the most part, I'd guess the VAST majority of people playing RPGs are mostly isolated groups who play semi-routinely at someone's house. And, that's pretty much that.<br/><br/>Further, I suggest, but obviously can't confirm, that among these "isolated" clumps of people, I'd find lots and lots of great gamers. Hell, even in my geographical area. <i>But, I can't find them.</i> (Yes, I've tried many times.) They don't move beyond their group, or outside that house. They are, quite rightly, happy and healthy in the game-playing. And, probably worse, they have many similar thoughts that are posted in this thread. That is, I think they also have some negative, defensible thoughts about "gamer culture" too.

I know for me there isn't much beyond the biological, chronological, factual, or legal. So I'm unlikely to call myself a gamer because I really don't see the benefit or point of calling myself that.<br/><br/>This reminds me of how in medicine there's a push to get patients to stop identifying themselves as diseased, and to identify themselves as having a disease (I have diabetes as opposed to I am diabetic; I have tested positive for HIV as opposed to I am positive). Not that playing story games is a disease.<br/><br/>A couple of stories:<br/><br/>A friend of mine who plays D&amp;D, we were at Volleyball at the Y and we were both sitting out a game at the time, and I turn to him and ask him how his game of D&amp;D went the night before. He replies quickly that they didn't play and then turns his attention back to the game on the court. Later, away from the game, he says to me that I shouldn't ask him about D&amp;D in public, and I say why not, and he says because there's women there, although, he goes on to tell me, they did have a good time.<br/>_____<br/><br/>Recently, I'm on my way home from playing some Universalis and I stop by to see a friend and he asks me what I did in the afternoon. I tell him I played a story game. He asks what that is, and I tell him it's a bit like improv. It's a game where the goal is to tell a story together that we create on the spot. He says that sounds really cool. I say, indeed it was. Then, for fun I ask him if he's ever heard of Dungeons and Dragons or Roleplaying games. He says yes and makes a face. The kind he might have made if I'd said, have you ever poured yourself a cup of monkey semen and drank it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154982/#Comment_154982" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T11:47:19+00:00" title="July  5, 2008 11:47AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2008 11:49AM by Lord_Minx.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really fascinating thread and very thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Personally, I do self-identify as a gamer, even though I have neither much contact with stereotypical "gamer culture" nor fulfill most of the classicial stereotype. (I'm a social being, have a healthy longterm relationship, get enough sex, don't look bad, bath regularly, all the cats I've ever had knew where to piss, ...) On the other hand, I do go to conventions, have a friendly "aquaintanceship" with the owner of a local FLGS and most of my friends are gamers too. <br/><br/>But I think when I say "I'm a gamer", I say this not really in relation to an outside society or community. This part of my identity is self-given and self-centered, in that I am part of the "gaming community" that consists of the people I game with. And our "gaming" is the activity that we happen to do, whatever somebody else choses to call "gaming".<br/><br/>And it's into this community that I want to introduce people, not necessarily any other "gamer community" (Although there is some overlap, obviously.) and it's this community that I feel welcome in and a part of.<br/><br/>But then I've never had any kind of problem because of my self-identification as a gamer. The closest I've ever been to "flak for calling yourself gamer" was when a friend told me about the time his mother asked, about the Vampire larp he was in, "But, Andi, you're not drinking real blood there, right?", which is just funny and nothing else. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I didn't even get stuff from the second list when I introduced other people, except for "What if I do it wrong", which was pretty easily solved. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154987/#Comment_154987" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T12:09:12+00:00" title="July  5, 2008 12:09PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What am I supposed to do now with all these "Matt Snyder is such a fucking gamer" t-shirts I'm bringing to Gen Con?<br/><br/>I mean besides sell them at 15% off.<br/><br/>To add to what John and others have said about relating to gamerdom, I had a lot of trouble finding people to play with in the entirety of the 90s.

If you cut up a steak, you are a cook and if you plant a flower box, yes actually right then you are a gardener.<br/><br/>I know you don't want to be linked to some stereotype of what gaming is, but making up new little categories which the rest of the universe will not, indeed cannot use because they are so obscure even within the the subcultural group?  That doesn't seem a useful way forward, IMO.<br/><br/>I get it: you don't reek of cat piss.  The thing though is that the rest of the world never assumed you did, because gaming's really not that important, and so struggling hard not to be a "gamer" looks odd and defensive and weird to a far greater extent than just being a gamer (again in MO).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155022/#Comment_155022" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T16:53:41+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  4:53PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Timothy FTW!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155026/#Comment_155026" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T17:27:30+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  5:27PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, my Dad's into golf.

Enthusiasm makes you geek out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the kindest thing we can do, when we have a strong interest in something, is to realize that other people don't share it. And they don't have to. And we shouldn't try and make them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a new social situation, feel free to mention it, to see if anyone else responds positively, but if no one really seems to care, just drop it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, you can also listen for social cues, too. If everyone in the room is talking about the pernicious influence of the occult on today's youth, mentioning that you play a roleplaying game may cause some negative reactions. If the roleplaying game you mention is something like Vampire or Sorceror or Kult, you may want to avoid bringing it up all together.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt did take me about a decade to learn this trick. Is that because I'm socially inept? Eh. A little.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't really blame other people for their perceptions. Some of them, gamerdom does encourage and I've encouraged, because I don't mind.<br/>\nSometimes it's better to "own" a criticism if correcting it isn't one of your priorities. <br/>\nFor instance, perhaps personal appearance isn't a big issue. Perhaps you consider that vanity and brush it aside.<br/>\nIf it gets to the point where you crap your pants so you don't have to leave the gaming table, it might be considered deviant behavior, but if you're health isn't suffering noticeably and you can still find gamers, you're probably okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worry these sometimes that these criticisms can be used on a larger scale to "help" me in a coercive manner, you know, as an excuse to hospitalize me or give me medications or restrict my movements, but when our society reaches that point, it might be time for a revolution, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil then, I'll write it off as paranoia and sing "I'm Only Thinking of Him" nervously to myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155043/#Comment_155043" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T20:59:53+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  8:59PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Timothy</cite>Maybe I have lived a fortunate and sheltered life, but I have seen far, far, far more people complaining online about the poor personal hygenie of gamers than actually have seen gamers with poor personal hygenie.</blockquote>\nIt only takes one to offend about 150.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155047/#Comment_155047" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T22:11:30+00:00" title="July  5, 2008 10:11PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>But then, man, I tried to form a band a zillion times and all I found were people way freakier than the freakiest gamers I ever stood in a room with.</blockquote>\nHoly crap is this true.

I like talking about our shared lore, the founding of D&amp;D, why Lorraine Williams was Satan Incarnate (or not), arguing about this designer or that company and why they do or do not suck, our abhorrence/acceptance/indifference to Power Gamers or Munchkins.  It can be as simple as talking about player types, character classes, difficulty of adventuring, or how the dice roll--those last bits are pretty universal in a lot of gaming groups--at least all the ones I've been in, and I've gamed plenty<br/><br/>My friends and I have a shared hobby, and we like to talk shop about it.  A lot of it is the sort of thing that can be turned on or off or easily explained to a new gamer, and they'll have their own opinions on it soon enough.  I know I'm not a social misfit, and I'm fine calling myself "gamer" because it doesn't do anything to hurt me, and to me it isn't a negative stereotype.  If it is to others, calling myself a "storyteller", or "immersionist" or "dice engineer" or trying to redefine it in different terms isn't going to change the fact it'll usually eventually come back around to "oh, is that like that D&amp;D stuff?".  The best thing I can do is treat it as a hobby I'm passionate about, continue not being a fuckwad in social situations, demo to the interested, and find other points of interest with the uninterested.  But make no mistake:  I am a gamer. But I'm also a camper, writer, history buff, proud parent, book worm, and a dozen other things.  I just do not see that any more exlusionist or awkward or harmful than when a book worm talks about their reading list, golfers talk about their new drivers and course layout, or football fans talk about why they hate the prevent defense.

I spent years playing RPGs without feeling compelled to talk about those things. I'm not saying you shouldn't talk about them, but you're putting me in a box where I don't belong. And that is part of what some people are feeling.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a negative stereotype either, but I also disagree that it comes round to 'that D&amp;D stuff'.

They make sense. I'm not certain if they're dead on. They're interesting! Something I notice about the last group ("don't care one way or the other") is that those folks tend so say "I'm a gamer, so what? It's like any hobby." <br/><br/>And, I don't agree. I don't think it's completely <i>unique</i> as a hobby necessarily. I do think it differs in many specific ways from golf, knitting, cycling, etc. And, while I definitely sympathize with the good intent -- which I'd describe something like "don't worry so much, it isn't so bad" -- I think the language surrounding may dismiss many things that matter to other people in this thread and the hobby in general. <br/><br/>For example, if I argue that regular folks think, oh, the jargon in the hobby is exclusionary, it's not much of a defense to say "Well, pool players have jargon, too, so it's not really a problem." That's a disingenuous argument. Of course they're right. Pool players do have jargon. But, this fact doesn't make either pool jargon or gaming jargon ok, if indeed the jargon is exclusionary to people.<br/><br/>And, I think I see some of that going on here. Again, I see the cause for saying that. It's not heinous and wrong or anything. But, it doesn't wash away a negative perception. In fact, it may just hide it away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155076/#Comment_155076" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T08:26:29+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  8:26AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I get it: you don't reek of cat piss. The thing though is that the rest of the world never assumed you did, because gaming's really not that important, and so struggling hard not to be a "gamer" looks odd and defensive and weird to a far greater extent than just being a gamer </blockquote>\nThat's too bad. Because, sure, I guess it's possible that I am being defensive and also unable to confront it or admit it or something. But, I don't think that's what's going on here. I don't see myself as being defensive. (Weird, maybe!) <br/><br/>And, this is the reaction I get all the time. "Jeez, Snyder, why are you so defensive about being a gamer!?!"<br/><br/>Well, again, that's certainly possible, and I'm too shamed to admit it or something. But, it is the only conclusion you can reach about this issue I keep raising? I think there are other conclusions that, given another consideration, make sense too. I find it pretty insulting, really. I'm not <i>angry</i> at you or anything of the kind. <br/><br/>Here's where I'm coming from. When I raise this issue, people accuse me of being secretly ashamed of myself or defensive about being a gamer. And, I find that pretty strange. <br/><br/>From my perspective, what it says is "Hey, Matt, if you question the way we all do things 'round here, then there must be something wrong with you. <i>We're</i> all fine here. What the heck could possibly be your problem? You must be psychologically damaged or something."<br/><br/>Well, no, I don't believe that I am. I may be trying to discuss or even accomplish a very <i>difficult</i> thing. It's may even be impossible to have role-playing expand from it's current fuzzy borders and become a more routine leisure activity. Which, that itself may be crazy. But, I don't think it's me being defensive or ashamed. I'm really kinda tired of being accused of that.<br/><br/>Right now, with some cool exceptions (some of 'em really big exceptions), it sorta works like this: To play chess, you have to be in the chess club. Particularly if you want to find other people to play chess with. (i.e. To enjoy RPGs, you have to be a gamer. To find gamers, you have to be a gamer, too.) <br/><br/>I'm saying it'd be much nicer for me to play chess at home or at the park or with grandpa or whatever. I don't really have time / want to be in the chess club. My lifestyle is quite different from many, many gamers. It's the same as many gamers, too, which is great. Heck, it's why I'm still here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155082/#Comment_155082" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T09:09:44+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  9:09AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2008 11:04AM by Ben_Lehman.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In homage to Jeff's post, which basically speaks to me, I'd like to offer the following chart. It's a venn diagram in text form. Hopefully it makes sense.<br/><br/><code><br/>[.....................................people...................................]<br/>[the gamer community]<br/>..[people who actually play games]<br/></code><br/><br/>For much of my life, I occupied the "p" of "people who actually play games:" I was completely disconnected from the gamer community. The only source of new books we had was a cousin of a friend of mine who visited once a year and let us look at his stuff. Everything else was used book store material.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the Lorraine Williams stuff was going on at the time, I would not have been able to tell you about it, because the sole contact I had with any news of TSR at all was one issue of Dragon magazine someone left at a college gaming club and I picked up, which had a Buck Rogers preview in it (also, a plane scape preview.)<br/><br/>It was not until, maybe, 15 that I had any contact with the gaming world at large (my friend J got really into World of Darkness) and it was not until college that I had any sense of what the gamer community was to the point of, say, understanding stereotypes about them. Yet the entire time I was playing role-playing games constantly. So it's entirely possible to play games and not really understand the existence of community with other gamers, or even be aware that you could.<br/><br/>Right now I'm more at the "ll" in "actually."<br/><br/>Also, I would like to illustrate the rest of droog's point, which is excellent, about who I play with, am friends with, and thus, who I consider to have any social relationship or social responsibility with.<br/><br/><code><br/>[.....................................people.......................................]<br/>[the gamer community]<br/>..[people who actually play

PLACE.]</b><br/><br/>Hey, I deleted my earlier post because it was accidentally hostile.<br/><br/><br/>Matt,<br/>It sounds like you want to be a member of the community but not the culture. Like, you want to participate in design discussions and talk about games obviously, because you're posting here and you've got a podcast and so on. But you don't want to be tagged with the same labels that some people here wear with pride and others wear with shame.<br/><br/>That's cool. I think that's fair.<br/><br/>But I want to know a bit about your motivations for starting this thread. You're posting this thread in a volatile place (the internet), in a place where many people are choosing to self-designate "nerd" and "geek" titles, and where lots of people post at. If you don't want to "buy into" the culture, why post this thread? Is it a validation thing? Is it that you want to affect sweeping change throughout our community, taking down the stereotypical culture that you dislike?<br/><br/>You often hear the response that "you're clearly defensive and ashamed". And you say that isn't the motivational springboard for this conversation. I 100% believe you. I'm curious what the springboard IS. What is your reason for starting this thread in this place?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155092/#Comment_155092" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T10:51:45+00:00" title="July  6, 2008 10:51AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2008 10:54AM by Z-Dog.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why do negative reactions surface? <br/>\n<br/>\n90 percent of the population has no idea what gaming and gamers are. If they do, they heard something about Dnd is Evil back in the 1980s. Most peeps just go: Oh, Dnd? It's still around? <br/>\n<br/>\nBut mainly just Stereotypes about nerds, geeks, dweebs, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI teach middle school and its been very interesting to see how much stress and drama EVERY click and group goes though. When I was in school myself, I thought I was the outcast, etc. But I see every group get shit, often from within the group itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink the popular kids have it made? Think again.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, again, back to stereotypes: you don't know what it is. So golfers are...ummm...rich white people, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat, if anything, is the gamer-culture's reaction to it? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the reactions above are good. Generally, I'd say we do what every group does when threatened (pick one in varying degrees):<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Ignore<br/>\n2. Hide<br/>\n3. Attack (flaunt it, rub it in their face).<br/>\n4. Turn on each other<br/>\n5. Disown membership from the group (this is me)<br/>\n<br/>\nCan or should it improve? How? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think it's every going to improve. Are stereotypes of Artists, Writers, (whatever) ever going to improve?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you, as a gamer, sympathize with any negative reactions like this (I do, for one).<br/>\n<br/>\nYes I do. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've got a lot to say about this last part, but I'd like to think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Hey Matt, is there some experience you've had recently that prompted your original post beyond the reference to the other discussion?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that came up in your life?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155093/#Comment_155093" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T10:53:39+00:00" title="July  6, 2008 10:53AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great discussion!<br/><br/>I can definitely relate:<br/><br/>I love roleplaying games, and any games that create story, have a shared imaginary space, etc (let's not worry about trying to define this, OK?). But I don't share any of the other traits commonly associated with "gamers" (I'm not into anime/manga, comics, wargames, miniatures, LARPs, video games, etc, for starters).<br/><br/>I can also relate to Matt (Weber): I like math and music theory, and mentioning either often provokes uncomfortable or negative reactions, unless I also make some joke or throw in a self-denigrating comment. <br/><br/>So, this conversation is dead on, for me. It makes me think of a couple of things:<br/><br/>First, I've been involved in designing pure storytelling games for the last year or two. No roleplaying involved: just creating stories. Having just moved to a new city where I knew no "gamers", I approached some of my new friends, or even friendly acquaintances and asked them if they would like to playtest one of my games. The response was 99% positive! And always civil and polite. No "ewww" reactions whatsoever. <br/><br/>I asked people of all sorts--not limited to any particular social group. One (but only one) person was revealed to have played an RPG before. To everyone else, it was totally new territory. Probably 80% of the people I asked actually came and played, and only one person didn't express the desire to play again (although they had a good time).<br/><br/>So, that's an interesting data point.<br/><br/>The second thing is observing people talking about stuff they're _really into_. We all know how someone who's a little more enthusiastic than the common bear about their favoured field of interest can turn a party or social event to uncomfortable silence.<br/><br/>Well (and please, folks, try not to be offended, OK?), an interesting analogy can be drawn to strongly religious individuals. I have many very devout Christian friends, and it's been interesting to observe how people react to them in socially-mixed environments. Together, they can laugh and make inside jokes and reference, make fun of their own kind, etc--just like gamers. But in mixed company, some do well and some flounder.<br/><br/>The ones who do well are the ones who don't try to preach or instantly become defensive, but display patience, restraint, and, perhaps most important: tremendous, calm confidence. They invite you in to talk, should you wish, but don't have any obvious need to spout off in your direction, to proselytize, to defend what they believe. That calm confidence is enough to draw people in to ask _them_ what it's all about.<br/><br/>There's a good lesson there for "gamers" (whoever they/we may be), I feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155095/#Comment_155095" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T11:01:37+00:00" title="July  6, 2008 11:01AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>The ones who do well are the ones who don't try to preach or instantly become defensive, but display patience, restraint, and, perhaps most important: tremendous, calm confidence.

Over the couple weeks I've had a number of conversations with people at my work about my gaming hobbies (both playing and designing). This is because I regularly play with two other people at work, so we talk about scheduling and geek out when we're working together, and I've had to publicly explain to my boss about why I take certain weeks off (for conventions), so it's common knowledge around the shop that I'm into gaming. Some people don't ask about it, cuz they're not interested. Some people go "so what exactly do you do?" and I answer the question, and sometimes they go "cool, sounds fun" and thats it and sometimes they keep asking questions. I try really hard not to be defensive or evasive, I just answer questions the same way as when people ask me where I live or how I got into my line of work. It seems to be working out well so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155125/#Comment_155125" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T14:47:20+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  2:47PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2008 2:48PM by Matt Snyder.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you don't want to "buy into" the culture, why post this thread?

What is your reason for starting this thread in this place?</blockquote>\n<br/>Excellent questions, and totally fair! Read charitably, I'm talking, I'm not defending or arguing.<br/><br/>First, if I didn't post here, then nothing happens. Literally, nothing. Either I post here to talk about and challenge some of the taken-for-granted identity issues in the hobby, or I don't. And, if I don't ... I exit the culture by not doing so. Correct? That is, to the extent that, at a minimum, I'm here posting questions of this topic, I'm "involved." And, to the extent I not do those things, I cease to be involved. (My online activity since about March is basically nothing. The podcast est kaputz. My eagerness to attend events dwindles recently.)<br/><br/>The springboard is a long-winded mish-mash of thoughts, like so: <br/><br/>Our hobby is terrible at reaching out to non-gamers. It happens by social chaos more than any actually directed plan. The indie scene, I believe, has begun to "compete" with itself for people's time and, probably, money. (I use quotes because it's hardly a hurtful, nasty competitive scene.) There was a time when we publishers actually said out loud "we do not actually compete." I think, but am not sure, this is no longer true. This is not bad in my view, incidentally; it is just different.<br/><br/>If we are unable to recognize target niches both <i>among</i> gamers and also <i>among non-gamers</i> we will be doing much worse than we could be. And, if we cannot question the make-up, needs, and demands of creator-owned publishers, we're left with a couple hundred sales instead of, oh a couple thousand. I'd rather have a couple thousand given the choice. <br/><br/>I have near publication 44, a game about which I'd estimate 5% of the active scene of the indie world is aware. Which makes sense. The game isn't published. But, it is an ashcan. Anyway, when I publish the game -- which is good! -- I'd rather not have to wait three years to acquire, oh, 200 sales. I'd rather identify people who would value this game, and market it so they choose it over any other horror or one-shot game out there.<br/><br/>I believe the "hobby" is needlessly constraining as a defined entity. There is almost zero effort to do anything but please the <i>exisiting</i> pool of hobbyists. And, that the industry (indie or traditional) does so at its peril. When I talk guys in college, when I watch my nephews, I see them choosing video games in particular over any other leisure time hobby. It's FAR easier, and much more immediately fun, than almost any RPG.<br/><br/>I believe the the lack of marketing toward younger people especially means that the numbers entering the hobby are 1) far fewer 2) far more "hard core" and 3) far more likely to be people on the fringe of social circles. Good or bad. If nothing else, it makes them harder to find. I'm sure Wizards of the Coast is doing stuff to reach these people, but I don't know what they're plan is. I don't much care. I'm much more interested in the indie scene, as you can imagine.<br/><br/>Additionally, I believe that catering to the existing market's "wants" is actually based on marketing to the <i>hard core</i> exisiting markets wants. This is also at the industry's peril as it tends to let the moderate hobbyist drift away. That guy whose wife "used" to play, but actually doesn't much anymore? No one's really reaching her, and clearly we have games she'd totally dig. She's unaware they exist, and slightly frustrated.

Either they want to try or they don't. If they have built up apprehension, offer to let them try an easy 15 minute game or whatever.<br/><br/>When you look at the vast majority of games played in the world, most can be explained in 5 minutes or less and then play starts. Most rpgs take much longer. Herein is the problem. Rpgs, because they take so long to learn and prepare for, are assumed not to be like normal games. Not being normal is seen in a negative light and there you have it.<br/><br/>Anyway, not exactly what you're asking about, but with a game that has these following elements, I think you can directly address some of these issues:\n<blockquote>A few design ideas to incorporate into gateway style games to help introduce people to role-playing:<br/><br/>   1. No prep.<br/>   2. Easy to learn the basics or it doesn\u2019t take twenty minutes trying to explain how to play. \u201cAppealing and quickly playable.\u201d \u201cFew minutes to learn, lifetime to master.\u201d Not \u201crules-lite\u201d or \u201cdumbed-down\u201d<br/>   3. Add a board or some physical representation of the imagined space. \u201cWhat kind of game is it?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s a little like a board game?\u201d<br/>   4. Lose the term \u201crole-playing.\u201d It\u2019s a game.<br/>   5. Somehow reduce or remove a central power figure or no GM.<br/>   6. Include more items to spark creative imaginings or you don\u2019t have to make stuff up and play pretend.<br/>   7. Shorter playing time, and no expectation of multiple session play.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155128/#Comment_155128" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T15:22:13+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  3:22PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In the case of actors, though, at least lots of them are hot. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></blockquote>\nVery true.

You want to be a part of the gamer culture. You want to change that gamer culture to suit your own needs.<br/><br/>Your needs are a perfectly valid balance of personal interest and altruistic vision. You want a social circle where people play games, are creatively forward thinkers, connect over content more than industry gossip, who get to be whole, well-rounded people. You want people to be picky about who they game with, because that's normal and healthy. You want people to see gamers as sexy, interesting, creative people... at least in part because that's brandable and a targetable market, and it makes it easier for you to say "44! It's the game for you, Mr. Edgy, Characterizing Cool Dude" and it makes it easier for WotC to say "Dungeons and Dragons! It's the game for you, Mr. Fun-Loving, Action-Craving, Keen-Eyed Dude!" instead of both of you having to rely on the traditional, lame, inaffective advertising of the past.<br/><br/>You want gamers to be a collection of people, rather than quirks.<br/><br/><br/>Is that fair and accurate? The reason I'm suggesting that this is true is because I'm seeing a gap in your "case": You're saying you don't want to be a "gamer", but what I see you actually angling towards is a shift in what "gamer" means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155131/#Comment_155131" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T16:10:08+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  4:10PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>I believe the the lack of marketing toward younger people especially means that the numbers entering the hobby are [ . . . ] far more likely to be people on the fringe of social circles.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure I see how this follows.  After all, as you pointed out, it's much easier to play a video game.  RPGs, on the other hand, are both hard, and intrinsically a social activity.  I don't deny that there are plenty of socially awkward/inept misfits that are "gamers" (hell, i'm almost definitely in that category myself) but I don't really see how it follows from the lack of marketing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155133/#Comment_155133" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T16:56:42+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  4:56PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2008 4:57PM by Matt Snyder.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, <br/><br/>I'm not asking you to assume my approach here. It's essentially me going out on a limb, particularly on that point you cite. I'm interested in how game-creators understand potential customers needs and wants, and how to sell them games they actually find valuable. It's part of a large, messy overlapping chain of thoughts I've had stewing around inside my head for months now. And, as I spill out some of that stew in pieces, it's odd and tough to put together. That's because I don't even have it all put together! I'm still trying to figure out how to cook this stuff together.<br/><br/>My point was this: If video games, rather than RPGs, become the most popular means for enthusiasts that might otherwise have become RPG-ers, then RPG becomes and even-more fringe activity. That might be unvoidable. So far so good. My next leap is to suggest that therefore more eccentric individuals will dig the activity of RPGs instead. I make the mostly-unsupportable claim that those thinned out herds aren't likely to be good for the hobby. Of course I can be wrong. Likely? Maybe so. I don't think it matters much in the long run. Even if I'm wrong about it, the point about video games likely thinning out the hobby remains. That's a real problem.<br/><br/><br/>Joe, \n<blockquote>Is that fair and accurate? The reason I'm suggesting that this is true is because I'm seeing a gap in your "case": You're saying you don't want to be a "gamer", but what I see you actually angling towards is a shift in what "gamer" means. </blockquote>\nOf course. Sounds about 98% good to me.<br/><br/>I see a semantical problem surrounding the word "gamer." No biggie as far as I can tell. I'm saying that I don't <i>care</i> who calls himself or herself a gamer. I'm not antagonistic to the word. I am apathetic to it. It's almost useless to me because it confuses people, precisely because they've already got <i>identity</i> loaded into the word. I probably haven't stricken it from my usage, but maybe I should? I think it wastes time as people go, "Wait wait. So, you're a gamer, but not a gamer? What are you, some kind of hypocritical freak? You're not making sense!" I think I am making sense, and people are getting caught up on words I'm probably using just because I always have.<br/><br/>You can, of course, describe my intent as re-appropriating the word gamer. I don't mind. I don't want anything in particular to do with that word. Not as in "Oh, that word is poison! Don't use it." Rather, as in "Gamer, whatever. I don't care, so long as we makes some sense together."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155145/#Comment_155145" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T20:28:10+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  8:28PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2008 8:40PM by Deliverator.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joepub \u2014 I think your description of what Matt Snyder wants to see is really evocative and eutopic and cool!  I'm going to go out on a limb here, one based on my other big interests (math and education and literature), and say that the only way we're going to get that society (or larger subset of society, whatever) is to improve our overall level of education and intellectual engagement in the U.S.  (I note that we don't seem to have heard from any of our Scandinavian brethren on this thread... I've gotten the impression that there are ways in which gaming is seen very, very differently in those countries, though I may be wrong.)  <br/><br/>Roleplaying well, for several values of "well" (which may be different Creative Agendas or whatever), requires at least some if not all of the following: an incredibly active, vivid, and open-minded imagination, broad literary and historical knowledge, improvisational acting talent, math, logic and min/maxing skills, tactical or strategic reasoning, the ability to read subtle social cues, and the ability to be socially non-flaky in terms of scheduling.  Some of these qualities may not require formal education, but a lot of them do.  <br/><br/>Moreover, we need to have a culture that values art and creativity differently.  It's not that we don't recognize the worth of musicians and authors, but we don't sufficiently recognize music and literature as valuable things for *non-professionals to participate in*.  I've recently gotten involved with a social group that is very into participatory music, primarily via the singing of rounds.  Roleplaying is, as a very rough analogy, the literary equivalent of roundsinging.  And both are seen as pretty weird, which sucks.<br/><br/>Paul T. \u2014 I want to riff off of the whole idea of "other strong interests," socially acceptable or otherwise.  First of all, most of my gamer friends\u2014that is, people I am friends with and with whom I game, regardless of the labels they use for themselves\u2014have strong interests outside of gaming *at least some of which I share*.  I think there are a couple of reasons for this, which I will enumerate from worst to best.  <br/><br/>(1) Most unflatteringly, it's because I am a complete misfit and can only hang out with people who are incredibly similar to me.<br/>(2) Roleplaying is not sufficient social glue to hold friendship and/or friend groups together; roleplaying groups that don't die almost always consist of people who hang out together outside of game, as far as I can tell.<br/>(3) People with strong intellectual interests that are at most tangentially related to gaming *make for better, more interesting gamers*.  They bring more creativity and knowledge to the table than people whose sole strong interests are gaming and fandom.  As a bonus, they may also be more likely to have rich, varied lives outside of gaming.<br/><br/>Let me be quick to point out that, in my experience, there are far more gamers of the desirable, have-other-cool-qualities type than the semi-mythical Guy Who Cares Only About Gaming.  Just as, as was pointed out upthread, there are far more well-adjusted, balanced, healthy gamers than there are Cat Piss Men.<br/><br/>Additionally, overlapping activity groupings seem anecdotally to be quite common.  My and Ben L's college gaming group, for example, has lots of people who are also into ballroom dancing and ballroom dance together *as an official group activity*, even though ballroom dance objectively has nothing to do with roleplaying gaming.  Recently, I've gotten involved with the self-identified-ish geek group of a small liberal arts college, most of whose members are not roleplayers but are into sci fi literature and movies and other related things.  And most of them are also into (several, overlapping!) music scenes and activities (including the aforementioned roundsinging), that again, objectively have nothing whatsoever to do with their group's purpose.  There's nothing wrong with this phenomenon at all, but I think it's worth exploring vis-a-vis Matt Snyder's desire for more and better gaming and more and better gamers.<br/><br/>This whole discussion is also causing me to think a lot about how lukewarm I generally am nowadays when I meet someone who plays D&amp;D or Exalted.  I think my sort of cold-ish, "Yeah, I'm into RPGs too, but not really D&amp;D so much anymore" reaction is basically because non-Indie gamers have effectively ceased to be "my people."  This isn't, I don't think, me being defensive or trying to be all, "yeah, I'm a gamer, but not one of *those* people."  (Many people who only play trad games are probably cool people, and I might have a lot of other stuff to talk about with them, but I can't game with them.)  It's just an artifact of the direction in which my social life has gone in recent years. <br/><br/>Matt Weber                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Sure, there are the exceptions (Faeries Tale, Zorcerer of Zo etc) but there simply aren't enough. As an example, when we were staffing the Collective Endeavour stall at Games Expo this year we were asked numerous times whether we had any family friendly games. I think the nearest we could come was Piledrivers &amp; Powerbombs!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have promised myself that after I work Duty &amp; Honour out of my system, I am going to do a 'kids game'<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that isn't enough - and I think I might be getting the point now. Say we make a game thats really cool for kids. A pokemon for the rpg world, and we get lots of kids roleplaying - what happens next?<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at my two daughters, who love roleplaying, and I look at Cat-Piss Man, Whitier-Than-Thou Lad, I LIVE GAMING GUY and all of the other roleplaying stereotypes that exist within gaming culture and I wonder .... do I *really* think they are ready to be exposed to those people? And then I look at my gaming friends, who are all family friends, and I think ... but they are already exposed to these people?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose its like being into Star Trek? You can like the series, you can collect some memorabilia but eventually, as you move through the hobby, you are going to meet the guy who dresses as a Klingon, speaks in Klingon and has his living room decked out like a Bird of Prey. Just too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know what to do about this. I think that if I started gaming now, I would shy away from associating with some of our more colourful stereotypes, just like when I played CCGs I stayed far away from the hypercompetitive 'win at all costs' brigade.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean that, for the future of the hobby, we need to purge these unclean (literally and metaphorically) influences? Re-educate them? Embrace them? I have no idea.

People can watch Star Trek without anyone thinking they're a trekkie, yet playing RPGs is linked to being a gamer. It's that association that I just don't understand and which, I feel, hinders me when it comes to having fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155227/#Comment_155227" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T11:23:59+00:00" title="July  7, 2008 11:23AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2008 11:26AM by fnord3125.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>People can watch Star Trek without anyone thinking they're a trekkie</blockquote>\nI'm not sure this is true.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br>And I'm also not sure that I'm one of the people that thinks saying "I'm a non-gamer that games" makes any sense.

To me, the former is saying, "Hey, once in a while I have fun playing golf. I really like best ball tourneys because it's more fun for me when others help. I have to borrow my brother's clubs, though." <br><br>The latter is more like saying "I'm really into golfing. My buddies and I have tee times every Saturday, and I'm a member of the country club. My handicap is 12. I own my own clubs, but I hate my driver. I subscribe to Golf Digest. Next year, my partner and I are getting our own golf cart and trailer to transport it on. I really can't stand it when casual golfers don't let us members play through. They're wasting our time! Hey, did you hear the one about the priest and the rabbai playing golf?"<br><br>In short, one is an activity, the other is activity + identity. It's not just "what you do" but also "who you <i>are</i>" in social terms, personal terms, and more.<br><br>To bring it back to RPGs ... <br><br>For some reason, my experiences among the hobby is that saying "I'm a <i>gamer</i>" is as much about what you do (play games) as it is about who you are (dedicated, shares in-jokes, attends cons, collects multiple editions of games, etc.). Whereas, saying "Sometimes I enjoy playing RPGs" is fairly difficult to encounter without the idenity portion. It seems like it's an "either you're in our you're out" kind of thing, where being "in" means participating in the culture of gaming, and being out means "I used to play, but I don't anymore" or "I never play, or never did." I'd prefer some middle ground there.<br><br>I think there's been an urgent move in this thread to jump to extremes, and thereby ignore whether there's any fuzzy ground between things. Saying "Well, Matt, if you game, you're a gamer. What's the problem? Case closed."<br><br>I don't think it's so cut and dried. If it were, then "gamer" would ONLY mean "one who plays games." It would NOT mean things like "Plays games and also laughs out loud when someone says 'I waste him with my crossbow!' or 'Where are the CHEEE-TOS?' " And, yet, pretty obviously, many people would say "Oh, yeah, those are totally 'gamer' jokes." Why? Because they celebrate and poke fun at the traditions of the culture of gaming. It's good humor. It's funny. <br><br>But, it's only funny if you ever read and enjoyed Knights of the Dinner Table, an entire comic parody of playing D&amp;D specifically, or if you ever hung out with high school buddies talking about girls, eating junk food, arguing about rules, and playing D&amp;D. If you said those lines to "one who plays games" like, say, Steal Away Jordan or whatever, they'd probably look at you puzzled, like "What are you talking about? I don't get it."\n<blockquote>If you write you're a "writer" and there are stereotypes associated with being a writer. If you play golf you're a "golfer" and there are stereotypes associated with being a golfer. There are stereotypes associated with any activity.</blockquote>\nI agree! There are indeed stereotypes related to those activities. I assume you mean that, therefore, there's not much to be done about it? That it's just the way things are? What do you think a person should do if they don't like the way things are? (He said sincerely!)<br><br>Because, I read that, and I <i>think</i> I understand what you mean. That these stereotypes don't bother you too much, would that be fair to say? That, all things considered, you're happy with the hobby as it is. That's really understandable. I get that, and that's great!<br><br/>In turn, I hope you could see how someone like me who isn't all that enthused with the hobby would much rather see different options to enjoy rather than having to choose between participating or not participating at all!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155246/#Comment_155246" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T13:16:12+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  1:16PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2008 1:16PM by amnesiack.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by Neil Gow</cite>I really dig Matt's (Synders) point that RPGs are simply not marketed at kids or even designed for kids.

The second one just conforms to the "golfer" stereotype, which is exactly what I'm talking about.  Same goes with the distinctions between the kinds of "gamers" you mention.  One matches a lot of the stereotypes and one doesn't.<br/><br/>I can see why a person might choose or choose not to apply a label to him or herself like "gamer" or "golfer" because, as you say, it says something about one's idenity.  But so does saying, "sometimes I enjoy RPGs."  Labels like that can be voluntarily chosen by someone or applied to them by others.  You might not choose to say "I'm a golfer" because you only play on rare occaisions and have to borrow clubs from your brother when you do so, but if someone you know sees you out on the course they may very well start saying, "Oh yeah, did you know?  Matt's a golfer!"<br/><br/>It's completely fair to want to control which labels and "identities" are applied to you.  So if there is a reason you don't want to be known as (or think of yourself as) a "gamer," I get it.  That's fine.  But it seems that, at least in part, what some of the people here who are (apparently quite adamantly) saying "I play RPGs but I'm not a gamer!" are really saying is that they don't want the "gamer" stereotype applied to them.  Which is also totally understandable and reasonable.<br/><br/>Do I have a problem with the stereotypes?  Sure, sometimes.  I have a problem with ALL stereotypes.  They're not usually very accurate.  And when people jump to conclusions because they're told that someone is a "golfer" or a "soccer fan" or a "gamer" or whatever it annoys the heck out of me.  But I also recognize that you can't make stereotypes go away.  That DOESN'T however mean that I think there is nothing that can be done about it and that if you don't like it you should just suck it up and be quiet.  I think it's definitely possible (though slow and probably difficult) to change stereotypes.<br/><br/>Also, maybe I'm totally off-base here, but one reason I have some difficulty with people here that are saying, "I enjoy RPGs but I'm not really a gamer" is because RPGs are clearly important enough to everyone here that they're bothering to participate in online forum discussions about them.  I'm making assumptions, but to me, that doesn't seem like the type of thing someone does if they're only interested in an activity in a very casual sort of way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155256/#Comment_155256" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T13:43:17+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  1:43PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil Gow</cite>Look at it this way - imagine Golf?

Pretty widely around the U.S., there are miniature golf venues which are very much designed for beginners and kids.  They have special rates for kids birthday parties, for example, and they put a lot of effort into fun-looking backgrounds for play.  My son was invited to a miniature golf birthday party a few months ago.  We went and had fun.  I also know that a huge amount of effort goes into setting up sports organizations, and a lot goes into making the kids leagues open and fun for beginners.  <br/><br/>Sure, there are differences in how golf organizers versus RPG publishers work, just as there are differences between golfers and gamers.  But I don't think that level or recruitment differs, nor identity.  My impression is that golfers are pretty casual about having golf logos or gold themed items around the office -- moreso than RPG gamers have RPG themed items.

I mean, why the heck do I, a friggin' publisher of multiple RPGs, say all this stuff and bother to post here, yet claim like a wildman to want it to all be more casual? That's a strange position to be in, and it's one that, in previous conversations, leads people to say some really odd or even hurtful things to me about it.<br/><br/>First off, there's not many other places to do it right now! A few, but not many. <br/><br/>But, really, the answer is mainly two things. <br/><br/>1) First, this isn't strictly about me. I'm fishing around for a means to identify other more casual groups of game-players (gamers, role-players whatever you want to call 'em). Sure, I'm much more dedicated than those people might be. But, I'd sure like to find them, and play games with them! I think a few other folks share that sentiment. Doing so might allow me to take part in different communities that dont' currently exist. Who knows. <br/><br/>Basically, I'd actually prefer a "pick-up" game night to last one and only one night, require no prep, and have great fun. I think that many, probably most, gamers would not identify that as their <i>preference</i>. They might do it and have fun, sure. But, I think that most gamers would dislike that as the "default" in place of their much preferred "let's start a campaign" way of playing. (Again, nothing wrong with either approach. But, "getting a game going" is a remarkable amount of effort. I'd prefer another route, particuarly given my lifestyle of full time dad, worker, friend, and part time grad student.)<br/><br/>2) Second, much more selfishly, I'm also very interested in figuring out how to get those people (as opposed to "gamers" necessarily) to purchase and play games I've published. That'd rock! And, I certainly hope that some of my publisher peers would like to know how to do the same thing. <br/><br/>So far, basically no one has pulled that off.

I haven't played a game over 4 sessions ever.<br/><br/>Here are some things that go on:<br/><br/>1.) Using local forums to organize games.<br/>2.) Having gaming groups that play different stuff depending on our mood and interests, rotating games each week.<br/>3.) Having gaming events in public ("Wayward Conventions") where people meet up, choose games, and play them.<br/>4.) Having freeform-scheduled Games on Demand, Indie Games Explosions, Story Game Lounges, etc at gaming conventions.<br/><br/>These all shift gaming to a more fluid and informal social space for me. The other night Daniel came over, we played Breaking the Ice, and then we went to see a movie. Awesome.<br/><br/>Games that have quick character creation, non-complicated mechanics, no requirement for setting knowledge... these all help.<br/><br/>Social spaces built around "let's talk about it, pick a game, and play it" mentality help big time.<br/><br/>And ultimately, saying "hey, why don't we just play a card game instead, tonight?" helps tons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155264/#Comment_155264" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T14:50:17+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  2:50PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>These all shift gaming to a more fluid and informal social space for me.

That's exactly the kind of approach I personally am working toward.<br/><br/>I've been in several situations very lately where the "Hey, let's just play cards" line happens literally. We just play cards instead. And, this is among some long time "gamers." It's fine with me; we have a great time. But, it's also telling to me. We're too tired and time-crunched to, say, roll up some D&amp;D characters and go nuts for the next 5 hours. It tells me something's amiss. I'm nearly certain we're still really jazzed about playing RPGs in ways we're not jazzed about playing cards. But, we perceive too many barriers, rightly or wrongly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155270/#Comment_155270" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T16:04:07+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  4:04PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>Or it's a very healthy signal that you're gathered together as friends foremost, and people who are gamers second. You realistically gage your energy levels, and decide that the energy-intensive act of roleplaying just isn't what you want at the moment. You let yourselves be at the level you are at, and as a result you aren't pushing yourselves into un-fun gaming sessions.<br/><br/>Like... my friend goes clubbing a lot. But sometimes he calls up his crew and says "you know, I'm going to sit this one out. You're welcome to come over and listen to me spin in my living room instead". That's a healthy expression of his ability to gage energy and treat his social activities as a single part of his identity, not an all-consuming, overriding thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst" title="zacharythefirst"><img alt="zacharythefirst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst">zacharythefirst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155291/#Comment_155291" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T19:56:29+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  7:56PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite><cite>Posted By: zacharythefirst</cite>It's just a part of the hobby--any hobby, really.</blockquote>\nThat's where I have to disagree, Zach. I spent years playing RPGs without feeling compelled to talk about those things. I'm not saying you shouldn't talk about them, but you're putting me in a box where I don't belong. And that is part of what some people are feeling.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a negative stereotype either, but I also disagree that it comes round to 'that D&amp;D stuff'. Obviously, it does if your paradigm<b>is</b>that D&amp;D stuff, but only then.<br/><br/>I'm just saying shop talk is appreciably part of any hobby--cars, golf, gaming, model trains-you name it.  I don't mean to say that everyone who's a golfer or gamer or whatever engages in it, but its there.  And I don't mean to box you in somewhere to where you don't belong, don't get me wrong--I'm just saying its the natural course of any hobby.<br/><br/>Interesting question (to me, anyhow):  do y'all think that other hobbies look at their shop talk and lingo as barriers or turn-offs to garnering more folks to their hobby?  I'm almost certain there's a faction in any hobby community that do.  Do you feel "shop talk" in RPGs does narrow the scope of social interaction?  Is it a bigger problem then it would be in another hobby, and if so, why?<br/><br/>If I'm getting too far away from base, I apologize, and will spin off from there, but I think it sort of ties in to the entire "gamer identification" discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155304/#Comment_155304" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T21:46:16+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  9:46PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2008 9:54PM by Moreno R..">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would gladly consider myself a gamer... if I liked the gamer culture we have now!<br/><br/>So, I don't think that there are two categories (people who want to consider himself a gamer, and people who don't) because this would mean considering the gamer culture we have now as a given, as inevitable, and the only one possible.<br/><br/>At the same time, I don't really believe in changing the actual gamer culture to make it more similar to the one I want, because (1) it would be impossible because (2) most gamer like their culture exactly like it is, and would reject the culture I want,<br/><br/>I would like another option.

When you can chatter to your co-workers using all the different TLAs and special terms used at that particular company, you feel more connected to those people.  I've been there, I've felt it.<br/>I'm sure most if not all hobbies have their specialized terms as well.  If I start jabbering about "d12s" and "THAC0" and crap like that to most people they'll have no idea what I'm talking about.  But most gamers will.<br/>That sense of "Heh, heh, I'm special because I know what all these arcane terms and expressions mean" can probably sometimes cause people to want to keep that specialized knowledge "secret."  Oh no!  If we introduce new people to gaming, all my bizarre knowledge will be more comon!  It will be less special, and therefore I will be less special for knowing about it!<br/><br/>Myself, I'm kind of on both sides of this.  I really enjoy being a part of obscure hobbies (and watching obscure movies and listening to obscure bands), partly BECAUSE they are obscure.  And I can recognize (and am somewhat disgusted by) my own pleasure in enjoying being aware of and knowledgeable about these little-known things.  At the same time, I often try to introduce new people to these things, because I like to share the joy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155454/#Comment_155454" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T12:28:31+00:00" title="July  8, 2008 12:28PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>Have you read my <a href="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/habits.html" rel="nofollow">Bad Teaching Habits</a> article?

I'd be interested to dive into the "social quality control" angle more (what's good, what's bad), and perhaps some examples--but only if you feel it doesn't derail here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155598/#Comment_155598" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T07:27:17+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  7:27AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zach, I'm good either way.
