They fall into two categories, as I understand it:<br/><br/>1. Conditions that describe what people perceive, but have no effect on what the character feels. "Slut", "Crybaby", "Meanie", "Doormat", and "Teacher's Pet" all fall into this category.<br/>2. Conditions that do have an effect on what the character feels, like "Drained" or "Terrified".<br/><br/>Conditions in the second category seem only to be valid when the rules specifically say something like "Get the Condition Drained". Do I have that right?<br/><br/>Do any of these Conditions ever cause a +1 or -1 modifier? I'd vaguely assumed that they all did all the time, but I was clearly wrong on that.<br/><br/>The book says, "No matter what, the highest bonus you can have on any given roll (counting both stat and forward) is 5." I note that this does not count Strings. I presume that this is deliberate. I also presume that one can burn as many Strings as one has on a character at a time. Is all of this correct? Did I miss a rule somewhere?<br/><br/>In theory, the Vampire feeds off other people. The Ghoul certainly needs to feed, one way or another. Neither Skin has any backstory on the order of "You've fed on someone. Take / Give X Strings". I presume that this is deliberate? Does one always presume that the Ghoul and Vampire have fed before the game starts and are feeding, or might one decide that they've never fed before the start of the game? (We noticed on a reread that these Skins are a little different than, say, the Selkie's, where someone has already stolen the pelt, or the Witch's, where the Witch has already acquired sympathetic tokens, or the Mortal, where the Mortal already has a True Love as part of the backstory.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409026/#Comment_409026" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-14T14:15:37+00:00" title="March 14, 2013  2:15PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>On conditions</b><br/><br/>Okay, so here's the thing and it's pretty much just a minor critique or flaw in the game.<br/><br/>Joe's said to me, while playing, 'Conditions shouldn't dictate an emotional state for a character.'<br/><br/>Except, there are a couple of moves, namely Gaze, where you do get an emotional state sorta dictated to you: 'Drained'. <br/><br/>Rather, as he writes 'It's best if it doesn't dictate an emotional state' on Page 28.<br/><br/>And, <i>when you take advantage of another PCs conditions</i>, you get +1.

I'm also wondering how flexible the Vampire is in play -- I mean, we don't have to do "sunlight kills" or "you need an invitation". Do Vampires have to feed off blood? Can they feed off intimacy?

It's very much a case of choose the characters problems based on the skin and then build the mythology for what they are around them.<br/><br/>With Conditions, I've found they sit around like forgotten luggage a lot of the time in play. We've also played (in a number of groups I've played with) that they are brought in to conflicts as a mechanical +1 against the character with the condition and are limited so can't be stacked and need to be relevant to the conflict. <br/><br/>When I run it I think I'm likely to routinely just re-assess them as we go along in a "yeah, you're not 'soaked through' any more" kind of way rather than "you're soaked through until you have the 'change into dry clothes' scene to remove the condition". It's something we've tended not to do and so you end up with a shopping list of badness attached to each character which often doesn't quite work with the fiction...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409122/#Comment_409122" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T10:29:11+00:00" title="March 15, 2013 10:29AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point about focusing on what's important about the Skin.

Dominates others through violence and intimidation.<br/><br/>* The Serpentine: a young vampire from an old dynasty, dealing with their family, a closed society hiding from the "outside world", jealously guarding their heritage<br/><br/>* The Chosen: a vampire who hunts other vampires, or otherwise uses vampire powers "for good" (e.g. the movie "Blade")<br/><br/>* The Queen or the Fae: a powerful older vampire who sits on a Council, makes deals, and orders people around - the spider in the centre of her web<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409175/#Comment_409175" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T15:46:50+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  3:46PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Conditions &amp; Emotional Autonomy</b><br/><br/>You should never apply a Condition to someone else that dictates their emotional state.

Can you do both at once? Um, no, probably not? I can't envision a "to do it, do it" scenario where that'd actually make sense.<br/><br/>Can you offer someone XP not to attack you, and then give them a -1 when they decide to attack you anyway? Yes. <br/><br/>Can you add +1 to your roll to lash out at someone, and then also add extra harm once the blow lands? Yes.<br/><br/>Can you "double up" on an effect?

All of this is true!<br/><br/>If you spend a String to offer XP, we need to see something happen between the characters. Even if it's just "Jessie gives you that puppy dog expression, his eyes darting toward the door. And I'm spending a String to offer you XP if you cover for him while he gets the fuck out of here." Since the players all have the history of that character-character relationship in their heads, the fiction that justifies a String getting spent can be fairly subtle. But there does need to be that link between the fiction and the mechanics.<br/><br/>When I MC, I like to ask, "Okay, what does that look like <b>on screen</b>?

I mean, he's usually got a soft touch about it, but he's still shutting people, especially Buffy, down. Actually, thinking again, if I were kicking off a game with Angel, I probably wouldn't take The Feeding as one of his starting moves, given drinking blood has little to do with his schtick for some time. <br/><br/>I'd pretty much say that just about every vampire example in fiction has Cold As Ice, to be honest. Maybe not the ones in 30 Days Of Night, but they're outside of Supernatural Teen Drama and well into Thriller/Horror. Still, I'd give them The Feeding and Inescapable, certainly, as well as probably Marked For The Hunt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409439/#Comment_409439" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T06:46:08+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  6:46AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Vampires are basically: you need to satisfy all my needs <i>because I'm pitiful</i>, I can't satisfy any of your needs <i>because it'd destroy you</i>, and you're not allowed to leave <i>because I'll kill you</i>.</blockquote>\nToo good, Joe!<br/><br/>(And, for the record, my players all got that from the Skin immediately.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409494/#Comment_409494" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T14:31:22+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  2:31PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Vampires are basically: you need to satisfy all my needs <i>because I'm pitiful</i>, I can't satisfy any of your needs <i>because it'd destroy you</i>, and you're not allowed to leave <i>because I'll kill you</i>.</blockquote>\nAh!

Those bits are designed to work a certain way; we don't necessarily want someone with a bunch of Strings to be able to kill someone with one roll, etc.<br/><br/>But why is it important to limit String use after a roll (for a +1 per String) to one-at-a-time?<br/><br/>The effect is that you can only benefit from spending Strings against another PC if you roll a 6 or a 9. For a PC with any stat in the starting range (-1 to +2), that means exactly 25% of the time. The rest of the time, you won't be able to improve your result.* Is that the intended effect?<br/><br/><br/><i>*: Of course, it's not quite as bad as 25%, since you'll never want to spend a String on a 10+ roll. But I can't estimate odds for that as easily, since it'll be different for each situation, depending on the stat's value. For instance, if your stat is 0, you won't want to spend a String after any 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8. You will want to use a String on a 6 or 9, and you won't need to use a String on a 10, 11, or 12.

Usually if they are in the homeroom then that's a yes! The card is where we can add details about them, strings and connections, and just physically move them around for relationship maps. When I'm scene framing I'll often grab the NPC card(s) of the folks in the scene and plonk them down on the table between me and the PC(s) involved, making it immediate and obvious who we are dealing with in the scene.<br/><br/>Drives (motivations) are usually as the rules say, simple and to the point. Simple is better, the players can complicate relationships all on their own.<br/><br/>as Joe says: <blockquote>Make your NPCs straightforward and obvious enough that the other players know how to react to them. Give them obvious goals and obvious means. And then make sure that their goals divide the PCs, pitting them against one another.... Whatever answer you get, trust it and build upon it. Add your own details to the answers that players give, and reincorporate whatever they say into future descriptions.... Play them recklessly, and play them knowing that they aren\u2019t going to last. If you do so, you\u2019ll have constant drama, constant sex, constant violence, and constant chaos. That\u2019s ideal.</blockquote>\nOne of my favourite things is to spend an NPC string and to come out of nowhere with a hard move. The string representing the emotional context for this move and forcing me to narratively justify my choice and allowing the NPC to surprise us all with their power to effect our player characters and emergent fiction.<br/><br/>What does it look like? Whatever makes sense in the story! The chapter on Villans has some good ideas for incorporating cravings and offerings and what they might look like as hard moves in the fiction. Generally I just scan my list as as you say, sometimes its as simple as having someone walk in at the wrong moment, whereas othertimes it may require a little foreshadowing or vignette of their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411849/#Comment_411849" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T09:50:35+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  9:50AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool.

Does this mean that if a Vampire feeds on another PC and does not select it, that PC dies? Is there any recourse? Does the person have to allow the feeding? I'd assume not, as it doesn't say so.<br/><br/>No roll is necessary to feed, correct? Or is that only true if the person being fed on does not resist?<br/><br/>I presume that this doesn't apply to ordinary animals -- that is, a vampire can feed on them, if folks agree, but this doesn't grant experience or allow for the above options -- or does it? Does it mean the animal might or might not die, but doesn't give the vampire any extra bennies?

So, if the person doing the Feeding doesn't choose "They don't die," and you don't want to die, erase all harm and then enter your darkest self or lose all strings. Then gain the condition drained, which is now super applicable. <br/><br/>For the feeding qua feeding, no roll, but depending on the situation, even assuming a willing victim, it could well be lashing out physically, or may the vampire has to hold steady to feed on his ex-girlfriend for the first time since they broke up, or maybe the vampire is feeding on the witch who has been a creepy seer the whole game and now has to let the darkness in, or perhaps it constitutes giving themselves to you after you turn them on. It's pretty situational.<br/><br/>Animal feeding, well, I'd make that a question to turn to the Vampire, but I'd probably load the shit out of that question with my own biases. "So, you feed on animals, huh? So, like, does it keep you going, but not /really/ sustain you the way human blood does, or do you start to take on traits of the animal? And on top of that, why does your vampy mother disapprove of the idea? What did she say you're going to do about it?" Or something else that sounded perfect in context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419222/#Comment_419222" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T04:39:54+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  4:39AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or make it out as a total disgusting thing.
