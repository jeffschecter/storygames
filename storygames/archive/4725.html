You may experience the misery of trying to feed a family on an apprentice's wage, or the fleeting thrill and notoriety of a daring criminal exploit. In the end, you will quite likely be hanged. Being hanged actually has the potential to be one of the best parts of this game, because it allows you to play a special set of scenes centered around your character.<br/><br/>What it\u2019s about:<br/><br/>The game is about the poor of London in the early industrial revolution as bracketed by a pair of historical facts: 1) most low-end trades did not earn enough to meet even basic expenses 2) the number of crimes for which one could be hanged ballooned from 50 to 255. <br/><br/>What I like about it:<br/><br/>The game comes with a lifepath list that looks like a glossary of obscure criminal (and non-criminal) trades, including \u201cmudlark\u201d (one who wades out into the river to knock coal of barges) and \u201cpure finder\u201d (one who gathers dog dung to sell to tanneries), which gives it a great sense of flavor. <br/><br/>What I really like is the story circuit structure. The game includes several story circuits, such as \u201cBroadsheet\u201d or \u201cPrison Break\u201d with a set sequence of scenes. The circuits have the potential to provide a very focused play experience, sort of like a Dogs town. The Poor and the Hanged has a bit of a \u201cDogs turned on its head\u201d feeling. This game isn\u2019t about the judges, but about the judged. A post-circuit discussion of some sort where players discuss how their characters were judged and what that means would be a good addition. <br/><br/>What it needs:<br/><br/>To be complete the game needs a good example of play. The resolution mechanics are kind of hard to follow in their current form. <br/><br/>The story circuits set out the flow of the story in rudimentary form, but I think it needs a bit more guidance on what form adversity should take. The setting and scene structure sets up adversity on an environmental level, but it\u2019s not clear what form this will take in the context of the individual scene. For example: the players are doing a \u201cGetting by\u201d scene. The situation is that a lower class citizen can\u2019t possibly make enough at a simple trade to pay for food and lodging. So how do I turn this general circumstance into the situation for a particular scene? In a complete game, I\u2019d like to see guidance on how I turn a general story circuit into my groups own interpretation of it.<br/><br/>Some questions and opinions:<br/><br/>Some trades look better than others. Should I just choose the best ones?<br/>I want my character not to commit any crimes. Does the game support this play? How?<br/>Should there be a way to lose quirks, use them up, or render them temporarily un-usable? It seems like you could end up accumulating a lot of quirks\u2013far more than you could ever use. Maybe when used a quirk is used up for that circuit.<br/>Why do you need a moderator, and what are their duties? Are they a traditional GM?<br/><br/>Final Opinion<br/><br/>I'd love to see this game advanced towards a complete design. I think there's something here that I haven't seen in any other game. The mechanics as written are far from clear to me, but it looks like you're aiming for a quick resolution with a few steps that moves the story ahead. This seems right on target to me. It seems like you could complete a game of this in a night, which is an attractive idea.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106555/#Comment_106555" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T13:05:45+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  1:05PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds cool.<br/><br/>It sounds like there's a lot of structure and closed circuits, but still some really interesting choices and flexibility within that.<br/><br/>The idea of choosing which circuits you travel, as well as a lifepath system, allows a customizable progression.

Should I just choose the best ones?</i> - one option would be to create a stronger life-path feel by having each trade graduate to a subset of trades rather than letting players choose at will- so you would take a more basic or weaker seeming one to get one of the more weird/potent. Another possibility- draw cards for them randomly. Third option- take whichever interest you. Another question is whether I should sort them by gender- luckily a lot of these overlap since women and men and children were all out selling stuff and getting by<br/><i>I want my character not to commit any crimes. Does the game support this play? How?</i> Maybe. you could play circuits so that your character is falsely accused/ arrested - I guess I could think about a law-abiding circuit on the economy/society side of the game, maybe with a stop observing a hanging<br/><i>Should there be a way to lose quirks, use them up, or render them temporarily un-usable? It seems like you could end up accumulating a lot of quirks\u2013far more than you could ever use. Maybe when used a quirk is used up for that circuit.</i> My sense of the economy of the cards is that you will need to draw on quirks a lot to have a chance of winning so I probably wouldn't limit them per circuit. So maybe I could add more to the 'fallout' between circuits so you lose some quirks that way<br/><i>Why do you need a moderator, and what are their duties? Are they a traditional GM?</i> I guess I was thinking to play and roleplay for the opposition and minor characters. It may depend on how scenes are created- does a moderator have any role pre-seeding content or do does there just need to be someone (a mod or a player not active in that scene) to draw cards for the opposition<br/><br/>And a big YES to being interested in you running a playtest. I'll probably try it myself to make sure it's worth the effort- then I'll be in touch<br/><br/>thanks again<br/><br/>mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
