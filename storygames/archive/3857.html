My gaming over the past year or so has mainly been 1-3 session pickup games with a rotation group of players, and the 4x a year minicons in Oakland.<br/><br/>When I got back into role-playing in 2006, I didn't want the (safety?) of a re-occuring private group and a long campaign.  I wanted to play through the highlights of the indie gaming catalog.  And I played satisfying sessions of MLWM, TMW, DitV, Contenders, BWR, SotC and perhaps less satisfying games of some other games.  But I played a lot and learned a lot.<br/><br/>I have three main possibilities for where to spend my playing time now.  Somehow in my heart I feel like combination of a short campaign to satisfy my need for a regular group and continuing to explore lots of short-form games with one-shots will be satisfying for me in the next year.<br/><br/>The 500 pound gorilla is a Burning Wheel campaign.  I want to play it more and want to run a successful short campaign.  The rules really speak to me and I think I can tell some great stories along with the players.  But it's still a little intimidating to me.  I did get The Blossoms are Falling yesterday and it intrigues me quite a bit.<br/><br/>Also, there's still a number of unplayed indie releases on my shelf.  Some recent and some a little older.  Dust Devils in particular really attracts me given the Western tropes and simple story-based mechanics.  But I've read through some others and some don't really excite me.<br/><br/>And lastly, there are an amazing amount of unpublished games out there that want to get playtested.  Game Chef alone created dozens of games, some of which are quite good.  I would be very picky about the unpublished games and find something that suited my genre interests and/or playing style.  I'm not so much into fantasy and BW has been the exception.<br/><br/>So what do you think I should be playing now?  Why?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86550/#Comment_86550" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T11:17:55+00:00" title="August  8, 2007 11:17AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>The Pool, of course.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86554/#Comment_86554" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T11:25:59+00:00" title="August  8, 2007 11:25AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>The Pool, of course.</blockquote>\nWhy?

Primarily utilized for the second edition star wars game (non wizards of the coast / tsr), the d6 system is one of the simplest and most versatile systems around. It is flawless, completely customizable, and only uses d6 which are easily gotten. Another fantastic system that is far more complex, and forces you to adhere to a single campaign setting, is the second edition of Shadowrun. It also uses d6 primarily, for a slightly different feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87000/#Comment_87000" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T11:41:50+00:00" title="August  9, 2007 11:41AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23859.0" rel="nofollow">Here is a discussion of a game using my 'Miniseries Event' format</a> (some adult content).
