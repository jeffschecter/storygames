If every player spends about 100$ in games per year, we have a 660'000$ market size. This is totally made up without ANY evidence, except for the 66 gamechef games.<br/><br/>Are most of the buyers people from this forum or is there a significant % of random people/players that pick up story games?<br/><br/>I am interested in your guesstimations!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353146/#Comment_353146" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T16:34:40+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  4:34PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2012 8:18AM by Mathalus.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ivan, this is an awesome question, full of analytical fun.

I think that's common - that only one or two group members are represented in the online sphere.<br/><br/>Most of the people who buy my games don't have names I recognize from participating in the S-G community for 5 years. That leads me to assume that this forum is only a small part of "our market."<br/><br/>At large conventions, I've played (and sold) lots of story games with folks who'd previously only done traditional gaming, or who had stories like, "Mostly I play D&amp;D, but we do love us some InSpectres. Oh, and I've tried Dirty Secrets and Poison'd, but I don't know what I think about them. Mostly, just D&amp;D." So I think that any dividing lines we draw between "our players" and "trad players" are artificial and erroneous.<br/><br/>I have moderate success pitching story games (whether playing them or selling them) to non-gamers. Others (esp. the Olympia and Portland crew) have seen lots of success in that endeavor as well. So I think "our market" is open-ended. We have the potential to create new story gamers, and to cross-pollinate between different hobby communities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353163/#Comment_353163" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T18:50:04+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  6:50PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2012 2:55PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a fun question.

(probably for jenskot) how many tabletop role players are there?  and what would that number comprise?

By "market" I assume you're talking about buyers.<br/><br/>The configuration and price of your game will certainly have an impact on the size of the market. Cheap games don't necessarily sell more copies than expensive games. Some folks buy multiple copies for convenience: I've got three copies of BW Gold and two copies of Burning Empires, but only one copy of Mouse Guard (never got a box). Some stuff sells to readers who will never play, completists, collectors, etc.<br/><br/>You could put together pretty much any formula you wanted to justify any number you wanted. Seems like 300ish is easy to hit for a sub-$20 hardcopy product. Seems like breaking 10k copies for a $20+ hardcopy product is a tough nut to crack. That's a lot of room in the middle and a lot of range in pricing. <br/><br/>I'll bet Bret will sell at least 200 copies of The Final Girl at, what, $10 apiece? If it had killer full-color artwork at twice the price I'll bet he'd sell at least twice as many. Might get doubled again if a horror-oriented website or two talked about it. Where are those numbers coming from? My butt.<br/><br/>I am astonished that Apocalypse World has sold less than 1500 copies. I have to think it's because it isn't "easy" to buy. Is it on Amazon (just looked, nope)? RPGNow, the "leading source of indie rpgs" (maybe -- there's one lumpley product and it's "adult content" I have to be logged in to see)? IPR (nope!)? Vincent's chosen distro method has to impact the sales far more than the possible universe of buyers.<br/><br/>My gut, based on the 80/20 rule: probably 100,000 people worldwide with some interest in the style, 20,000 of whom ever spend money. That 20k audience has lots of crossovers but nobody inside of it actually buys everything that's independently published.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353180/#Comment_353180" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T21:08:15+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  9:08PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2012 9:27PM by lumpley.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Somebody oughta doublecheck that they're reading my numbers correctly!<br/><br/>1431 is the number of direct online sales I made in 2011, all games.

I know this seems absolutely crazy to most of my savvy friends but the average gamer doesn't spend time online reading about RPGs (outside of maybe their favorite game, and even then only occasionally).<br/><br/>My publisher friends have experimented selling games through different outlets at different times in different orders with minimal variation.  People who are used to buying directly from designers, buy direct. People who are used to buying from their local store, do so, even if it is a little cheaper online. There are people who only buy from RPG Now or Paizo. Some people, even those with smart phones and know how to use Google, won't ever hear about your game unless it is in their local store.<br/><br/>Even if someone likes Story Games, if your game isn't available in the places they typically buy, the chances they will buy your game seems low. There are caveats.<br/><br/>Caveat 1: even if the above is true for you, it still may not be worth your time selling through different outlets depending on your goals.<br/><br/>Caveat 2: I suspect this will change as technology advances.<br/><br/>Caveat 3: Most of the above is based on research from the sales teams of RPG publishers I'm friends with, but I would guess this info is about 2-3 years old.<br/><br/>The main point is that even if you can calculate the Story Games market, it's likely not in one easy to reach place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353221/#Comment_353221" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-05T11:38:14+00:00" title="January  5, 2012 11:38AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rustbelt's sales have been 90% (that's a rough guess, but it's the overwhelming majority) to people in Europe that don't post on SG or the Forge (one of them told me he heard of it by reading an inspirational account of someone else's campaign on a German (maybe?

In our case, the effect that had the most impact was the concept of the network externality. For TRPGs, the \u201ctrue value\u201d of the product is not in the book/box that you buy. It is in the network of social connections that you share which enable you to play the game. Without that social network, the game\u2019s value is massively reduced (it becomes literature, and there\u2019s a small market for people who like to just read and never play TRPG content).<br/><br/>We began to view the market not as a series of product pyramids (a core book at the top, and an ever-broadening base of support materials produced over time), but instead as a series of human webs that overlapped and interconnected. Where those webs were strong, the products flourished. Where they were weak, the products failed. The limiting factor to the growth and strength of the TRPG market was not retail stores or shelf space, it was human brains within which these games could interconnect.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353235/#Comment_353235" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-05T13:26:06+00:00" title="January  5, 2012  1:26PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2012 1:30PM by Marshall Burns.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ivan,<br/>Those European sales are divided roughly half-and-half between the Paypal button on my personal website and the one on the Unstore.

This is the vast majority of the product, very few indie rpgs have a marketing drive or a hook that causes them to rise above the flock in our store. In practice this means that the only meaningful sales data I can provide is a trifold classification into hits, solid slows and weak products; our store represents a goodly fraction of the product field, but the sales per product are so slow that it's statistically meaningless to make more exact comparisons than that. (In case anybody cares, the difference between a solid and a weak product lies in long tail viability: things that nobody wants two years after publication are weak, and usually not something I want to represent, while the slow/solid stuff is exactly what my store is for.)<br/><br/>The Finnish market for story games is something like 200 people who buy things systematically, with about 10 times that playing and/or making random purchases. This accounts for maybe 10-20% of the roleplayer population in the country, depending largely on how you define this nebulous term. Sales outlets are online stores, us and a couple brick-and-mortar stores, with sales perhaps being split pretty evenly between the three. The population of the country is an ample 5 million people, but I wouldn't generalize the statistics elsewhere - the popularity or lack thereof of a new trend in gaming is very random in Finland due to the network effects mentioned; for example, the influence of trendsetters like myself, Olli Kantola or Sami Koponen (to list a few neophilic and visible Finnish gamers) is disproportionately large in an internally well-connected but internationally somewhat distant culture like ours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353290/#Comment_353290" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-06T08:12:58+00:00" title="January  6, 2012  8:12AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent's sales aren't really that comparable to other people's and, as I recall, Forge Booth sales are only really significant if you have a new product out that year.
