We kept the core of the game \u2013 using \u2018truth or dare\u2019 and seeing if a combination two characters\u2019 cards allow them to hook up \u2013 but altered the procedures and clarified how players narrate. With these changes, the game  \u2026 worked, better than I had anticipated for a game about the \u2018sociology and psychology\u2019 of teen sex - at least as far as one run-through could clarify. <br/><br/>Of course, three players of the same gender who are familiar with one another\u2019s gaming styles may not be the best test subjects for a game about a sensitive topic. As we started, Judson asked if it was a game for teens abut sex or a game for adults about teen sex. The latter \u2013 although there is nothing system wise that limits it to teen characters. We never got explicit in narrating \u2013 there was usually build up then a couple of lines of post mortem of the encounter that implied how things went. This worked well, at least for us. <br/><br/>In the game players choose what 4 cliques the characters will be members of. We picked mormons, punks, LGBT, and PETA and drew cards to see what clique each of our 3 characters was part of and what their status would be (suit and value of face up card). Because of the LDS clique, Judson had two characters who were brothers and Josh had one of their cousins.  The mormon + punk + teen sex tension was a good driver for the game as it led to some sibling rivalry, repressed homosexuality, young marriage proposals, switching cliques to LDS to go straight, etc. <br/><br/>Our set of nine characters then proceeded to ask each other awkward questions (truths) and dare one other to hit on other characters. To hook up, characters need to be:<br/>\u2022\tsame clique<br/>\u2022\twithin 3 status of each other<br/>\u2022\topposite gender<br/>\u2022\tone char needs to have a higher heart card in hand than the other char\u2019s highest club card<br/>\u2022\tat least spade card (logistical opportunity) between the 2 chars<br/>\u2022\ta diamond card can overcome one obstacle<br/><br/>Our main rules trouble shooting challenge as we played was better incentives for players to choose truth over dare (or disincentives for dares). As written, dares provided more information about other players\u2019 cards and provided a stronger narrative outcome than did truth scenes. We eventually decided that truth scenes should be the only way to get rid of bad cards (high clubs, basically) and a way to draw a new card (looking for a spade, diamond, or high heart). <br/><br/>To support this change, characters will no longer get a free card after every character has had a turn. I\u2019m also leaning towards three other suggestions that we didn\u2019t have a chance to try: not removing half of the spades and diamond cards before the game; having characters lose diamond cards (and maybe also spade cards) after they are used to successfully hook up with another character; and have diamonds only overcome the first three, visible, obstacles \u2013 not the need for spade cards and a heart card greater than opposing club. <br/><br/>Some changes we made early in play were to make all actions based on a specific character rather than a player and to play until every character has hooked up at least once (or 3-4 turns each- like the years of high school). We also decided that the card drawn by each player involved in a successful dare would determine their reaction to the encounter- and therefore color the narration. We figured out that successful dares are narrated in alternating single sentences, started with the player whose character was dared (pursued the other character)- as if being written in a journal or told to a friend. I wish we had recorded some of these exchanges. They flowed naturally and were entertainingly awkward and biting and/or clueless, depending on the tone each player was going for. <br/><br/>Failed dares are narrated by the player whose character was asked out in a single or a few sentences like schoolyard gossip on why their character rejected the asking character. <br/><br/>A couple of options worth trying out next time:<br/>* number of characters. Draft has 3 per player but to avoid too many, maybe 4-6 players could have 2 chars each and 7 plus have one char each. Incidentally Judson suggested that the game could work as a werewolf/ mafia kind of game with a bunch of players standing around, holding their cards so everyone could only see the face card that indicates clique and status. <br/>* \u2018slumming.\u2019 A higher status char could ignore the need for a date to be within 3 status \u2013 but this would put their reputation at risk so if they hook up, the card they get would automatically become their new status/clique card if is the same suit or same value as their existing face card.<br/>* Encourage uncertain dares. The char who dares two other chars gets a free card if the pairing fails by just one obstacle (an incentive to encourage players not to always go for dares that they are sure will succeed or fail).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178924/#Comment_178924" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T21:51:22+00:00" title="November 16, 2008  9:51PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Mark.

Yes, a same gender pairing is always an obstacle that takes a diamond card to bypass. In our game, the one character who was part of the LGBT clique only hooked up with girls. To balance things, we also tried some straight guy - straight guy dares. Anyway, I'll probably keep this rule as a reflection of existing discrimination.<br/><br/>mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178970/#Comment_178970" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T08:53:12+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  8:53AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The notion of actions requiring an override, purely from a mechanical point of view, looks to work out nicely, from what I'm seeing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
