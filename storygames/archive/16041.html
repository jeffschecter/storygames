It's okay, but without a little work and some sauce, not much in the way of flavor.Most everyone can make it, and it is often people's first foray into gaming. The staple of college students.<br/><br/>GURPs would be rice. Even less flavor than D&amp;D, and you're more likely to screw the game up and get burned. Has some die-hard fans and about a billion ways to prepare it.<br/><br/>Shadowrun would be steak. Lots of flavor, lots of stuff to tear into, but only a few variations on the main flavor. Even if you screw up and get burned, it might work.<br/><br/>Kobolds Ate My Baby would be a bag of chips and some beer. A good way to have some fun, but nothing in the way of depth.<br/><br/>7th Sea would be Fish and Chips. There's really only one main flavor, but it's a good one. With a little preparation, it can be fantastic.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu would be Thai Food. If it's really good, you'll have to run screaming from the room and shit your pants. Lots of flavor, but you can't play it too much.<br/><br/>Deadlands is beef chili. The flavor is good, and even if you burn it you will probably enjoy it. However,occasionally you may make a batch which makes you shit your pants.<br/><br/>Wushu would be popcorn with movie butter. You can convince yourself it is good for you, it has GREAT flavor, and it is easy to do. Sometimes you wonder why you don't have it more often.<br/><br/>Toon would be a bag of Lucky Charms.Its a game with a lot of flavor that everyone seems to love, if only for the special bits.<br/><br/>Paranoia would a 6-pack of beer, and you're trying to see who can chug it down the fastest.<br/><br/>White Wolf's games are frozen dinners.There are a lot of different flavors, and it can range from\u201cactually, that was really good\u201d to \u201cwow I can't believe I put that in my mouth,\u201d but they all have that same angsty aftertaste,and if you eat nothing else chances are good you have no real friends.<br/><br/>The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron M\xfcnchhausen is a bottle of wine. Lots of flavor, having it is really simple, but it isn't quite a real rpg.<br/><br/>RIFTs is a cheese sampler platter that you make yourself. Ultimately, how rich and developed the flavor of the game will be is dependent on your choices, and it is frankly so much work that most people won't bother.<br/></blockquote>\nWhat other RPGs food are there?<br/><br/>Has this been done before?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365622/#Comment_365622" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T00:27:14+00:00" title="March  7, 2012 12:27AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vulpinoid</cite>Call of Cthulhu would be Thai Food.
