Adventure. Disco. (Leisure suit not included)<br/><br/>Spectrum Games is proud to announce the release of the Lightspeed Adventure Manual (LAM), a \u201cpay what you want\u201d PDF that offers a stripped-down, but fully playable, version of the Retrostar system. Retrostar is a roleplaying game that faithfully emulates the science fiction TV shows of the 1970s. <br/><br/>Lead designer Barak Blackburn says, \u201cThis isn't your father's ironic, polyester game system. Retrostar has been crafted to be a fully-integrated game designed specifically for 1970s sci-fi, though, Spectrum is looking into adapting it for some other genres. Inside, you will not find a generic sci-fi system, instead you will find a game that captures all the coolest moments from favorites like Battlestar Galactica, The Six Million Dollar Man, Land of the Lost and every other uniquely groovy sci-fi TV series from the far-out past!\u201d<br/><br/>In addition to all the rules needed to play, the LAM contains a ready-to-play series, complete with setting information, pre-generated characters and a full episode to kick off your adventures with! The series is called R\u014dgun. In this setting, the earth has been ravaged, her resources depleted. Noble warriors defend a mobile, solar-powered fortress, traveling from town to town. These rollerskating Samouri stand against the Warriors of the Night and cybornetic Scroungers.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the LAM contains all the rules you\u2019ll need in order to play Retrostar, it is not the full rulebook. It is a quick-play PDF designed to let new players jump right into the action and, as such, is available for absolutely no cost to you. However, we have made it a \u201cpay what you want\u201d product, with any money paid going toward increasing the production values of the full rulebook.  <br/><br/>You can download the LAM here: <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/141873/Retrostar--Lightspeed-Adventure-Manual-QuickPlay" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/141873/Retrostar--Lightspeed-Adventure-Manual-QuickPlay</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
