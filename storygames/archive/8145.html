Of course, I myself use an opt-in email list for this sort of thing, not being a jerk and all. The rest of the commercial field seems to think that it's perfectly OK to send marketing spam to anybody who gave you their contact information for any reason whatsoever.<br/><br/>My personal reaction would be positive in this case, but that's just because I've met you and am interested in what you're up to. Without this relationship I'd start fuming and end up with denial of service attacks on your server if you made the mistake of repeating the spamming one too many times. At the very least I'd scour the net for all your related contact info and submit it to a couple dozen porn spam lists just to make sure you'd get the good ol' Hammurabi x 1000 treatment. Probably send Jehova's witnesses to your door too, for good measure; there's no such thing as over-reacting when it comes to unsolicited marketing countermeasures. We'll never be rid of it if we start molly-codling the bastards.<br/><br/>Also, my reaction would be completely different if your email said something like "Hey, I forgot to ask you this when you bought my stuff: would you mind if I sent you information about a related product I have in the pipeline, effectively adding you to my customer mailing list? It's a low-volume private list I only use to keep folks abreast of my rpg design endeavours, won't be more than a couple of messages per year. Thank you." I won't firebomb your car just because you ask courteously to have the permission to add me to a marketing database you forgot to ask about earlier. I might not say yes, but asking never hurt anybody.<br/><br/>Lastly, opt-out is not the same as opt-in. The burden of gathering a database of willing audience is on you, and even requiring somebody to mail you to get out of your list is wrongful imposition on somebody who has never asked for your marketing. I never answer opt-out solicitations, preferring to report the offending marketer to consumer protection agencies where they're brazen enough to spam me with a verifiable identity. This is all the more so when you consider the fact that opt-out clauses are so much dead weight in any criminal spamming operation; they're not going to remove you from their lists just because you ask them to, if they were willing to send you unsolicited mail to begin with.<br/><br/>In summation: I recommend that instead of writing a marketing message with an opt-out clause, you should write a message asking a permission to add the person into your marketing database, after which you can send them the marketing message. This turns your opt-out into an opt-in, effectively, as those who are not interested can just delete your message and forget the whole thing. And when you send your actual marketing material, you can then be sure to have it only go to people who gave you a permission to prod them with it. This is probably excessive in 90% of your market interactions so far, but the fact that most of your customers consider you an interesting acquaintance doesn't mean shit to that 10% who bought stuff from you with the impression that you're doing it professionally. Better learn to work with good business practice from the start, unless you're very committed to shaping your activity into something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179169/#Comment_179169" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T12:16:15+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 12:16PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Why did they give you their email in the first place?

A more sophisticated marketer would have included an option to be placed on the mailing list at purchase time, but I'm just barely reaching that level of sophistication now. So yes, these are unsolicited emails. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I'm not sure I'd accept the characterization "spam". In my mind there's a big difference between receiving a message (however unwelcome) from someone I've done business with in the past, and receiving a message from someone I've never had a relationship with regarding a product I've never expressed any interest in.

I send similar messages about mailing logistics and other such practical issues of the order as well, and could well imagine adding something about a mailing list if I decided to start one. There's a big difference in having somebody contact you personally to request your interaction and being the recipient of bulk mail.<br/><br/>I agree that IPR databases are tricky in this regard. I suppose I'd find the one opt-in message approach appropriate in that as well, just like David describes. I'd have to find out what practices IPR has spam-wise, though, as the customer might already be miffed at them having sent him a bunch of junk mail at that point - better not associate myself with their indiscretion, if they happen to do that sort of thing. IPR being essentially an independent webstore in the aspects that suit it makes this as tricky as it is: I suppose that nobody here would consider lifting a customer database from Leisure Games and using it to send mail to people who've bought their product, to pick an example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179180/#Comment_179180" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T12:40:49+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 12:40PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion is moving faster than I can track, so if I leapfrog your response, my apologies.<br/><br/>Eero, your answer is very good and thought-out.

You are a friend (or, at the very least, someone I know) that sends me an email.<br/><br/>In the general case, if you did not have a specific "opt-in" checkbox in the first place you should not send emails. <br/>If you have a very good reason to send them, and you simply forgot the opt-in stuff, just send a first email, keeping it short, asking to reply if the person receiving it is willing to opt-in, excusing yourself for the unsolicited communication.<br/><br/>Unlike Finland, in Italy you can technically[*] be fined at least 500EUR for a single unsolicited commercial email, just for the Privacy Authority to open the case. Obviously if you're not in Italy it does not really matter, but I mention it just to underline how different the expectations of people can be. Italian firms cannot contact you, unless you opted in (which many make mandatory to acquire the service, obviously), and if contacted requiring your name to be canceled they have to do it or face harsher fines.

This is true even if I didn't purchase their game. Yes, you (generic 'you' to include any and all authors of indie/small-press/S-G games) may consider this an opt-in to add me to any e-mail lists for this sort of thing that you'd like. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf WotC were to e-mail me to buy their newest Eberron supplement, I would probably be annoyed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is a matter of scale. I'm pretty sure that if Planet Thirteen Games was to contact me, that it would be the real Tony or a close associate writing the e-mail. If I were to get an e-mail from Keith-Baker@wotc.com I wouldn't have any real belief that Keith had even the foggiest idea who I am, let alone was actually e-mailing me. I don't even think he'd be the one actually writing the e-mail, though it isn't impossible. It's the difference between faceless corporation and dude who wrote a cool game. Tony Dowler and Keith Baker are both dudes who write cool games, but one of them writes his own e-mails to customers where the other probably has people who do that for him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179240/#Comment_179240" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T16:58:48+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  4:58PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome to my spamming list, Lance.<br/><br/>(Damn, now I need to start one.)<br/><br/>Also, I agree with your finangling of the motivational landscape - pretty similar ultimate causes rule my own annoyance. That doesn't pertain to how I wish people would act, though; I think it's important that even if I wouldn't be personally annoyed by indie spam in practice, these people should still hold to good business practices. The fact that the girl might welcome you groping her doesn't really justify doing it without asking her first, to coin a comparison. This is true even if you belong to a subculture where groping is encouraged, at least if the subculture is open and you can't really for sure know if she's a member as well. And I dearly hope that being a customer of an indie publisher is not some sort of subculture membership that justifies treating you differently from other commercial relationships you might have. As long as there's not EULA for Story Games where you give up certain commercial rights or something like that, we need to assume as publishers that a given customer won't identify themselves as a member of the big happy family where everybody spams everybody else with impunity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179241/#Comment_179241" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T17:31:58+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  5:31PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, typically when you purchase something online from a larger retailer they have TOS (terms of service) that you are agreeing to after you (hopefully) reads the terms. In there they often specify that they will email you with special offers and/or coupons. And those emails need to have an opt-out feature where you can just click a link or send an email to not get any more emails from them.<br/><br/>Smart online retailers have checkmarks on their "buy" page that say something like "Would you like to receive periodic updates on new products, blah blah..." to make it easy for you to make a decision. Usually those checkmarks default ON.<br/><br/>Now notice I said the <i>retailer</i> and not the <i>developer</i> of a product.  Online retailers try very hard to grow and protect their email address list. So if you sell a book on Amazon for instance, they are going to get the email address, not you.<br/><br/>So if you are looking to start an email list of existing and potential customers (which you should!), add a link to let people on your site opt-in to get the occasional email from you. You might sweeten up the pot by offering something free in exchange. Like say a sample pdf of For the Love of Dungeons or maybe a dungeon that you didn't include in the book.<br/><br/>Just grabbing emails you got from PayPal and using them for anything other than correspondence about the order seems like bad juju to me if you have no TOS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179242/#Comment_179242" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T17:35:39+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  5:35PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I strongly recommend looking at rpgnow's various e-mail signups.
