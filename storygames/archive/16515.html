You play the game, each character has a name, and an identity, and a conflict, and a goal, and all the other players have characters.<br/><br/>BUT.<br/><br/>You are playing Joey, a schoolteacher who discovers that his wife is sleeping with his best friend. And you're freaking out because the news says that terrorists are going to attack the city today, the threat level is magenta or whatever.<br/><br/>And the player next to you is playing Susan, a starship pilot living on a space station. She's been cheating on her husband with another pilot. Also, the Xevuron fleet is supposed to launch their tactical offensive soon, so everyone's on edge.<br/><br/>And player three is Augustus, a vampire lord who has seduced his rival's woman, a half-ghast Bloodtainter. Also, the sun's coming up and the peasants have pitchforks, so that's kind of a hassle.<br/><br/>And the three players go through this scene, and a couple others, but they keep the details vague, and at the end, each person has a resolution -- but then they compare notes and find out each was living through a different story! Kind of.<br/><br/>I don't know. Now that I'm typing it up, I'm not sure that this makes any sense, or has any value to it. It was inspired by this one episode of the X-Files, which probably was inspired by Rashomon, but whatever, anyhow, the idea is that everyone has a different take on what happened, and the truth comes out after play...<br/><br/>Hmm.

It seems like the key struggle would be to make sure that play itself isn't confusing and mismatched. I can conceive of a game where I'm the Vampire Lord, and I don't know that the character to my left, Susan, is a starship pilot. But how would that not manifest itself in play as all kinds of in-character confusedness?<br/><br/>The difficulty is that, in roleplaying, the story is live, now, and the story and the characters and the mental images we have get really nebulous if we can't all agree on what's happening. What you want to do is play with that nebulousness. In my experience, the game is not fun if it's nebulous. I'm not saying it can't be done, but that's the difficulty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378274/#Comment_378274" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T14:40:00+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  2:40PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few months back I posted a game for Games Galore, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=364062" rel="nofollow">Speechless</a> which is designed to do exactly this.

At least, I can't picture making that work, but I would be interested in doing more of this on a smaller scale.  Rather than having the entire world be different, I might start with an important feature.  <br/><br/>There is an intriguing pre-written scenario that I've been thinking of running but haven't yet where there is a team of PCs with different specialties and personalities.  All of the players except for the leader know that they are really multiple personalities of a single talented individual.  The scenario goes through a bunch of issues, with the leader going back and forth coordinating among the different specialists to get things done - and dealing with their various personalities quirks.  So to one player it is a drama about dealing with a team of ill-fitting, opinionated specialists - while to the others it is about an isolated, talented man struggling with his various facets.  (I'm avoiding specifics and spoilers about this deliberately.)  <br/><br/>I haven't done this or really anything close.  Some other possible inspirations might include films like Fight Club and Identity.  <br/><br/>Still, I do think it can be interesting and fun to give descriptions that players apply different interpretations to.  For example, in one campaign for several sessions, I had some scenes with the GM where I said "I change into my hideous demon form" - in situations where the other PCs were not around, and did things like meeting with the invading demon army to negotiate/spy.  I think most of the players pictured it as some terrible beast or such - but in this case, my character was a flamboyantly gay man, and I had secretly agreed with the GM that my demon form was a shapely succubus (aka "Bat-winged Bimbo from Hell").  Even though they heard my scenes openly, the other players were picturing something significantly different from what I was.  I think it made for interesting re-thinking when they first encountered the form face to face.  <br/><br/>I just GMed "Monsters and Other Childish Things" yesterday, and it occurs to me that if I ran it again, there are a lot of possibilities of varying realities that are being described.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378288/#Comment_378288" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T15:43:18+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  3:43PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafael,<br/><br/>sounds like a larp to me. <i>Any</i> larp, in theory at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378289/#Comment_378289" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T15:52:25+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  3:52PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure if this is helpful, but I was put in mind of a teacher training exercise I did a few years back.<br/><br/>The presenter handed out index cards to everyone in the audience.  Mine was blank.  He said "Do nothing except what is written on your card," and then he started listing words.<br/><br/>Sun<br/>Blanket<br/>Ants<br/>Frisbee<br/><br/>...and he went on, but I can't remember any more of the words.  When he finished he asked us all to write down as many words as we could remember.  Obviously, I didn't remember very many words.  Some people, however, remembered almost all of them.  So how does this relate to the original post?  My index card was blank, but not everyone's was.  One third of the room had cards that read "Remember the words that I say; you'll have to write them down later."  The final third of the room had cards that read almost the same, but with one key addition: "Remember the words that I say - they all related to picnics. You'll have to write them down later."  We all sat through the same events, but we had very different experiences.  Could this be used in a game?  I don't know, but if it could I would really enjoy playing it; that exercise was pretty mind bending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378473/#Comment_378473" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T11:58:10+00:00" title="May 15, 2012 11:58AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with starting with a single element than trying to cross genres.

The main issue being (as mentioned) making the scene-by-scene play fun, rather than just kind of a slog that leads up to the really awesome reveal.<br/><br/>The most obvious approach to me would be to add an additional frame in which the majority of the roleplaying takes place -- so you have X realities, where X = the number of players + 1. And the +1 is the shared world that everybody starts out mostly playing in, with each character's true reality either known to players or not, known to characters or not, bleeding constantly into the shared reality or not, etc. Adding a shared layer opens up many more possibilities for playing with the bleed and incomprehension and 'aha!' reveals without completely comprimising the coherence of immediate scene-to-scene play. Characters could have special abilities or knowledge based on their 'real' frame of reference, or there could be specific scenes or places in the shared reality that act as miniature reveals or nightmarish reality-bleeds relating to the characters. And then of course the various reveal cards for the PCs could all operate off a shared set of reference points in the central narrative.<br/><br/>Then maybe you could call it 'The Big Model'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378513/#Comment_378513" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T13:58:28+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  1:58PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2012 1:58PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite>Rafael,<br/><br/>sounds like a larp to me.<i>Any</i>larp, in theory at least.</blockquote>\nIt sounds a lot like larp to me as well.<br/><br/>The game that I know of that has done this sort of thing better than any other is <a href="http://www.interactivitiesink.com/larps/mary.html" rel="nofollow">.The Final Voyage Of The Mary Celeste</a>.

So the context would make sense.<br/><br/>And you could do a couple of keywords, maybe. I'd intuitively guess that 3 would be the most anyone could be expected to mentally juggle, but I'd want to test it to see if you could even reasonably get that high. I assume that the dissonance of having others not quite mean the same thing would greatly reduce the ability to translate in your head effectively and the task would get exponentially more difficult the more players with different meanings and the more words you had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachlan" title="lachlan"><img alt="lachlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachlan">lachlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378557/#Comment_378557" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T18:41:02+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  6:41PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2012 6:42PM by lachlan.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out Ship of Fools.

So you're playing Joey having a scene where you play out a conversation with someone playing your wife Susan.  Except that you think you're a schoolteacher and she's a bus driver, while she think she's a starship pilot and you're a robotics developer.  So you're going ahead and having conversations talking about your marriage and work, but using names and/or key words rather than descriptive details.  (i.e. Joey the robotics developer might talk about the robots as his "kids", say).  <br/><br/>I think this example is a little extreme, but the principle can definitely work - where everyone just hears "horrible demon form" and imagines what it looks like to themselves without ever communicating those details.  I could see a scene with no GM intervention where Susan and Joey argue about substance of their work and marriage without revealing what they picture as the surrounding reality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379033/#Comment_379033" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-20T17:01:10+00:00" title="May 20, 2012  5:01PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben Lehman ran this idea as a small, one-room LARP for nine players back in college; it was called simply "Nine."
