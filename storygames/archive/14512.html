Involved were SG regulars Tyler and Chris, Tracy, and some of my visiting gamer buddies from the 'Couv, Jerry, Jonny, and Demian.<br/>To start off, I should mention that I used a mildly adjusted version of HQRPG. I've been obsessing over HQRPG for a few weeks now, and was excited to get a copy of it to play with. To suit my gaming style, I changed up the professions and added a few more traits for the players, and for myself, I expanded upon the GM options for scenario creation and enemies. ...didn't actually need to, but I just can't seem to leave well enough alone. Still, fundamentally, there were no mechanical changes, just a little more color.<br/><br/>Anyway, because I'm totally not creative sometimes, I hacked the Death-Frost-Doom adventure with the first Silent Hill video game to make the one-shot: Village of Piebald.<br/>Tyler was Roderick, a faith healer<br/>Chris was Lethaniel, a reluctant lady of pleasure<br/>Tracy was Squirrel, a medieval WWE-style wrestler<br/>Jonny was Robert, a trinket merchant and brewer of strong spirits<br/>Demian was Ishmael, a rustic mystic from a very \u201cinsular\u201d town<br/>Jerry was Wolfgang, the local lord's own private chef<br/><br/>\u2026<br/>just tried to type more, but I'm quickly finding myself drifting off to sleep...<br/>anyway, I think this played easily and was the most gaming fun that I've had in a while. It suffered a bit from having only a few hours, but otherwise ran fairly smoothly. Did have to rush the last third of the adventure, cramming it into the last twenty minutes of the night.<br/>The group was also probably too large, and I gave too much attention to Jonny, Jerry, and Demian (as they are my old buddies). But I should say that Tyler had the MOST memorable faith healer, and Tracy was very amusing as an overconfident athlete. It was difficult to give Chris enough focus, because he's so much quieter than everyone else \u2013 but I do like the way he adds depth and backstory to even 30-second characters.<br/><br/>Hopefully Tyler and Chris will chime in (since my eyelids are drooping now), and I'll try and post more details later.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330562/#Comment_330562" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T02:18:16+00:00" title="June 18, 2011  2:18AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>It was difficult to give Chris enough focus, because he's so much quieter than everyone else</blockquote>\nYou're not the first person to notice this, ever.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  It was totally cool.  I think another issue was with the number of players we had in one game, but we did have guests so it was fine.  \n<blockquote> \u2013 but I do like the way he adds depth and backstory to even 30-second characters.</blockquote>\nAwww, shucks.  Most of that was on the fly -- and I ended up with the front of that 4x6" character sheet and some of the back filled with stuff I kept thinking of on the fly.  But the game made it easy; the hardest part was choosing the trade and traits!  Since they're all "roll or choose" I chose, and this was the first combination that hit me (Companion, Faeblood, Innocent).  I tried to come up with something else, but kept coming back to this -- obviously it was a sign.  Once I had it written down I tried to figure out why a Companion would be Innocent, and the Motive (get away from her handler) grew out of that.  Possessions came from that -- she didn't have time to pack; she saw an opportunity and ran!  She was dressed for her first night on the job.  <br/><br/>Anyway, yes, it was fun, and I really enjoyed developing her!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330643/#Comment_330643" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T16:04:41+00:00" title="June 18, 2011  4:04PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I rolled a thief who's traits we're cautious and faithful.

I mean, this was my first time working with HQRPG, but it essentially gives you everything one needs to run an adventure on the fly, keeping the mechanics so simple, you rarely need to reference anything.<br/><br/>So anyway, a basic summary of went on (now that I have had some time to sleep and caffeine is fresh in my veins). I'm going to keep it simple, though.<br/>The characters were all part of a small, angry mob of villagers, pursuing (for one angry reason or another), a swindler who made off with much of their village's material wealth. They find his broken down wagon within the region of a deserted town, and decide to investigate (though by "decide," I mean there wasn't much choice...but what the hell, right?).<br/>They first encounter old Jeb in his run-down farmhouse, who would rant and rave about thieves and such. As they find the nearby graveyard and the badly buried statues, they discover the terrible truth that the townspeople had all turned to stone years ago, and Jeb needed his map to remember how to safely navigate its streets (since his memory was full of crap...Jeb, by the way, was lovingly stolen from Death-Frost-Doom).<br/>Squirrel and Lethaniel head into town and discover where Fink the swindler had holed up, along with most of his loot, though he was missing and had left behind his clothes. The others were busy avoiding spending the night within the town (wise...very wise indeed).<br/>The next day, they discover Fink's body by the town well, half naked and the victim of clawing out his own throat. Turns out the ghosts of the villagers were restless, and sent him over the edge. After some more looking around the town, they all decide to explore the nearby Tower of Piebald, which was some old fortification from the olden days. There they discovered the body of one of Fink's accomplices, as well as dark secret of the tower - that it was the meeting place of the Cult of the Gorgon.<br/>After some further exploration, the trail of smoke coming from the woods behind town hall drew their attention, and while the wrestler and companion headed back to the comforting first house (where they found the resident ghost kept the place well-cleaned and prepared for friendly visitors), the others happened upon the home of the cult's head priest...who had fallen victim to the same curse as everyone else, along with his guard dog. That dog, though, wouldn't stay still, and would always turn to face the PCs when they weren't looking. Maybe too devoted?<br/>They also found a locket that held a clue to how to enter the catacombs beneath the Tower, which also contained some horrible, large black hornet that nearly killed Ishmael (who narrowly made his saving roll).<br/>After a quick trip back to their home village, where they were greeted as minor heroes for recovering their belongings, they decided to head back and investigate the Tower further. At this point in the game, Rainy Day was getting close to closing, so we started to rush through the final bits of the game. They all found the secret temple, and Squirrel foolishly opened the small box held in a petrified cultist's outstretched hand. Turns out it was the Eye of the Gorgon, and once again, the saving roll succeeded, and some quick thinking canceled its baleful curse.<br/><br/>If we had more time, I was hoping to really build up the suspense of entering the catacombs, and have a bit more searching time, as they wandered roughly-hewn passages lined with petrified zombies. Plus, at the end, there would have been some frantic combat. Instead, everyone sprinted out of there, partly because they thought the whole place was crumbling (I was going to tell them that it was just the sound of the petrified cultists falling apart, but then I just ran with it), and partly because some of them thought that, since Roderick was running first, that he had taken the other Eye of the Gorgon, and they wanted to stop him (I'm not sure why they assumed that there'd be TWO eyes...what if only one eye had been turned to an artifact? That potential conflict could've been FUN, but again, no time). Still, in the end, the whole town basically collapsed in on itself, and everyone lived happily ever after...except for the horrible curse they suffered from melting down the cult's large golden disc and living off the money from it.<br/><br/>Still, this was a lot of fun. I really want Ben to officially release HQRPG (hell, I'd pay money for it), and I'm thinking of e-mailing him the playset I put together (which had some inspirations from Apocalypse World).<br/>This is now my go-to game for quick fantasy adventures, just like DangerPatrol is my go-to game for quick, high-flying action adventures, and Cthulhu Dark is my go-to for quick horror adventures. I'm going to take it with me wherever I go where games might be played (and some places where they might not...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330789/#Comment_330789" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T23:09:54+00:00" title="June 19, 2011 11:09PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

Like instead of Local Lordling, I used the name Gentry, and such.<br/>I used the situation generator for rolling up some quick inspiration for several locations...that ended up never getting explored. The one that did get used was the home of the cultist. I was thinking, "Hmm, creepy, but needs something else." So ended up rolling for a Trap (the black hornet) and a significant bit o' treasure (which was the locket with the clue to the cultists' tower). All the other major locations I already had an idea of what I wanted, and I was all "Well, I wonder what's in here?" for the rest.<br/><br/>I'll make a point of e-mailing you the playset I ended up making, since I'm back at work where my hidden game files are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330875/#Comment_330875" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T16:13:42+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  4:13PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please do send it!

I may try and do a short sandbox campaign - have a starting scenario, and then just letting the players go where the winds will take them, making stuff up as I go.
