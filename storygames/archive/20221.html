The setting info tells of a highly-cinematic style world with high-flying action and absurdly dramatic and melodramatic happenings, yet the system is bogged down with systems and subsystems that all-but prevent the very setting it's supposed to support. <br/><br/>Another glaring example of this, for me, is Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space. I'm a huge fan of Doctor Who, and I'm really keen on most bits of the system, but some of it goes directly against being able to emulate Doctor Who stories. The 'yes, and' scale works wonderfully and the initiative mechanics is pure Doctor Who emulation in a few quick and inspired lines.<br/><br/>But there's a glaring problem with the system. You can't actually play a typical Doctor Who story with the rules as written. The trouble is the point-buy character creation and the stats for the Doctor. In any system that's supposed to emulate the tales of the Doctor and the Companion(s), you'd think that being able to have the Doctor and a Companion or three in the same group would be possible. Not only possible, but actually fun to play. But nope. Not here. Because of the point-buy character generation system the Doctor is stated out as a god who can do anything better than the Companions, even the things that a normal Companion might have spent a life-time studying.<br/><br/>Now, though that dynamic does fit the fiction of the Doctor Who setting, it's shit to have to play. Many other games have handled power disparity between characters well, DWAITAS simply does not. Some systems like say Marvel Heroic where you can play Thor and Beast on the same team and both are actively contributing to the group and are both fun to play. Instead of that DWAITAS makes the Doctor a 30th-level everything in a D&amp;D game where the rest of the party is 1st-level. Damn, that's maddening.<br/><br/>As a result, most players simply don't include the Doctor in their games or they design weaker Time Lord characters more on par with your average human, thus showing that the system breaks the cardinal rule of licensed games. If the game you've designed cannot emulate the property you're licensing, you've failed as a game designer. <br/><br/>So, my question is: other than using an entirely different system, what are some ways to handle this problem in the DWAITAS system? There seems to be a lack of suggestions in the books themselves, aside from a kind of reward for good RP on a session by session basis. One thing that might work is having the Doctor be an NPC that the players can spend story points to control for a round. But there'd either have to be a cooling off period, say you can only bring the Doctor in every few rounds, or something similar.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445820/#Comment_445820" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-28T05:20:05+00:00" title="June 28, 2015  5:20AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the sidebar on playing the Doctor seems to be most relevant here.

But that's a problem because by default everyone else who's not playing the Doctor is out of the spotlight, that's basically the definition of spotlight hogging. "There's one decent, effective character in the group, and you don't get to play him till... *checks calendar* six sessions in." The only way to resolve that would be to rotate who's playing the Doctor on a scene-by-scene or round-by-round basis, but that would get tiresome rather quickly.\n<blockquote>Another option might be to cut out the Doctor's ability to spend their own Story Points on their own skill checks. (They can give Story Points to others, and so on, which would push those other characters into the spotlight more.)</blockquote>\nCould work. But it might need a bit harsher limitation, like say the Doctor's able to earn story points, but can <i>only</i> give them to other players, whether a direct donation or via a gadget of some kind.\n<blockquote>I'm not going to say I've carefully run the numbers on everything in the system but it doesn't look like to me that being a "novice" Time Lord is actually that much of a huge advantage.

If you can't play the Doctor and/or a companion and it still be fun, what's the point of the game? Which is a bit weird, I know, as with other licensed games such as Star Wars I have absolutely no desire to play as the main characters from the movies. But other properties such as superhero games, if it's a Marvel game that can't handle a Marvel character (or a DC game that can't handle a DC character), I'm out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445825/#Comment_445825" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-28T18:25:49+00:00" title="June 28, 2015  6:25PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's not that the other characters can't do things, it's that they can't do things as well as the Doctor, so multiply entities.

The show is fiction and only bound by the dictates of drama, whereas the RPG is a game and therefore bound by the dictates of games. The game should emulate the fiction, of course, but the game should also be fun to play as a game. It mostly a matter of where the mechanics point gameplay. In DWAITAS the mechanics point toward task resolution within the confines of a set list of Attributes and Skills, and character creation is a point-buy system that rewards long-lived Time Lords. The game focuses on the gap between the characters, whereas the show does not. <br/><br/>Yes, the Doctor far outpaces the companions in things like knowledge of time travel, mechanics, physics, engineering, etc, but the companions are not typically useless lumps. The companions contribute and help and are often necessary to success in the show. But the mechanics of the game do not reflect this. In the game the companions are basically useless because the game's designed with traditional Attributes and Skills, instead of focusing on the cooperation and problem solving the show focuses on. <br/><br/>You get a companion (say Clara) with a +7 as her absolute pinnacle bonus to any roll, whereas the Doctor has a +5 as his lowest possible bonus, on up to a +15 in his best Att + Skill combo. And that +7 for the companion... it's in the exact same thing that the Doctor gets his +15. The next best the companion could do is Resolve + Athletics... which she has at +7, which the Doctor has at +9. But that's not how the show plays out. The companions are functional, helpful, and actively contribute to the Doctor's success. They also serve as something of a complication and foil. <br/><br/>Take Marvel comics as an example property. Wasp and Thor are on the same team and they both generally contribute to the success of the team in their own way. Now take most traditionally designed superhero games. One player wants Thor, another wants Wasp. You either neuter Thor to make Wasp viable or you make Wasp way more powerful than the fiction warrants to make the character viable in the same team as Thor. Now take MHR as an example RPG. Wasp and Thor are on the same team and they both generally contribute to the success of the team in their own way, though to be fair, MHR does this by focusing on emulating the ebb-and-flow of comic book fiction (more story game than traditional) and also by drastically flattening the power levels seen in the comics.<br/><br/>In Doctor Who, you have a super-genius time traveller and a normal human on the same team. In the fiction this works because it's fiction, in the game this doesn't work because there's a huge gap in usefulness between the characters. Running Doctor Who with something like MHR would work better as you'd get the Doctor with a few d12s here and there and the companion with a few d8s and maybe a d10. No problem. But they'd also focus on what the characters are good at, say Clara having a 'power set' about lying and manipulating people whereas the Doctor would have his jiggery-pokery and both would make meaningful mechanical contributions to the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445837/#Comment_445837" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-29T03:34:41+00:00" title="June 29, 2015  3:34AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our game of Doctor Who, I saw two solutions that worked really well:<br/><br/>The first was to split the party, just as JD suggests. This can be at a social event where everyone's meeting different people, or presenting plot lines that mean each character becomes interested in saving/helping a different NPC.<br/><br/>The other solution was way more subtle. The person playing our Doctor was deeply knowledgeable in Whovian facts and lore. But he was still just a regular person (rather than the Doctor). Putting him in the spotlight all the time as the person who had to make all the decisions and come up with all the plans put him under a lot of pressure. So, that created a great dynamic where is was totally acceptable (and felt in-genre) for our companions to propose solutions.<br/><br/>Our group had the Doctor, Martha and Captain Jack in it. I was playing Martha and can remember at one point saying, "I wish we had someone who was really resilient to life threatening injuries, so that we could kill them, and then pretend our fake Philosopher's Stone had brought them back to life." Our Doctor player went, "Hey, wait a minute ..." and grabbed hold of all the heavy-handed hints I'd laid out.<br/><br/>So, it felt very natural for all the players in our game to take on a leadership/driving-the-action role in our group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445838/#Comment_445838" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-29T06:04:17+00:00" title="June 29, 2015  6:04AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2015 6:05AM by JDCorley.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My "does the fiction have this problem" question might better have been put this way:<br/><br/>Assume that the game follows the fiction faithfully - do you feel the fiction has a single hypercompetent character and the others are not useful/don't get a chance to shine/whatever rubric you use to grade whether a character is worth being played by a player in an RPG adaptation?<br/><br/>The reason I ask is because as you note in your Star Wars example, there's plenty of good reason just to tear out the established-character section of the book and burn it if it's getting in your way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445847/#Comment_445847" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-29T18:24:34+00:00" title="June 29, 2015  6:24PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2015 6:51PM by liblarva.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My "does the fiction have this problem" question might better have been put this way:<br/><br/>Assume that the game follows the fiction faithfully</blockquote>\nThe trouble is the mechanics of the game don't really reflect what's focused on in the TV show. That's the heart of the issue. The mechanics speak to a completely different style of show than Doctor Who. The show does have a hyper-competent character with a few other assistants along for the ride... but that's not the focus of the show... yet that's the focus of the game's mechanics. <br/><br/>The show focuses on things that aren't mechanically represented in the game; the game mechanizes things that aren't strictly relevant in the show. Put another way yes, the Doctor is hyper-competent, but that's not the point of the show, but for some reason it's the centerpiece of the game. In other words, in the show it's not the gap in experience that's the centerpiece, rather it's that the <i>companion is still relevant and helpful despite that gap in experience</i>. But instead of that being the centerpiece of the game, overcoming that gap in experience is relegated to one of a dozen things covered by story points. The focus of the show is a minor piece of a catch-all subsystem in the game.<br/><br/>Think of it like the difference between D&amp;D and Dungeon World. You can end up with games that are virtually indistinguishable using either system, but the focus of each system is fundamentally different. To replicate the experience of a Dungeon World game with D&amp;D you have to ignore some mechanics and handwave a lot. That's the closest analogy I can think of right now to the disparity between the the Doctor Who show and the DWAITAS game. The show is Dungeon World, the game system is D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Emulating the Doctor Who show is the ultimate goal for any gaming experience that's supposed to be based on that property, but DWAITAS is like playing D&amp;D but really hoping for a Dungeon World game. You might be able to reach the same destination if you close one eye, squint with the other, and just ignore a heap of the game's actual mechanics... or you could just play a game that actually mechanizes the bits that are important on-screen and therefore better emulates what's in the show. It's like you only get to emulating the show by accident when playing DWAITAS. I'd rather a system that directly points you there in the way Dungeon World directly points you where it wants you to go.\n<blockquote>do you feel the fiction has a single hypercompetent character and the others are not useful/don't get a chance to shine/whatever rubric you use to grade whether a character is worth being played by a player in an RPG adaptation?</blockquote>\nThe fiction created by the show features a single hyper-competent character surrounded by characters who are utterly vital to accomplishing the tasks at hand. In the show, without the companions, not only would the Doctor fail most of the time, he'd likely not bother knocking about in the first place. The consequences of the show are that the Doctor travels with the companions because he's seen it all before, he sees the universe as new and wonderful through their eyes, because it's still new and wonderful to them. Without the companions he likely wouldn't bother traveling, what's more, he would not succeed <i>without</i> their presence.<br/><br/>The fiction created by the game mechanics features a single hyper-competent character surrounded by characters who are completely worthless and annoying to play. In the game, without the companions, not only would the Doctor still succeed, he'd likely have an easier time of it to boot. The consequences of the mechanics are that the Doctor is just keeping the companions around to make things more difficult for himself, to challenge himself with the presence of these lead weights, to see if he can still win <i>despite</i> their presence.<br/><br/>Wildly different.\n<blockquote>The reason I ask is because as you note in your Star Wars example, there's plenty of good reason just to tear out the established-character section of the book and burn it if it's getting in your way.</blockquote>\nIt is slightly different though, so let me explain a bit further. To me, the WEG d6 game captured the Star Wars universe quite well, mechanically. Things that were important were mechanized, things that were not important were not mechanized. The game works as a Star Wars emulator. But I have no interest in playing the canon characters. <br/><br/>It's basically the opposite with Doctor Who. To me, the DWAITAS game does not capture the Doctor Who universe well at all, mechanically. Things that were not important were mechanized, things that were important were not mechanized. The game does not work as a Doctor Who emulator.
