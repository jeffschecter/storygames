For example, Join Space can be used to create a gateway between two places.  Join Fire could be used to create the typical "flaming sword".  <br/><br/>Sunder is the reverse, separating two things that were attached.  Sunder Life "detaches" the soul from something -- and a subsequent Join Life can attach it to something else, thereby doing a "Magic Jar"-type spell, or a "switch bodies" spell.  Sunder Space can turn an area into a pocket dimension, with no way in or out without using "Join Space" to create one.  Sunder Magic "cuts off" an area magically, so that magic and magical things can't go in or out -- think pentagram.  Join Magic can be used to take magical energy and "attach" it to something, to create "power reservoirs" for magical wands and the like.  Alchemists could Sunder and Join the elements, removing, say, the Earth from something, then applying it elsewhere.<br/><br/>What uses can you see for them?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182077/#Comment_182077" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T08:42:20+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  8:42AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not a lot. I mean, when I played Zork and other games of that style (Infocom things), they had a simple parser that handled imperatives more complex than verb-noun, and it was still infuriating to tell the game what you wanted to do.<br/><br/>&gt; GET BOX<br/>I don't see box here.<br/>&gt; GET CRATE<br/>You get the crate.<br/>&gt; PUT CRATE INTO SLOT<br/>It won't fit.<br/>&gt; OPEN CRATE<br/>You take the lid off the crate. <br/>&gt; PUT CRATE INTO SLOT<br/>You slide the crate into the slot in the wall.<br/><br/>Any manipulation system needs more than verb-noun to provide any kind of unambiguous control. Just looking at your examples points out places that things can go wrong. Imagine if the Infocom parser were interpreting your verb-noun spells.<br/><br/>&gt; JOIN SPACE<br/>You join space. There is no air here.<br/><br/>The problem is that if you want to join two things, you probably want to specify which two things, so you need two objects. <br/><br/>&gt; JOIN THIS SPACE OVER HERE WITH THAT SPACE IN CLEVELAND<br/>You create a wormhole to Cleveland.<br/><br/>Certainly, you're not being literal about spells being verb-noun, but I assume you're talking about using it as a system for circumscribing the powers a magic system might offer. JOIN SPACE is the spell that connects two spaces. But once you've left the literal behind, it becomes just another spell system. "JOIN SPACE" doesn't mean "interpret JOIN as the verb and interpret SPACE as the direct object of the verb." It means "do some joining stuff and do some stuff with space, but I'm not sure how they relate, so wing that." Maybe that's enough for a spell system, but I doubt it. <br/><br/>Look at <i>Ars Magica</i> for a verb-noun magic system, by the way. In the end, it's not a literal system. <i>Creo Ignem</i> (create fire) lets you create fire in general, but the words themselves don't say where or how or when or how much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182091/#Comment_182091" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T09:13:06+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  9:13AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I certainly don't intend it to be used for a computer game -- and I've played Ars Magica.

He was the guy who raised the turkeys that get pardoned by the president every Thanksgiving.  He was also a guy who specialized in sympathetic magic, so he made a good amount of money on a sideline by creating a mystical connection between a wanted (or convicted) felon and said turkey.  when the president pardoned the turkey, the felon was also pardoned.  (<a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/video/in_thanksgiving_tradition_bush" rel="nofollow">The Onion seems to have stolen my idea</a>.)<br/><br/>This guy's sympathetic magic was extremely useful and fun to play.

They got used in ways I described above, and I found them invaluable for working out some kinds of spells.<br/><br/>I later came up with the idea of using "join" and "sunder" to imitate the Laws of Similarity, in a more "mechanical" way.  Basically, things had OtE-style traits, and you could join or sunder those traits.  Thus, a bird has the trait "flies", so you could Sunder that trait from it, then Join it to yourself, to give yourself the ability to fly.  I never actually ran a game using that, though, as that was around the time my group back then split up.<br/><br/>I also threw in "know" as a verb, but it didn't work out as well for me.<br/><br/>Riffing off of Adam's post above, and combining it a little with Jacson's, I remember an Internet-distributed magic system document someone made called "Mage2Mage".  It basically had a "magic programming language, with programs like:<br/><br/>Spell Fireball:<br/><br/>Create Fire with name "MyFlame"<br/>Move MyFlame to PointAt<br/>Resize MyFlame to 20' Sphere<br/>End<br/><br/>... which would be your basic D&amp;D-style Fireball spell.  The fun parts came in with two things.  First, loops:<br/><br/>Spell FlameStaff:<br/><br/>Create Fire with name "MyFlame"<br/>while True do<br/>  Move MyFlame to MyStaff<br/>loop<br/><br/>and second, interrupts, which let you interrupt an existing spell and change its "code".  Thus, instead of casting the fireball spell above, you could do:<br/><br/>Interrupt FlameStaff<br/>change "Move MyFlame to MyStaff" to "Move MyFlame to PointAt"<br/><br/>to cause the flame to leap to a target.  You could also do this to another mage's spells, and there were rules for "reading" someone else's spell, which determined how fast you could figure it out (so many lines per round, as I recall).  There was also an "On Interrupt" you could use to booby-trap your spells:<br/><br/>On Interrupt:<br/>If (caster != me) then<br/>  ... do something to make it blow up in the guy's face ...<br/>end<br/><br/>You could also use On Interrupt to give a spell a secondary capability.  For example, taking the FlameStaff above, you could add:<br/><br/>On Interrupt<br/>If (caster == me) then<br/>  Move MyFlame to PointAt<br/>else<br/>  Move MyFlame to caster<br/>end<br/><br/>So now, I can interrupt the spell without providing any further instruction to make it throw the flame where I point... but if someone else tries it, and isn't careful, it'll throw the flame onto them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182198/#Comment_182198" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T14:15:13+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  2:15PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back around 1995-6ish, some friends and I brewed up a somewhat complex magic system based around verb-noun, for the pretty-obscure Manhunter RPG.  It was pretty crunchy, taking a fair bit of calculation, but most of that was front loaded; once you cast the spell it was just a matter of adjudicating the effects.  We were all GURPS and Hero veterans so this wasn't an issue.  The basic idea behind it is that magic is some kind of extradimensional resource, and you can only handle so much of it at a time but that you can hold it and build it into larger effects; we had ways to equate points of mana to levels of damage and other things, and modifiers (basic multiples) to represent improving range, volume, and so forth.  We had a pretty small list of verbs (five sets of a word and its opposite, so you'd have Bind/Loose, Sense/Cloak, and a few others) but a pretty freeform set of nouns.  It used a skill difficulty system similar to GURPS, and wider applicability of a noun meant a higher difficulty to learn it; taking required "methodologies" (effectively limitations on your casting, such as requiring gestures or incantations) reduced the difficulty of the noun.  It was, IMO, unreasonably fun to play with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182270/#Comment_182270" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T21:30:49+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  9:30PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I honestly think that as long as you had the negation (which sunder is effectively anyway )its just a matter of time until you build up to more interesting nouns.

The idea is that they would try to construct sentences with those words, and, by figuring out the rules of the grammar, they would master the magical possibilities in that gameworld.<br/><br/>For example, most languages have a simple and repeatable rule for turning a statement into a question (often it's "switch the subject and the verb" or something like that). I can imagine magicians in the setting trying to change the order of the words in their incantations, and then try to figure out why they got the different effect that they did.<br/><br/>I've never actually put it together, but I would still love to someday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182709/#Comment_182709" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T16:30:49+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  4:30PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread brings to mind The Wiz Biz novels, by Rick Cook. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey're really quite good, in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182723/#Comment_182723" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T17:36:00+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  5:36PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>This thread brings to mind The Wiz Biz novels, by Rick Cook.<br/><br/>They're really quite good, in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way.</blockquote>\nYep, they're a favorite of mine as well... especially the first two.<br/><br/>Speaking of magical languages, in a long-ago D&amp;D campaign of mine, I decided that the "secret language" that mages wrote their spellbooks in was a logographic one, where each symbol was a complete word in itself.  (Like Chinese characters or Japanese Kanji.)  The mages had deliberately chosen to write magic that way, because with each symbol being a different word, one could not quickly learn to read a spell out of a spellbook.

These parts of speech are all symbols, and altering the adjective symbols adjusts the amount of "oomph" in your spell.<br/><br/>Each symbol has an element and a number.  Within a spell (magical sentence), the numbers interact with each other, and the elements interact with each other, and these interactions determine stuff like how easy it is to get the effect you're aiming for, and what side effects you risk.  This determination is further mediated by the positions of the sun, moon, and stars at the time of casting.<br/><br/>The idea was to blend "logic-puzzle toolkit" with "magicalness".  However, my one playtest showed that "magicalness" was really about the color given to playing through casting, and not at all about factoring in the moon or whether you had a sample of your target's hair.

They got used in ways I described above, and I found them invaluable for working out some kinds of spells.<br/><br/>I later came up with the idea of using "join" and "sunder" to imitate the Laws of Similarity, in a more "mechanical" way. Basically, things had OtE-style traits, and you could join or sunder those traits. Thus, a bird has the trait "flies", so you could Sunder that trait from it, then Join it to yourself, to give yourself the ability to fly. I never actually ran a game using that, though, as that was around the time my group back then split up.<br/><br/>I also threw in "know" as a verb, but it didn't work out as well for me.<br/><br/>Riffing off of Adam's post above, and combining it a little with Jacson's, I remember an Internet-distributed magic system document someone made called "Mage2Mage". It basically had a "magic programming language, with programs like:<br/><br/>Spell Fireball:<br/><br/>Create Fire with name "MyFlame"<br/>Move MyFlame to PointAt<br/>Resize MyFlame to 20' Sphere<br/>End<br/><br/>... which would be your basic D&amp;D-style Fireball spell. The fun parts came in with two things. First, loops:<br/><br/>Spell FlameStaff:<br/><br/>Create Fire with name "MyFlame"<br/>while True do<br/>Move MyFlame to MyStaff<br/>loop<br/><br/>and second, interrupts, which let you interrupt an existing spell and change its "code". Thus, instead of casting the fireball spell above, you could do:<br/><br/>Interrupt FlameStaff<br/>change "Move MyFlame to MyStaff" to "Move MyFlame to PointAt"<br/><br/>to cause the flame to leap to a target. You could also do this to another mage's spells, and there were rules for "reading" someone else's spell, which determined how fast you could figure it out (so many lines per round, as I recall). There was also an "On Interrupt" you could use to booby-trap your spells:<br/><br/>On Interrupt:<br/>If (caster != me) then<br/>... do something to make it blow up in the guy's face ...<br/>end<br/><br/>You could also use On Interrupt to give a spell a secondary capability. For example, taking the FlameStaff above, you could add:<br/><br/>On Interrupt<br/>If (caster == me) then<br/>Move MyFlame to PointAt<br/>else<br/>Move MyFlame to caster<br/>end<br/><br/>So now, I can interrupt the spell without providing any further instruction to make it throw the flame where I point... but if someone else tries it, and isn't careful, it'll throw the flame onto them.</blockquote>\nOkay, this may be the coolest, if most unworkable magic system I've ever seen. It's purely cerebral and would make for awesome magic duels. It rewards and also kicks people in the face for doing the same spells over and over. And to me, it feels like it duplicates the steps of magic if not the terminology. <br/>Damn.

For example, one must know that opening a small hole for one second causes fire to burst in all directions from the hole, and it will reach about 25 feet before ending. If you had said "a large hole," then you would have immolated yourself.  If you'd said "a small hole," then the fire would have spread about 5 feet in each direction.<br/><br/>Of course, these things cost energy. Pointing with a staff is cheaper than pointing with your finger. If it's a magical staff, all the better, and it's more accurate, too. Causing effects further away is more expensive. Larger holes are more expensive, and of course, opening them for longer durations is more expensive.<br/><br/>The "Do as I command!" is a sort of "go!" that tells the magical program to execute. Without it, you can't as easily set up effects that require concurrent effects, like this:<br/><br/>Spell Steambath: Right above my head, open a very small hole to the plane of fire for ten seconds. In exactly the same place, open a small hole to the plane of water for ten seconds. Do as I command!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
