                    The Whitmanifesto is simple:<br/><br/><i>Let us be large, let us contain multitudes.</i><br/><br/>Unfortunately, it offers more questions than answers.<br/><br/>How do we identify people who are marginalized or excluded from the role-playing community, and how can we show them what's amazing about what we do?<br/><br/>How can the role-playing community include these different voices, and make them feel at home, and as though they have worthwhile things to offer to what role-playing is?<br/><br/>How can we change what is perceived as 'normal' within role-playing culture so that these voices are no longer 'marginalized but included' but rather full members of the community, while still respecting the strengths of what we are and without alienating our own people?<br/><br/>And, here's the most important question - what are you, yes, <i>you</i>, going to do about it?  <br/><br/>This is not a question about what the story-games community should be doing, because I don't feel that I have any right to speak for this community.  (Nor do I think that this is an appropriate thing for us to do as a group!)  But I do think it's worth talking practically about what we, <b>as individuals</b>, might do to achieve the goal of making our hobby larger than what it is now.<br/><br/>Andy, if this isn't appropriate for the forums, I know you'll shut this down - but I hope that you'll find this discussion as fruitful as I think it will be.                </div>

                            That's a good question, and it's part of what I'm asking.  I don't want to limit this just to gender (though that's my own personal interest in this).  I think there are all kinds of folks that feel like roleplaying is just "not for them," and I'm wondering how we can be more inclusive.<br/><br/>For example: older roleplayers.<br/><br/>For example: roleplaying and religious communities.<br/><br/>For example: class issues in roleplaying.<br/><br/>I don't have answers, but I think it's worth discussing how we can make roleplaying something that includes more communities at its core, and what we can do on an individual level to make it happen.<br/><br/>For example: in the next month, I am going to introduce a woman who has never roleplayed before to gaming.  <br/><br/>For example: I am going to introduce myself to the next five people who register for these forums and try to make them feel at home.<br/><br/>For example: I am going to design a roleplaying game for retirees (though that's probably a longer-term project).<br/><br/>That's the kind of thing I'm talking about - so that we, as indiviudals, can see that there are practical things that we can do to make a difference, and maybe start to figure out what some of them are.                        </div>

                            I think a good start might be considering what the roleplaying community is or is not. Is it the web forums? The con circuit? People who play a particular company's games? Organisations like the RPGA or Camarilla? The local game clubs? Your group? The mere act of engaging in RP?<br/><br/> I guess what I'm getting at is that there's really a host of roleplaying communities. Which ones do you want people to feel less marginalised in? Identifying this will probably help...<br/><br/>Actually, taking a step even further back: What is roleplaying and why should people want to be part of its community? Is it games kinda like D&amp;D? Just story games? Or are you including wider ranges of activities like the simming and chat roleplay websites, parlour games, how to host a murder, interactive fanfic, world of warcraft and the hyper reality gaming folks? A lot of folks seem to get a RPG-like experience from other stuff that's off the RPG-radar.<br/><br/>Wow, this seems like answering a question with a barrage of other questions. Hope they're useful thinking fodder there, if nothing else.<br/><br/>-Matt                        </div>

                            Hi, a fair amount of my gaming "career" has been playing with non-gamers, people of color, etc.<br/><br/>1.  Good social contract<br/><br/>You will find that many groups will avoid weird power issues, emotional drama (between players) etc. if they sense or perceive it.  Good social contract is good for everyone, but frankly, it's often a barrier between many people at the gaming community at large. <br/><br/>2.  One follows the other<br/><br/>When you have a group that is (all guys, all white, all whatever), it makes it less comfortable for folks to break that mold by being the "first one in".  If you have a mixed group, people feel more comfortable about joining.  Linked into that, is that often you will find people "don't peg" the excluded communities as potential gamers.<br/><br/>Also, stuff like one shots work well because it puts people on even ground- like when you play any other game, you're not being asked to commit for a long period, or have an established a serious power hierarchy in any sense.<br/><br/>3.   Interests<br/><br/>Let's be honest- the D&amp;D/Diablo style dungeon crawl is only going to be of interest to a small subset of people.  As much as vampires, Star Trek, or Xena.  A lot of my friends were into HK movies, so I got them into gaming by way of Feng Shui.  This is part of the reason games like Primetime Adventures are pretty good for "gateway games" to get people into the hobby because they apply to fairly mainstream interests and are not difficult to learn.                        </div>

                            Ya'll want a definition of community? Here is mine: <br/><br/>The body of people with whom I play, or want to play, RPGs and with whom I regularly talk about RPGs and their makeup, design, and theory. <br/><br/>I do not know who may be playing something like an RPG out there somewhere. I do not know every person who may be playing D&amp;D whitebox still. I do not know how many Simulationists can dance on the head of a pin. I do not care. They are not my community.*<br/><br/>What I do know is that I want the group that I actually give a shit about to be able to host a multiplicity of experience. I want old black women playing at my table with young Asian men. I want to be able to talk with righteous feminists and Southern Baptists who can also talk to each other about how they see gender being used in RPGs. I want to know about Japanese RPGs and I want to know about American comic book RPGs. <br/><br/>Right at this moment I do not have as much of that in my community as I want. I rarely play, or speak about RPGs with, anyone above the age of 45. I rarely play, or speak about RPGs with, anyone under the age of 21. I have only ever played with black players a handfull times in 25 years of playing. I regularly play with women, but it is only recently that I've had a significant number of women to speak about RPGs and RPG theory and design with. <br/><br/>See, it isn't important to me to "grow the industry" or to figure out who abstractly may be playing RPGs somewhere. It is important to me that my own little corner of the hobby get better (bigger is only needed in so much as I don't want anyone already here to get pushed out), to get more diverse, and to have more voices, more games, more ideas, and more to share. <br/><br/>Who is excluded? Well that's a tricky one -- who are we excluding and who just doesn't want to join us? How much of it is us pushing people away, and how much people just not caring? Those are probably questions worth thinking about. But for now I know this very damn clearly: when I go to a gaming con, or look at the pictures of the folks on my LJ and blog lists about RPGs they do not look like the people I went to school with, the pictures of the folks on my non RPG lists and blogs, and most certainly not the average person I see on the street when I go outside. (I live in the center of downtown Toronto.) <br/><br/>I'd like to work at changing that. Not because it's the "right thing to do" -- but because I'm selfish, and I like having diversity and multiplicity to speak with. <br/><br/><br/>*These statements are a lie. I do care, they are "a community" -- but I'm not concerned with them at the current moment.                        </div>

                            To write a real response, I think this is more of a general issue than a roleplaying issue.<br/>
<br/>
I do not have any close friends who are older black women.  That's unfortunate.  Maybe if I had some close friends who were older black women, I'd try to see if they were interested in roleplaying.<br/>
<br/>
I played with a lot of non-gamers in college, especially when I ran an all-female (except me) semi-freeform game for a bunch of my female friends who enjoyed playing Once Upon a Time (the storytelling card game) and wanted to do something a little more involved, where the story kept going.  This would have definitely NOT WORKED if they hadn't already been my friends, if we didn't already have a good social contract.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, in order to play with a diverse group of people, first you have to KNOW a diverse group of people.  I'm still slowly working to tackle problem #1.  <br/>
<br/>
The internet helps, because it lets me meet "brown people" (as Shreyas calls himself &amp; Dev &amp; Neel) and female roleplayers (Annie Rush, Emily Care Boss, Meg Baker, Mo, Jess Pease, Liz Henry, Selene, and now Nancy and Jess II) and some Nordic folks (Eero, Markus, etc.) and people in other countries.  But most of the people I meet are Euro-American or European men.  And they're great people.  And I love playing with them.  But sometimes it's more fun if you mix things up a bit, adding in different perspectives.  It's an ongoing process.                        </div>

                            You kidding?  Canucks are even more ulcer-prone than Yanks.<br/>
<br/>
I like to think that one of the reasons Americans obsess over diversity and race issues is because we have more diversity than a lot of places.  Maybe that's just apologetics, though.<br/>
<br/>
I know, for one thing, I'm so glad race issues are actually talked about here, insead of it being like China.  There is no racism in China.  They just don't like black people there.  It's so pervasive that people don't recognize it.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  And we're "Rebs" in the South.  Not "Yanks."  :)                        </div>

                            In my experience, we [Canadians] aren't more ulcer-prone, just more aware of what we do.  We don't stress over it like "OMG am I excluding that person based on race?" but we do make sure we don't.  It's a very slight difference, but we're aware of it very differently.  Also, people are less likely to complain about something based on their race.  So someone is more likely to say "hmm.  I didn't get the job because I'm not as qualified." rather than "hmm.  I didn't get the job because I'm (race)."  Perhaps a better way to say it is that we go out of our way to be inclusive, rather than to make sure we're not excluding.<br/>
