Drive is a number between 1 and 10.<br/>If you get <i>more</i> successes on the reroll than your Drive, your Drive increases by 1 (in addition to spending them on things)<br/>If you get <i>no</i> successes on the reroll, your Drive lowers by 1.<br/><br/>The intended effect is that using your Drive makes good sense at lower levels, and it'll increase pretty quickly until it hits 5-6ish, and then diminishing returns kicks in and it's pretty difficult to get to the highest levels of Drive. Obviously, once you have a higher Drive than the die pool you are rolling, it's pretty hard to increase Drive (there are other ways, but not significant to this question).<br/><br/>However, this started to remind me of oWoD die pools, where larger pools rolled against higher numbers meant you succeeded less often. So I figured I'd see if any mathlete's could assure me that there isn't super statistical wierdness at the extremes (like, rerolling 10 dice with a Drive of 8, that kind of stuff)<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319055/#Comment_319055" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T08:47:59+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  8:47AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you use successes for totally matters in this sort of calculation. For instance, if you only really need one success, then using the Drive only makes sense success-wise if you rolled no successes initially. Or if you always want as many successes as possible and nothing else matters, then you should use the Drive when you roll less than half of your dice as successes and never otherwise.<br/><br/>If you're trying to increase your Drive and not so much simply succeed, that's a bit more complicated, but also instructive. Let's say your Drive is valued at D and your pool at P (assume P&gt;D), then your probability of worsening your Drive (not getting any successes) is 1/(2^P) and your probability of improving your Drive is the cumulative binomial function F(D, P, .5) = Sum[i = 1 to D](P over i)p^i*(1-p)^(P-i) (simple in concept, but hard to write neatly without math symbols). Now that we know how probably a given reroll will increase or decrease Drive we can calculate the expected value of the Drive after the reroll: let's say that the probability of the Drive worsening is P[-] and of the Drive improving P[+]; now the expected value of Drive after the reroll is of course D-P[-]+P[+], as both outcomes add or deduct one point from Drive. Therefore you should only reroll (insofar as improving your Drive goes) if and when 1/(2^P) &lt; F(D, P, .5). As it happens, the very worst case here is when D=P, in which case you need to get all successes to improve your Drive, the probability of which happens to be 1/(2^P). However, this is merely the same probability you have of fumbling - the probability of gaining all successes is the same as all failures for coins flips. Therefore we can conclude that you should <i>always</i> reroll insofar as improving your Drive goes as long as you have at least as many dice as Drive, or at least rerolling is never any worse than not rerolling.<br/><br/>I'll add that if the above conclusion (that it's always beneficial for Drive to reroll) bothers you, you might use the solution I used in a similar situation: in my game when you fumble, you lose half of your Drive score instead of merely losing one point. This compromises the expected development of the Drive value drastically and makes for more dynamic scores in general, as going up is slow but coming down is quick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319056/#Comment_319056" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T08:48:11+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  8:48AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2011 8:55AM by Harlequin.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Assuming dice don't explode... your initial roll and your re-roll have the same chances.\n<table>\n<tr><td>Dice</td><td>none</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3</td><td>12.50%</td><td>37.50%</td><td>37.50%</td><td>12.50%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4</td><td>6.25%</td><td>25.00%</td><td>37.50%</td><td>25.00%</td><td>6.25%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5</td><td>3.13%</td><td>15.63%</td><td>31.25%</td><td>31.25%</td><td>15.63%</td><td>3.13%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6</td><td>1.56%</td><td>9.38%</td><td>23.44%</td><td>31.25%</td><td>23.44%</td><td>9.38%</td><td>1.56%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7</td><td>0.78%</td><td>5.47%</td><td>16.41%</td><td>27.34%</td><td>27.34%</td><td>16.41%</td><td>5.47%</td><td>0.78%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8</td><td>0.39%</td><td>3.13%</td><td>10.94%</td><td>21.88%</td><td>27.34%</td><td>21.88%</td><td>10.94%</td><td>3.13%</td><td>0.39%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9</td><td>0.20%</td><td>1.76%</td><td>7.03%</td><td>16.41%</td><td>24.61%</td><td>24.61%</td><td>16.41%</td><td>7.03%</td><td>1.76%</td><td>0.20%</td><td>0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10</td><td>0.10%</td><td>0.98%</td><td>4.39%</td><td>11.72%</td><td>20.51%</td><td>24.61%</td><td>20.51%</td><td>11.72%</td><td>4.39%</td><td>0.98%</td><td>0.10%</td></tr>\n</table>\nSo even rolling 10 dice, you're only likely to get 4-6 Successes.

(That is, the "bell" part of the curve narrows as the number of dice increases, even though the endpoints get further apart).<br/><br/>You can never get fewer successes than zero.<br/><br/>You can never get more successes than the number of dice rolled.<br/><br/>Someone with Drive 2 rolling a pool of four dice is actually in the almost same situation as someone with Drive 6 rolling a pool of twelve dice. The only difference is that the latter is much less likely to get zero successes.<br/><br/>If the only outcomes that change your Drive score are "more successes than Drive" (giving +1) and "no successes at all" (giving -1), then you should re-roll any time the number of dice exceeds your current Drive, no matter what your Drive score is. For example, say your Drive is 10 and you are rolling 12 dice. Your chance to gain drive in this case is only 0.31%; however, the chance to loose Drive is <i>only 0.02%</i>. So, since you are over fifteen times more likely to gain Drive than loose it, you should re-roll. (This analysis assumes that "re-roll" means "roll again and take the best result". If it means something other than that, there may be other reasons not to re-roll.)<br/><br/>Hitting the "intended effect" that you mention, depends a lot on how you control the sizes of your pools.  This means you will hit your desired effect if, as Drive increases (linearly) at the rate of <i>x</i>, guarantee that pool sizes increase <i>no faster</i> than linearly at the rate of 2<i>x</i>.<br/><br/>Here is an <a href="http://anydice.com/program/6fb" rel="nofollow">AnyDice plot</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319229/#Comment_319229" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T18:10:14+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  6:10PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2011 6:22PM by Wordman.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, if you want a good rule of thumb for figuring out "will this reroll give me a Drive increase", that rule is "if the size of the pool is more than twice your current Drive, you will more likely than not increase your Drive".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319231/#Comment_319231" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T18:25:19+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  6:25PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2011 6:25PM by Esarel.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that is worth pointing out is that if player's pools increase in size over time the chances of drive decreasing is low.  What this means is that unless players choose to risk their drive on those 3 and 4 die rolls the drive is going to trend upwards over time.  Depends on number of rolls, etc but to get from 6 to 7 on 10 dice is more than 15%, while reserving drive for rolls of 5 or more dice gives me less than a 4% chance of losing drive.  There are similar numbers for any other die pool size.  If I'm rolling 6 I actually have a pretty reasonable shot at hitting drive 5 from drive 4 in ten rolls.<br/><br/>Is drive used for anything else?  If having a high drive is valuable to me for other reasons I might be less likely to risk it.<br/><br/>How often do you roll?  Will waiting around for that 15% chance pay off or will the game be over by the time I get ten rolls?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
