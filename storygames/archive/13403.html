Suna says:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>(re not liking Japanese settings)<br/>No rant, just to explain: I'm so sick of japanese settings. First, because they're most often presented in a wrong way, but most of all because people who play them know nothing of the japanese culture and mentality. Which is totally ok unless you've spent five years of your life studying it and their language, and three years working and living amongst them.<br/>I often thought: "why the japanese culture? Why not the indian, or mongolian, or an african one (any of them)?" I guess it's just because it's one of the most heard of (definitely wouldn't use the word "known") exotic settings in world pop culture...</blockquote>\nI've been thinking about blogging this for a while, but would like to hear other impressions.<br/><br/>I grew up on kung fu movies and asian blood cinema, and the long list of Japanese-themed RPGs (Bushido, Oriental Adventures etc) started coming our long before the rise of anime and even the ninja movie explosion of the mid-80s. So while in modern days we could say "the influence of Japan pop culture is the cause" for at least modern games, but historically clearly this was not the case.<br/><br/>So why so much on Japan, and not:<br/>China (while there's some, there's not nearly as much as Japan)<br/>India (...which area? Kingdom? Suite of legends/myths? etc)<br/>African (again, which area? old Mali, etc)<br/>etc<br/><br/>Is it that Japan was just asian/"exotic" enough to be different/magical, but culturally close enough to understand? <br/><br/>We'll likely have no "THE ANSWER", but I'd like to hear thoughts on this.

The production if similar fiction in entire Asia does not come close to being one tenth of the Japanese production (or so I read somewhere, I'm sorry, I can't find the source anymore, but in case I do, I'll post it for sure).<br><br/>I have graduated from the university of Venice with a degree in Japanese Language and History. The reason why I started studying, however, does not come from manga or anime, so maybe it's worth being explained. Personally, my infatuation came originally from japanese written fiction (novels by Mishima, Kawabata, Ibuse, Murakami), and the more I studied it, the more I fell in love with the classic literature of Japanese Heian and Edo periods. Of course I did read anime and manga. And back then, they had a way richer and more significant content than today's mass culture production. But it was not the main reason of my interest for the culture.<br/>Then I went there, I culture-shocked, then eventually grew used to it, saw all the negative, gritty things beyond the gilded surface that are ignored in the "mythical japan" image westerners have. And currently I can say that I positively loathe the japanese mentality and modern culture. But beware. It would be totally misleading to call "japanese mentality" what I have been experiencing since I used to live in Tokyo. And Tokyo is not Japan. Tokyo is a gargantuan city, where people live in a suffocating, overcrowded, sanity-threatening environment. It's an entirely different world from rural and smaller city's Japan. Still, I wouldn't like to live there again.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302072/#Comment_302072" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-24T07:31:44+00:00" title="November 24, 2010  7:31AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like it's cultivated by the gamer connection to Japanese fiction, specifically animation and manga.

The US had soldiers returning home who had not only fought in Japan, but subsequently been stationed there. It was these soldiers who prompted the interested in learning latter day Japanese martial arts -- karate and judo. And I'll bet it was these soldiers who brought home an apetite for other aspects of Japanese culture. <br/><br/>This wasn't true for China, India  or Africa. We didn't invade and conquer those countries in the same way we did with Japan. We didn't rebuild those countries into industrial superpowers the same way we did with Japan. <br/><br/>And the Japanese had a strong, living tradition of "cartooning" for lack of a better word. You can see brilliant panels depicting monsters, warriors and maidens stretching back through the 19th and 18th centuries, if not further. Where China translated it's operatic traditions to the screen in the form of kung fu cinema (to great effect), Japan translated its cartooning traditions (possibly to even greater effect). Both were brought back to the US after the war, but I'd guess that our close relations with Japan -- ease of import, namely -- allowed the Japanese pop culture to thrive.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Chinese culture was very popular in the US prewar. There were groups of moms doing local fundraising to help China from the Imperial Japanese all the way up through the end of the war. Once China imploded politically -- the Nationalists collapsed and the Communists took over -- the US began to distance itself from its one-time ally. And when anticommunism took hold as a religion for 30 years after the war, China fell completely out of cultural favor. <br/><br/>Just my amateur historian thoughts.<br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302077/#Comment_302077" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-24T07:40:12+00:00" title="November 24, 2010  7:40AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting points, Luke!<br/>And probably us Europeans have been exposed to Japanese culture as a reflection to the american cultural trend.

I can't recall a video game platform released after 1985 that wasn't Japanese or named after a Japanese term (<i>atari</i>). ColecoVision, maybe? And I'm thinking a lot of young kinds, during formative years, absorbed a smidgen of the Japanese cultural aesthetic: the root of later manga and anime blossoming.<br/><br/>Also: Very early "anime"/"rubber suit" shows like Ultraman, Speed Racer, Star Blazers, and... damn, that one with five colored space ships that could merge (not Voltron; the one from the late 70s).<br/><br/>So you got this new hobby called "RPGs" slamming into young minds around the same time that about half of the afternoon teens' shows are from Japan. Is it any wonder creative types in the industry started making Bushido, Oriental Adventures, and Robotech by the 80s?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302089/#Comment_302089" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-24T08:58:24+00:00" title="November 24, 2010  8:58AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is just a peripheral answer but Japan became a major modern economic power considerably before China, India or Africa.  It seems only natural to me that twenty-five years later you'd see Japanese influence predominate for RPG fodder.  In the mid-to-late 80s, prior to their "lost decade" people in the U.S. saw them as *the* economic rival.  Animation aside, you had all those cyberpunk literary sources that were that catalyst for any number of games during a golden age of role-playing.  Many of these saw the future through a Japanese lens.<br/><br/>We've seen more and more Chinese and Bollywood cinematic influence in the last decade as China and India come into their own as economic powers.

(And some the other way, from what little I know.) <br/><br/>That is to say, there are a lot of historical and cultural parallels between American and Japanese culture, but they're always set apart from each other in context and presentation. This grew as the nations got historically entangled (as Luke pointed out) to the point at which Japanese directors were making Westerns with Samurai and American directors were making Samurai movies with Cowboys until the Ronin and the Cowboy became a kind of grotesqued reflection of each other. Both countries were dealing with post-imperialist, post-war issues, both had some level of obsession with violence, a national mythology that praised a warrior spirit, a (for the rest of the world) sometimes bizzare mix of enlightened industrialism and religious conservativism... and both found the other's metaphors to be somehow fitting to talk about the cultural angst they were going through. <br/><br/>Now, in many cases this use of the other's metaphors became a use of the other as a metaphor, and down the slippery slope of fuckityness it went. The cowboy/ronin connection was taken over by geeky boys who didn't like cowboys (they'd been beaten up by cowboys in school), but loved the image of machismo and warrior poetry represented in the samurai, and thus found the different image to be a perfect in to the fantasy of masculinity they felt alienated from.  They couldn't be cowboys, but they could be samurai, and samurai were EVEN BETTER than cowboys. Similarly, many of the more aesthetic crowd found themselves alienated from the American move towards surrealism, but found shelter in Japanese design. Maybe especially when the "Japanese design" was able to escape close critique of quality by dint of being "exotic." Like, if you were to decorate your house in Eastern Contemporary Neo-Modern, you might have your lack of real taste exposed when your elitist prick friends come over. But if you do it up with a Japanese rock garden and talk about Zen, well no one can say shit because they don't know anything about Japan and if they do then they're racists. (Ditto poetry. You just suck a doing a sonnet, but haiku are exotic and spiritual and if people don't get them its because they just don't understand.) <br/><br/>Now that I've got some nasty out of my system, there are other situations like those that aren't all negative and icky. In many cases the shifts in emphasis, the new metaphors, the cultural depth of Japanese experience really touched people. Some folks just love the diversity of humanity, and something about that particular manifestation touched them in a legitimate way. This almost always happens in close cultural exchanges, and is often the birth of some very lovely things. (The Seven Samurai springs to mind.)<br/><br/>Edit: As for Why Japan for this and not others... well, that mirror thing is important. <br/><br/>I've often run South Asian themed games for players, and while some of the things hit their buttons well, others don't. It's easier for much of a North American audience to understand the dour self-destroying machismo of the samurai (especially the western influence samurai like Lone Wolf) than it is to get their warrior machismo on when playing a guy who wears a dress and lots of flowers. When compared to, say, India there are many things in Japan that read closer to American cultural tropes in our fantasy fiction. There is a more centralized, unified cultural standard, a similar approach to violence, a lot of aesthetic reflection, and so on. Folks like zen rock gardens and find Japanese buddhism easier to fathom than the flower-wearing, mudra-throwing, orgy-having gods of India.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302212/#Comment_302212" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-24T18:57:46+00:00" title="November 24, 2010  6:57PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>It's probably also a factor that the penetration of pop culture between Japan and "the West" has been more 2-way than with other similarly-situated Asian cultures - at the same time we were devouring their culture, they were devouring ours and reflecting it back at us in a familiar-yet-interestingly-alien form.

It reminds me of the history of the world in 100 objects BBC podcast and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/MAPlqOEHRsmI1awIHQzRSQ" rel="nofollow">episode</a> about Hokusai's famous artwork (The Great Wave) and its mass reproduction at the end of the XIXth century. It's an impressive show case of the cultural dialog between Japan and the Westerners. Hokusai was influenced by European art and eagerly adopted the Prussian blue. And later, in turn, Van Gogh and others were influenced by Hokusai. I'd bet that it's a phenomenon that's more widespread than just this example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302213/#Comment_302213" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-24T19:18:52+00:00" title="November 24, 2010  7:18PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>the flower-wearing, mudra-throwing, orgy-having gods of India.</blockquote>\nSome day....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302324/#Comment_302324" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-26T06:51:57+00:00" title="November 26, 2010  6:51AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Come on, don't be a tease Andy.

And yes I'm aware of plenty of exceptions - but this sort of naming can be done less literally, and certainly not as ham-handedly ("gaijinoshima").<br/><br/>I renamed practically every L5R location on the map so they wouldn't sound so nails-on-the-chalkboard to me...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302457/#Comment_302457" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T20:10:21+00:00" title="November 27, 2010  8:10PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a minute, I thought "Gaijinoshima" was the place where the advanced Asians came in their merchant ships to trade with the savage hairy long-noses... that would be cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302598/#Comment_302598" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T11:50:09+00:00" title="November 29, 2010 11:50AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2010 11:50AM by anansigirl.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite>Hokusai</blockquote>\nDitto on Hokusai.

Many cultures throughout the world at this time were overwhelmed by colonial forces and subdued into stereotypes and caricatures. Africa was given the blanket name of "the dark continent", any culture that wasn't a force to be reckoned with in a military manner was basically belittled. The mythologies and legends of those people were swept aside by Christian missionaries. China and Japan on the far side of the world were nations that the Europeans saw as legitimate powers, their cultures couldn't be so easily swept away. China went one way, Japan went another (India basically put up with the English but kept doing their own thing anyway). Japan being a major "threat" during the 20th century, from a military, finance and technological perspective...and China (and India) setting up to fulfill the same bugbear role in the 21st. But this isn't a history lesson.<br/><br/>A lot of the other comments on this thread have really raised key elements as to why the Japanese culture is used in this way.  <br/><br/>I could rant on this for a lot longer, but that's probably enough for the moment. Suffice to say, stealing from Japanese culture seems to be a part of the norm now, that horse has bolted. Those who want to be reactionary feel the need to stop people stealing from other cultures while they are still "pure". <br/><br/>[Personally, I love Japanese culture. To the point that my wife and I replicated a Shinto wedding ceremony for our marriage (or as close as possible while getting married outside Japan and conforming to local legal wedding requirements). We didn't consider that "cultural appropriation" (though it could easily be read that way)...we did it because we love the culture and it was our homage to it.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302642/#Comment_302642" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T15:09:51+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  3:09PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vulpinoid</cite>it probably stems back to the imperialism and modernisation of Japan in the 19th century.</blockquote>\nI've occasionally thought about this in terms of that "cultural mirroring" thing I talked about between America and Japan. America and Japan developed into modern industrial nations at about the same time, and were more or less at their zenith of military industrial strength when they ran headlong into each other. <br/><br/>I also wonder if it doesn't have something to do with the reason why the Japanese get some love other cultures don't. Many folks have an unconscious bias against colonized nations, especially those colonized at the end of the imperial era. (India suffers from this, both externally and sometimes internally.) Japan, on the other hand, was "unconquered" an so still all of those things that in the ugly world of cultural stereotypes the colonized don't get to be... masculine, intelligent, self-determined, worthy... whatever. Japan gets to stand for the exotic orient, but without the stereotypes of weakness, technological backwardness, and decadence that many other cultures get tagged with. <br/><br/>Which is why Samurai get to be like cowboys but cooler, while rajputs and hushenying etc all get short shrift.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302674/#Comment_302674" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T20:05:54+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  8:05PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2010 8:13PM by Andy.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite>Come on, don't be a tease Andy.

I could write volumes, but instead I'll just post "bits", mostly responses to other folks.<br/><br/>* There's definitely a lot to be said for the fact that even before the days of manga and anime, that there was definitely an influence of media: Samurai movies and the like were in play from the 50s onward and ended up coming to the US.<br/>* And to be said about culture-swapping between the two nations. <br/>(for an interesting ironical take on similarities between Japan and other countries after a military and culture war, see Brian Posehn's standup routine about being exciting for the future world of Iraqi movies, Iraqi anime, Iraqi schoolgirl fashion, etc)\n<blockquote>Then I went there, I culture-shocked, then eventually grew used to it, saw all the negative, gritty things beyond the gilded surface that are ignored in the "mythical japan" image westerners have. And currently I can say that I positively loathe the japanese mentality and modern culture.</blockquote>\nAhhh, yeah I was there as well, in terms of the cultural adaptation phases ( <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cultural_adaptation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cultural_adaptation</a> ). I've seen people who lived in Japan, as well as myself, go through every single one of the phases, like clockwork, all in accordance with the length of the planned stay. It was unnerving, actually.<br/><br/>/Digression/ Neither here nor there, but I was /insufferable/. And I had just read Iris Chang's "Rape of Nanking", which made my outbursts/reactions even more insufferable (it wasn't until a few years later I learned that the data was mostly unverified lies, while the narratives were true; by then she had killed herself tho, but luckily there are better accounts that detail atrocities without simply making shit up). / digression out.<br/><br/>But yeah, I think I've got a healthy view of the culture: I'm definitely in that Acceptance/Adaptation phase, with brief bouts into Honeymoon again when I remember the food, and Crisis when I remember things like pollution, the government, neighborhood/kinjo relationships, etc.\n<blockquote>Interestingly, Chinese culture was very popular in the US prewar...</blockquote>\nThis is really interesting to note.\n<blockquote>Animation aside, you had all those cyberpunk literary sources that were that catalyst for any number of games during a golden age of role-playing. Many of these saw the future through a Japanese lens.</blockquote>\nWhat is interesting is that with the 80s industrial/production/technological power in Japan that emerged, people forgot (David Brin reminds us in an essay in Otherness) that just 10 years earlier, the Opec nations where the Big Deal: Just like 10 years later people thought that we'd be dominated by Japanese industry and tech (popularized in Cyberpunk fiction, movies, etc), but in the 1970s people had the exact same expectations of the middle east: They thought that learning Arabic was the key to economic success, people were prepping for the big economic and cultural rise of the middle east... Japan overshadowed those thoughts in the 80s, and were jacked up as mentioned by cyberpunk movies and books, by "Japan, the Elusive Bad Guy" movies (Rising Sun, etc), etc. \n<blockquote>Japophilia was already a thing in Europe long before the world wars, when it was known as Japonism or Japonaiserie. Artists everywhere were influenced by ukiyo-e prints.</blockquote>\nAnother quick fun aside: The World Ukiyo-e Conventions are held in... the UK. There are literally more preserved traditional wood-block prints outside of Japan than inside. Before and after the war, Japanese manufacturers (like ceramics outfits) would use them to pad boxes of fragile material like plates and stuff. So some hotel in the UK would unpack a crate of purchased ceramics, to find that there was all this awesome art just kind of heaped up as padding. It started a boom overnight. Just an interesting ukiyo-e story.\n<blockquote>That is to say, there are a lot of historical and cultural parallels between American and Japanese culture, but they're always set apart from each other in context and presentation</blockquote>\nWhile the feudal Japan period doesn't really have an analogue in the US (more close to middle ages Europe), there are a ton of real parallels in culture between the westward expansion in the US and the Edo period in Japan, mostly the economic changes that made money the center of things, massive cultural changes, the lack of a backbone of propriety/'honor' as a guiding influence, etc. Westerns and "Traditional Samurai Stories/Movies" aren't really similar, but Westerns and Edo-era "dirt under the fingernails" Ronin/Samurai are surprisingly alike; just that the Japanese ones take place usually in or around the culturally head-spinning big cities (read: Edo), and westerns took place in outposts of culture in a wild land.<br/><br/>* Ewen alluded to it, but one of the reasons often thrown around similar threads (and I'm kinda shocked to see it not harped on in this one as others in the past here, or on RPGNet, etc; I've even see Japanese gamers on 2ch heckle westerners who want to play in Japan-themed settings) is the "fanboys of the ninja/samurai" element. It was built up by tons of movies, then later anime and the like.<br/><br/>But the thing to remember and be *very* clear about is that no matter how far we fall in an attempt to mystify, glorify or exaggerate the cultures of things like ninjas, katanas and samurai, we (westerners) can't even scratch the surface of how the Japanese themselves have done it even worse. From the emerging pulp-like fiction of the early/mid-1900s (see Ikenami Shotaro, and his works which single-handedly launched everything from Baian the Assassin, Hissatsu Shigotonin, Sanbiki ga Kiru, and Basilisk Nimpocho (movie version: "Shinobi: Heart Under Blade") and which heavily influenced works like Dagger of Kamui and Ninja Scroll), to just glorified tales handed down over and over; the Japanese are far better at over-glorifying the awesomeness of ninjas, samurai and katanas far more than spotty gamer kids could do.<br/><br/>* An example: I need to get the name of the book that my friend showed me, a Japanese account of the history of the katana in the modern days. Something like over 5,000 officer swords (katana) issued to officers, a *huge* number/ratio given the amount of officers and up, were returned to the quartermaster and HQ for replacements. In many cases there were truthful accounts that accompanied the katana return:<br/>** Interestingly enough, well-made katana won't shatter in normal circumstances on strikes unless there was some imperfection; in most cases they instead quickly begin to curve to the left or right, unable to be sheathed or wielded.<br/>** But most of the accounts of these returned (mostly bent, some broken) katana were things like:<br/>"I struck a giant boulder with the katana. I was surprised that the exquisite and devine katana did not simply slice completely through the boulder. Please send another."<br/>"During a drill, to emphasize the divine nature of our goal and our unfailing legacy to our troops in a demonstration, I tried to cut through a one-foot-wide/two-inch-thick iron water pipe, but the katana would not penetrate the metal..." <br/>etc<br/><br/>These examples are extremely pertinent, lest we assume that only white people glorify some aspect of Japanese culture. There are probably parallels with other cultures, the most unfortunate at the top of my head being the Boxer Rebellion (or as I like to think that it should properly be called "The Kung Fu Rebellion"): "Our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_shirt" rel="nofollow">iron shirt kung fu</a> can stop bullets!" ...sadly, no...<br/><br/>Even in the RPG world, one of the recent best-selling RPG hits in Japan, an almost "story game" of drama and action that sold so hot that the producers dropped three more supplements for the game (when they never intended any): A game about school-aged ninja that fight against each other in a kind of World-of-Darkness-like setting. With ninja magic.<br/><br/>...cont with my own thoughts...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302680/#Comment_302680" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T20:52:41+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  8:52PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, some quick answers of my own on the initial questions I asked:\n<blockquote>* (general) Why haven't people made games about other "exotic" cultures (Note: 'GURPS India' has been "In development" since at least 1996)<br/>* ...like China, India, etc?</blockquote>\nSo, with all the above comments in mind, as well as the contextual dialectic/back-and-forth of US and Japanese theater and media, I think one of the main reasons is "there hasn't been enough accessible media about other cultures".<br/><br/>Without at least pictures of life during those times through things like movies, or even better through dramas, period pieces, or excellent (usually kid-focused) books like "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Up-Ancient-China/dp/0816727163/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1291090670&amp;sr=1-3-spell" rel="nofollow">Growing Up In...</a>" or Usborne book series that shows pictures of places, people, people doing things in what was imagined how they went about their lives (and not just the regular stream of archeological "shit that was dug up" with dry professor-text in B&amp;W reference books), in vivid pictures and color, it's hard to even *interface* with that culture. Western cultures like Greece, Rome, Viking, Celtic have been done over and over, so those cultures are easier to interface with. I've seen similar references for things like Aztec, Egyptian and Chinese cultures as well. But not too many others (Cambodian/SE Asian, Indian for non-Indians/people not already immersed in Indian culture through their family, African other than Egyptian (and maybe old Mali), etc).<br/><br/>Without more visual books, comic books, movies, cartoons etc set in those cultures, it's hard to get them really planted in folks' minds I think.<br/><br/>China is coming out strong recently, though: In the post-Crouching Tiger world, the Hong Kong (and mainland China at times) movie machine has been in overdrive, delivering cool action cinema pieces that aren't just cool because of the fighting, but because of the attention paid to the scenery, the backdrops, to make it feel like you are there witnessing a snapshot of the period firsthand. A far step above the (admittedly awesome) "every old Chinese town was the same" backdrop of the Shaw Brothers classics, there are flicks like Red Cliff, Battle of the Warriors, Ip Man, Seven Swords, Xu Warriors, Hero etc that declare a period of Chinese history (ancient, modern, etc) and then do their damnedest to make you feel like you're there.<br/><br/>Which means? I'm in a far better place to get into and fired up for a Chinese-themed historical or fantastical (if based on an era, or something like Xu Warriors) game than I would have been say 10 years ago. As for Aztec, I've got some of the aforementioned pictureish books and "Apocalypto" (plus more dry texts of course). Not much, but actually a much better start than 10-15 years ago.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, I've seen far more Indian/Bollywood movies in the last ten years than Chinese movies. However, the only historic ones that could at all fuel an RPG-ish setting/game would be Asoka and Jodhaa Akbar (they're long, so that's thaaaaat much more fuel); I've seen the PBS/Peter Brook's Mahabharata and some of the classic BBC one, but it's far harder to get into if you haven't grown up being immersed in the culture (though I have run a 2-session game based on the Bhagavad Gita/battle of Kurukshetra; where a player (Arjuna) got the dealio from Krishna (me, GM) re "Dude, all the world is Maya; there's no killer and no one being killed. So saddle up, bitch!"). If more movies like those come out, I could see more movement towards an India game.<br/><br/>In the end, it's not all about a deep understanding of the culture and people beyond the simple heavier cultural overtones, a lot of this is "I know what castles look like. I know what an axe looks like. I know how people used to pray towards God before a battle. But I don't know what a "castle" in Mali, Patna, or Hunan looked like. Without Neel K outright explaining it, I wouldn't have known that the Bow was the Katana of India, or without reading some picture-books what sorts of weapons people used in ancient Thailand or Egypt. I don't know how the people in Angkor Wat or Catal Huyuk believed/prayed to their gods, etc. Without someone doing the research - hopefully accurately - and putting it in a book of pcitures, a movie, a visual media, it's hard to picture it.<br/><br/>Without other media, particularly visual media, that portrays how people actually lived, it's hard to get into even a fantasy version of it without weird results. Sort of like the visions the little girl has of Roy Walker's fantasy story in the movie "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO0LYcCoeJY" rel="nofollow">The Fall</a>" (a great flick, BTW).<br/><br/>More in a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302681/#Comment_302681" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T21:24:45+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  9:24PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2010 11:40AM by Andy.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, and the last, specific questions I had. Interestingly, no one went down the road of thinking about these, basically for folks who *have* played in Japan-themed settings, "what was the pull for you"?  I still think that's an interesting question, would like to see answers, but perhaps at this point it's best for another thread? ("For those of you who have played in non-Western settings, what was the pull for you?") Hmmm.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>* (specific) What's so fascinating about Japan as a fantastical/historic setting?<br/>* (specific) What's so fascinating about Japan as a modern setting?<br/>(for the specifics, feel free to share your own take)</blockquote>\nPersonally, I'm really not interested in Japanese monsters: I think most of them are pretty silly, pretty much on par with any ancient culture (see Russian/Celt), and trying to "monster them up" ends up completely transforming them into something else (Rasetsu/Rakshasa), or just doesn't capture the uniqueness. Maybe the Flame Princess game, where every monster is singular and unique, would be the best take I think.<br/>Oh, save Tengu. Tengu are pretty cool. You could swap them in for basically a flying version of Orks.<br/><br/>* As for fantasy, the fact that Japan was culturaly locked up with little outside contact for almost 1000 years produced some really interesting Galapagos-like quirks of dress, building, design, thought. In shorthand: Kimonos, honor, and tea.<br/>* Also, with its focus on swords in the feudal era up to the days of the Black Ships (the single most important cultural event in Japanese history for 200 years in either direction that would echo through every facet of culture and history; for America, it was "A Tuesday"), there's lots of room for awesome swordfights. And moreso than any other trait, a thing that almost all historical or fantastical RPGs focus on is Awesome Swordfights (or "Awesome Melee Battles").<br/>* Personally, I am really digging the Edo period as a setting, particularly based off of media like Baian the Assassin, Hissatsu Shigotonin, Zatoichi, far more than Kurosawa-like samurai battle epics of the feudal era. Again, the reason is that there's a real focus on personal stories rather than "stories of the clan/kingdom/family", it was an era where the merchant class and money basically up-ended and killed the caste system (it would just take a few more years for the caste system to realize it was dead), and filled with tales of bravery, misery, wrongdoing and justice. So much like Westerns, but with more of a "city feel" to it. I like cities, they're easier to relate to and introduce new areas and NPCs, so it works for me more than Westerns. <br/>* But sometimes the names are hard to get quite right. Edo era names (O-Mino; Ikegami Juugoro) vs modern era names (Ota Midori; Tanaka Kenji) vs ancient era names (Oborotsuki; Minamoto-no-Noriyori).<br/><br/>Modern Japan, and by that I squarely mean Tokyo or other big city (Osaka, Fukuoka, etc) is an awesome and ripe setting for me; in fact it's hard for me NOT to want to set a game in a modern Japanese city. This is basically the Shadowrun/World of Darkness effect of a big, busy city with tons of nooks and crannies, where a stylized mystical/violent version would be ripe for adventure. West Side Shinjuku at night (perhaps Shibuya as well) already looks like something straight out of a Cyberpunk or Shadowrun game. The Kabukicho could easily be the headquarters for your campaign's yakuza (as it is in real life) or a secretive clan of vampire-werewolf-ghost-mages. Asakusa or Nihonbashi already look like a haven for secretive ancient assassin-monks. <br/>This is, of course, harder to relay to people who haven't been to Japan. But at least if I- the GM here - have the images in my head and am on fire, and the players have seen enough to join along, then I can use description, sights smells and sounds, to get people into the zone.<br/><br/>Also, it must be said that Japanese media has also realized that Tokyo (in particular) is ripe for an RPG setting, as there's tons of games, manga, and books with a similar theme set in that huge city: School-age kids are involved with magical powers of some kind, fighting back the darkness infecting the city. This is the plot of almost every single magic-themed anime, manga or video game released in the last five years.<br/><br/>Ah, and why is it (almost) always high school kids? (for Japanese games, RPGs, media anyway): Everyone has had the same sorts of experiences in every school in every city or suburb in the nation: The school uniform and how it changes in fall/spring; the class trips to cities/Kyoto/Nikko/etc, attending a school club of some kind (physical or mental; most kids have spent countless hours in them), often doing juku/tutoring afterwards, and just the sheer amount of time spent in school or in school-themed activities. The "archetype of the Japanese school life experience" is something that is very common with most Japanese people, and far easier to make generalizations about than say "the school life experience of an American", which varies wildly person to person usually depending on which crowd/clique you found yourself with (mathletes, drama/choir, music, football, art club, yearbook, lowlifes, etc). Put a character in a high school uniform and you have something that at least part of every person in Japan can relate to at least a little.<br/><br/>Anyway, wow. I was supposed to be asleep an hour ago.

Without a type to start from, it can be hard for folks to get into it. <br/><br/>Some games can get past this with detailed settings and lots of art, but its hard, and uneven in application. (Though if folks can get into Tekumel, I shouldn't think the Mughals that difficult.) <br/><br/>In many ways I think that the "make it up with your group as you go" school of setting in Indie RGP land makes this even worse. If you are pulling stuff out of only what you collectively can recognize, you're going to be boned hard for getting outside the scope of what's most familiar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302810/#Comment_302810" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T09:45:11+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  9:45AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought about it more, and I think it comes down to <b>action movies</b>.  Japan is a major exporter of action movies (including most anime in that category).  Even though India has a huge film industry, it's not known for action movies, so we don't see Bollywood RPGs.  <br/><br/>Case in point: during the heyday of Hong Kong action flicks, when everybody in the West went ape for those HK action tropes, like gun-fu, two-gun action, double-time fight scenes, and wire-fu, there was an explosion of explicitly Chinese-themed RPGs and RPG supplements.  There was Hong Kong Action Theater, Feng Shui, all those White Wolf Asian vampire books, Wushu... maybe even Exalted fits into this.  Now the wave has crested.<br/><br/>This is a testable prediction, if in a few years Nigerian* flicks become a pop culture craze, we'll see a wave of games and supplements (Lagos by Night?).  <br/><br/>By the way, "appropriation" is not a code word for "the white kids are not allowed to play with the other kids' toys".  It's more complicated than that, and I hate to see people avoiding interesting themes in their design because APPROPRIATION!<br/><br/>*There is a Nollywood, but I've never seen any of their films.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
