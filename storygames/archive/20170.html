Up until last week I always wanted to teach her to role play but my wife thought rpg\u2019s were too violent. Even the made for kids ones that I\u2019d point out to her would be classed as such (so is most TV for that matter).  The game I had been working on was to be able to be violent if the players wanted it to be but not if the players didn\u2019t. For awhile I shelved the game, then last week happened.<br/><br/>I didn\u2019t mean it to happen. She was playing and saw me messing around with some dice. She likes to play with the gaming dice, which I don\u2019t blame her for, they are cool looking. Instead of handing them to her I sat down on the floor and we spoke about each one, how many sides they had, and if she thought there was a greater chance of rolling above a three on the smaller sided dice or the greater sided dice.<br/><br/>Then I asked her if she knew what a Story Game, or a role playing game, was. She had an answer because she lives with me and every once in awhile I mention it. I\u2019m a force retired gaming addict. I haven\u2019t gamed with anyone in three years, but I still read and write rules. She told me it was a game that you use dice to tell a story like her Story Dice that she plays with (my story dice that somehow became hers, she uses them to make up stories and has for a couple of years).  \u201cSure Kinda like that\u201d, I told her and explained to her about role playing characters.<br/><br/>Then I said that I was writing one for children her age to play.  Immediately she told me we should play it. It wasn\u2019t like a nervous lets play it, it was a, if we don\u2019t play your game you are being mean type of reaction. Her cute eyes could not be ignored.  I printed off all 10 pages of the game and we went to work.<br/><br/>If you want to read the rest of the Actual Play go here:  <a href="http://www.thingsikeep.com/story-play-test-one/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thingsikeep.com/story-play-test-one/</a> <br/>The complete text was too long for this format!  <br/><br/>If you want to know what the rules are in the game (which I kept vague in this actual play) you can find them here : <a href="http://www.thingsikeep.com/story/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thingsikeep.com/story/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/brandon%20p" title="brandon p"><img alt="brandon p" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/brandon%20p">brandon p</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445295/#Comment_445295" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-21T17:05:42+00:00" title="May 21, 2015  5:05PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.storyroleplay.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.storyroleplay.com/</a>  Updated the location of the rules and the actual play is now part of the journal there.

The first play test really helped with that.  I could ask "are you being active, friendly or smart about what you are doing" and she would immediately know which one.   The Qualities before that were close to those words but didn't apply to every situation.  For example Strong or Physical instead of Active...                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445301/#Comment_445301" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-21T20:29:01+00:00" title="May 21, 2015  8:29PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's a tricky one.
