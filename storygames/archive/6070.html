I hope they retool the content and redirect the focus - body counts and macabre spectacles don't really communicate the story of the Holocaust in a meaningful way.

I didn't find it merely symbolic. <br>\n<br>\nWould "The Shining" have been as interesting if the ghosts did not appear? I mean you could make it a work about how isolation can drive you crazy, without those elements. Are the ghosts real? Are they part of some "gestalt psychic landscape?" (if I might steal from the current CoC thread). To what extent are these things insanity? To what extent can we use these images in our minds effectively? If at all?<br>\n<br>\nI think it's great ground for investigation. All on it's own. <br>\n<br>\n(One day my son Alex tells me - age 4 at the time - that he doesn't control himself always, that sometimes there's another person, Tom, who makes him do what he does.

On some level all play is fantasy play, right?  Last night I played an utterly hardened zombie fighting park ranger who cares about nothing beyond himself and a little boy he's obsessively latched onto.  His callousness and tough guy posturing, his complete prickishness is certainly cathartic for me and probably is helping me process my daily stresses on some level.  <br/><br/>Playing <i>Steal Away Jordan </i>is fantasy play, but you can play it absolutely straight (supernatural dial at zero) and come away with an appreciation and knowledge of a time, place, and lifeway.  Turning that dial up adds nothing to that feature of play, does it?  <br/><br/>I'm just ruminating on this, because it's super important to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135658/#Comment_135658" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T08:23:12+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  8:23AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2008 8:28AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, sure, that's one angle to see it from, one possible benefit. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, I think that it's more purely explorative, however. I like playing these games often for the same reason I liked reading Assimov and Clarke, the sense of "What if?" It's important to me as an investigation into values, and the meaning of our existence. You've probably heard me liken RPGs to the activity performed by story-tellers in "living myth" societies. As ritual, I'm certain that it is cathartic, yes. But the social purpose is to communicate values, and investigate things like, "What would we do if we were slaves?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI really know next to nothing about Steal Away Jordan, so I can't comment cogently on it. But if there's a value to the fantasy elements, it's sorta "meta," no? Ever seen the movie "In The Mouth Of Madness?" I mean, not only can we potentially look at what fantasy means to the characters, but also what it means to us. In fact it's unavoidable, in that every character investigation reveals something about ourselves as players. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it's no surprise that fantasy worlds are so prevalent and compelling in RPG play. I'll go out on a limb and posit that it's not a random act of fate that resulted in the first RPG being based on a world like Tolkien's. That, in fact, RPGs are self-referential to some extent. To discuss people like ourselves through a fiction like an RPG, we have to discuss it through a world that is, explicitly, a fantasy.  No, not always, but it makes sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheck this out... actual Myths differ from RPG in a particular significant fashion. Myths are about "Heroes" meaning characters who do things on a grand scale that have particular meanings for us. Shreyas has always been obsessed with finding play that's like this. Instead he runs into games like Hero Quest. Which claim to be mythic. But the difference in HQ is that you don't actually play these Heroes. You play people who exist in a "living myth" society who believe in these heroes, and you emulate them. Almost all fantasy play is this way, as are most fantasy novels (I'd argue that Tolkien is a strange mix). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe "fantasy" is not that we're the heroes, but that we're living in a world where we believe in heroes, and the supernatural nature of their acts. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135662/#Comment_135662" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T08:47:55+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  8:47AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It's unfair to judge based on three screenshots and some hype, right?</blockquote>\nDunno.

Seeing the details though, I'm feeling the same way, that the blunt instrument of big text blocks makes it look like it's going to be Super Mario Bros. 15: EAT YOUR VITAMINS. What a shame. There are so many viable angles to come at this from, many of them without even mentioning the holocaust directly, and probably could avoid the censorship the developer is foreseeing, if came at from the right angle.<br/><br/>Jason, I work for an e-learning company and how to thread educational materials within a game and make it flow smoothly and naturally within that context is something we've been wrestling with. For another bad example, check out <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/ks2bitesize/games/questionaut/pop.shtml" rel="nofollow">Pretty and lame</a> made by the BBC and the Samorost people. It's gorgeous and looks like fun, but after some cursory mouse-hunting interactvities, we're confronted with some blandly formatted multiple choice questions. <i>And it's clear that the multiple choice questions are the whole reason for the course's existence.</i> Hooray! It's like putting whipped cream, sprinkles, hot fudge and a cherry on top of a mouldy brussel sprout. There's no integration of learning and gameplay going on there, but I bet they think they're being clever.<br/><br/>A lot of games teach something, even if it's not the point. Sim City wasn't primarily designed as an educational tool, but it taught me some broad concepts about how cities work, as a kid, knowledge that's been useful. Said knowledge wasn't even imparted via text blocks. That there are residential, commercial and industrial sectors was a new concept for me and you learned how they worked through experimentation. My hunch is that learning happens more often in the games where education is a byproduct of gameplay rather than the other way around.<br/><br/>The question of fantasy is a whole other kettle of fish. I'd say it's the sugar on the pill to make it go down easier for kids. This is sort of assuming that kids need games to be fun, engaging or at least not a total bummer. Then again, kids are assigned The Diary of Anne Frank as reading material in schools. A lot of kids find reading assigned literature onerous, but they do it and probably get something out of it if they pay the slightest bit of attention. Could a game be assigned the same way? Could you make a game about the stark realities of the Holocaust without some sort of false veneer laid on top work? Not yet, but maybe some day, I would guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135700/#Comment_135700" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T11:57:05+00:00" title="March 20, 2008 11:57AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2008 12:07PM by lachek.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Greg Costikyan's blog provides a very good example of what we DO NOT WANT here:<br/><br/><a href="http://playthisthing.com/iced-i-can-end-deportation" rel="nofollow">ICED</a><br/><br/>Examples more along the line of what I think you're talking about, Jason, are here:<br/><br/><a href="http://playthisthing.com/ayiti-cost-life" rel="nofollow">Cost of Life</a><br/><a href="http://playthisthing.com/mcdonalds-video-game" rel="nofollow">McDonald's Video Game</a><br/><a href="http://playthisthing.com/redistricting-game" rel="nofollow">Redistricting Game</a><br/><a href="http://playthisthing.com/peacemaker" rel="nofollow">Peacemaker</a><br/><br/>Don't tell me what's right and wrong.

It is simply this: In playing a game, you are complicit in creating the experience, and the experience is personal and immediate, because you help make it happen. Moreover, games are algorithmic systems, and can, by exposing users to their implications, get across far better than any other medium how systems function -- how history evolves, how businesses work, and perhaps something like how our system of immigration control produces inequities by its nature.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135708/#Comment_135708" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T12:27:20+00:00" title="March 20, 2008 12:27PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff, Mikael.

How do we translate the good examples to tabletop?</blockquote>\nWith an effective, streamlined system customized to the situation / issue you want to explore. But I don't need to tell you that, <i>Mr. Murub</i>.<br/><br/>Answering that question made me realize why systems that only simulate physics are so poor at providing that pedagogical effect. Even if the group is engaged in collaborative storytelling, it is transparent when an issue is addressed by individual narrative rather than system. When one of your peers raise a possible answer to a question, it is no more effective than if she had raised it while the two of you were engaged in a debate. If the system raises a possible answer, it will be considered less as <i>opinion</i> and more as <i>truth</i>.<br/><br/>Further, you can test the theory by attempting to reproduce the effect, or manipulate it in other ways, and achieve expanded insight into the subject. This is harder to do with a person presenting a narrative, as even if you ask "What If..." questions they will attempt to stick to their opinion. A system has no such defenses, and will gladly adjust to allow you to explore alternate solutions, which lends further credibility to the message the system implicitly relays to the player.<br/><br/>As a simple example, the competitive nature and thematic elements in "The Shab-Al-Hiri Roach" seems to drive players towards visiting atrocities upon each other even before the evil elder God starts asserting its influence. This teaches a lesson in human moral behaviour which has made at least one of my friends reluctant to play it with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135718/#Comment_135718" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T13:55:09+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  1:55PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (biting lip)<br/>\nwho's history Jason!<br/>\n(runs screaming mad into the woods, then runs back)<br/>\ni've never seen Oregon Trail in glorious C-O-L-O-R!<br/>\nwhere is imagination escaping to?<br/>\nheck, even imagination had it's hand in the Holocaust.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135719/#Comment_135719" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T14:04:18+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  2:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, you caught me, I'm fishing here.

Zip, zilch, nil, nada. D&amp;D has a great message in the system, which is "kill stuff, get stronger". Matt Wilson's Galactic has a message in the system, which is "your friends are your most valuable asset".<br/><br/>GURPS has nothing. That doesn't mean it's not a good framework for building a ruleset that does, but inherently, the system doesn't take a stance. In not doing so, it is not infinitely flexible from an issue-addressing standpoint, it is infinitely confusing and ultimately, more subject to the whims of the GM than to any particular issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135742/#Comment_135742" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T15:25:17+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  3:25PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2008 3:31PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>A lesson for the tabletop, maybe: Don't tell the player what your message is, or even decide on a singular message at the outset.

I've been able to do pretty well with just horomones, very little public manipulation, and no horrid additives. But those other tools are there. And without using them the board of directors are constantly harping about how slow growth is. But there's also a practical risk of having to deal with public health and environment and such.  To recreat something like this in a game, you simply develop a bunch of systems that reward the player in one way, and carry a certain risk - to be accurate or educational, you'd want the reward and risk to match the source in a general sense.  Adding horomones lets you move cows from the feed lot to restaurant faster, using less food. Benefits are you don't have to dedicate as much towards soy fields and you can keep your restaurant stocked. Downside is that it slightly increases the risk of obesity criticism from the public.<br/><br/>The ReDistricting Game presents it even more matter of factly, with small controlled scenarios. The first one is a really simple population balacing, then you have to worry about pleasing the majority party, then you have to please both parties, then you have to please both sides and introduce a ethnic representative.  Just from the first couple you see how the system is being manipulated. In the final scenario, you see the proposed reform measure and how it balances things out.  But the message is pretty clear the whole time that reform is what the game is pushing. And yet it does so by presenting the apparent facts in a straightforward manner.<br/><br/>In the first case, it's not necessarily something everyone will agree with. Maybe it's speaking to an audience (since I'm in that audience, it's hard to say how effective it is) but, well, a lot of indie games do that already, so speaking to an audience with a message they are going to be receptive to isn't a huge step.<br/><br/>In the latter case, it's much more populist, and the gameplay really just focuses on how the system works and lets the system be self evident, with only minimal manipulation, on how it is broken and needs reform. <br/><br/>But regardless of the method, I think the lesson is clear. Whether you're pushing a specific message or simply trying to expand knowledge of a subject, gameplay should contain the message, in a way that offers some flexibility to try multiple paths so you can choose to experiment with changing the system, or dive into it and push the elements even further.<br/><br/>Edit: I should add that the McVideoGame, unlike the districting game, doesn't really have any method for changing/improving the situation. Like you can't turn your McDonalds into a completely healthy place, or even a little thing like increasing wages - the only way to make employees happy is by firing them and replacing them (which is easy to do, as long as you don't fire too rapidly).  But because the other elements are really good, I didn't really notice it until just now.  So I think, harnessing the power of table top, it seems best to provide the flexibility of being able to experiment with changing the situation.  It brings to mind SimSocieties, at least in theory*, where you can experiment with different social models.<br/><br/>*The reviews pretty much panned it, so I'm not recommending it as an example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135766/#Comment_135766" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T19:58:54+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  7:58PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2008 8:00PM by lachek.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>Edit: I should add that the McVideoGame, unlike the districting game, doesn't really have any method for changing/improving the situation.

I assumed that not allowing the player to reach that state of harmonious bliss where everyone's happy was a very conscious choice. This has its own set of pros and cons. It is relatively easy to see through the illusion that this is a perfect simulation and read the message inherent in the design, which lessens the potential impact of that message. On the other hand, if the simulation was approaching perfection, the game would not make its point as readily, as players would see it as their goal to elevate their company to divine status rather than explore the hellish impact of running the company as the corporation the game is modeled after.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best alternative would be to aspire to a perfect simulation, but somehow rig the system to ensure the player would naturally attempt - at first - that wide path that leads to easy money and eventual disaster, rather than the narrow, virtuous path. Tricky balancing act, that.<br/><br/>Also, very good point about these games preaching to the choir. Who's going to play the McVideoGame? People who take their Hummer through the drive-thru a couple times a day? Hardly. People hovering around the poverty line, who apparently constitute a considerable part of McD's market? Unlikely. Wannabe-hippie middle class office workers who plays it on their "extended lunch break" at their cushy unionized job after chewing down their home-made granola and carefully saving the remainders for composting at home? Yep, more likely. And what impact does that actually have?<br/><br/>Yet, thinking about games like "Steal Away Jordan" (which I have yet to play, sadly) - sure, none of us actually think slavery's a good idea, but I can't help but think a game like that could still teach us (predominantly white males) a thing or two about the world. I guess it comes down to nuance. Make sure you have a message, make sure players receive it during play, but don't shove it in their faces.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135785/#Comment_135785" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T06:35:40+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  6:35AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SAJ is a good example.
