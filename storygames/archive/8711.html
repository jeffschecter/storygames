Players who don't find other players engaging enough to care about what they're up to are simply waiting around till its their turn, making other players nothing more than an inconvenience. And the only things left to engage with are the GM and the rules.<br/><br/>If that's the kind of play happening at the table, then you're better off with a video game.<br/><br/>For a while, I was creating games which were designed to make sure stakes were shared, or at the very least co-dependent, in order to encourage players to become involved with each other. But even when it worked perfectly, the resulting game wasn't fun unless the players wanted to engage with each other to begin with.<br/><br/>Luckily, I don't do that any more...much.<br/><br/>So anyway, I'm interested in what everyone else's take is on this, and if anyone thinks I'm overreacting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192717/#Comment_192717" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-16T04:29:01+00:00" title="February 16, 2009  4:29AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2009 4:39AM by Graham.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anon, I think it depends how you interpret the comment.<br/><br/>If it means "My players only care about the bits that involve them", it's toxic.<br/><br/>If it means "My players like to have some sort of stake in what's happening", it's not.<br/><br/>And then there's a weird middle ground, which might be good and might be bad, and, gosh, look, there's JDCorley in the middle of that middle ground, there's a surprise.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192719/#Comment_192719" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-16T04:38:28+00:00" title="February 16, 2009  4:38AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the players are all playing to themselves, then they're not worried about the audience either so it's not a problem.

Perhaps if I edited it a bit:<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;"><i>Players are <b>not engaged enough</b> audience members to <b>care about anything</b> that doesn't have something <b>directly at stake</b> for them.</i></span><br/><br/>It also has nothing to do with JDCorley's group or how accurately it may describe them. It's only here because I'm hard pressed to state it better.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>- the "prima dona" Player<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>- "the samurai, cowboy and monkey" party phenomenon</blockquote>\nThese are good examples of exactly the issue I'm talking about. However, the king of them has to be the 'Tell me when it's my turn' phenomenon. This is where players are so unengaged that they're not even paying attention to the game, let alone other players, unless it's their turn, at which point they often ask for a recap instead of having listened in the first place.<br/><br/>This level of engagement gets players thrown out of my games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>If the game is all joint/group stuff (a sweet D&amp;D dungeon crawl), then who the hell cares <b>what your character does on their own</b> or whether they have a mound of individual issues.</blockquote>\nCharacters going off on their own to do stuff is another good example, and it's an even bigger problem in games that have it as a staple (such as Shadowrun and its Deckers until very recently). Without audience appreciation, an individual's pursuits will not be given the kind of breathing room they need.<br/><br/>I've been in games where players started getting annoyed if you took longer than 30 seconds a turn (the 'what are you doing?' kind, not combat), and anything outside of system recognized actions was considered thoroughly a waste of everyone's time. In other words, the only thing they engaged with was the system.<br/><br/>Needless to say I had a miserable time playing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>If it's <b>90 percent group stuff</b> and 10 percent individual stuff, then you don't really have to be that involved in each other's individual stuff to still have a good time in the game.</blockquote>\nIf it's 90% group stuff, then it usually means the stakes are directly shared, so this issue doesn't become a problem. But again, individual stakes cannot be pursued unless the players are willing to give each other the breathing room necessary to do so, which they won't if they're all impatiently waiting for their turn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192900/#Comment_192900" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T08:09:18+00:00" title="February 17, 2009  8:09AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anon, regarding that last bit, there is something that occurs when stakes are "Shared" in real life.

There was a player who often complained that nobody cared about her character, who her character really was, and only cared about how much damage she brought to the table when combat came around.  So I built the scrip system that required character interaction along lines of strong characterization.  Went over like a lead balloon.  Turns out that while the player wanted everybody else to care about her character, she really wasn't too interested in caring about other players' characters, and was almost offended that the game required her to do so.  However, in playing the game with other folks, I find that the scrip system facilitates a sort of play close to television serials where characterization is constantly being reinforced by inter-character banter.<br/><br/>More recently, I designed <em>Agora</em>, which takes a slightly different approach.  In this game, you and your character have an agenda, and you work to forward that agenda.  You do not especially care about the agenda of other characters in the game <em>except where they intersect with yours</em>.  Finding those intersections is heavily incentivized, because when you can work together you are nigh-unstoppable.  And to add another layer onto this, everybody at the table is aware of this incentive and since everybody is playing rival characters and factions, it is in each player's best interest to prevent those alliances along agenda-intersections.  So you have players pointing out, often through gameplay and not table chatter, the differences between player agendas at the same time that players try to discover and hold on to their overlaps.<br/><br/>So here's the thing: in <em>FLFS</em> there is heavy, heavy awareness of where players plug into their characters and the rest of the game.  And this is fine for some modes of play and some preferences.  Sometimes, however, it's too much.  You can only have the happy shiney love-fest for so long before it gets old.  Or perhaps I can only have the love-fest for so long before I get tired of it.  In any case, it's not always the right tool for the job.  Sometimes, not caring about other players, except in the most cynical and self-serving fashion, is the order of the day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192943/#Comment_192943" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T12:16:32+00:00" title="February 17, 2009 12:16PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got to get me that FLFS, it sounds rad. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The full paragraph of mine from which the OP's sentence above was lifted emphasized that one big (and obvious) solution is to make something that was previously an individual's thing into a group thing.

"Why is my father acting this way, in my own perfect envisioning of my character's father issues, it should go this other way, everyone else kicking in is making things completely wrong and terrible!?" So it's not an all-purpose panacea. Sometimes I, I mean PEOPLE want to have something that is only theirs, and sometimes that happens in a group that says "oh I see, my input is not relevant here, good thing I brought a magazine".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192948/#Comment_192948" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T12:40:43+00:00" title="February 17, 2009 12:40PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the noting and passing around was so cool that after experiencing it at GC07 I bought the game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I then thought of taking it and combining it with Scene Presence from PtA and some other things to create an uber-hack of TV game, and then didn't <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>FLFS is great in this regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_193148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193148/#Comment_193148" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T15:31:56+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  3:31PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>When it's "Everyone's problem" it's also "Nobody's problem", because everyone waits for the others to get off their arse and do it, and in the end, no one does anything.<br/><br/>It doesn't happen exactly in RPGs, but look at KoDT (I know it's satirical, still), for the part about players expending<i>their</i>money/resources on something that others will benefit from as well.</blockquote>\nI've seen both of these crop up in games, and worse, in actual businesses. The latter can be mitigated by playing games people purchased through the 'ransom' model however <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Turns out that while the player wanted everybody else to care about her character, she really wasn't too interested in caring about other players' characters, and was almost offended that the game required her to do so.</blockquote>\nThis is sad, and all too common.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>However, in playing the game with other folks, I find that the scrip system facilitates a sort of play close to television serials where characterization is constantly being reinforced by inter-character banter.</blockquote>\nHmm, it certainly has been a while, but the scrip system always seemed a little too explicit and, as you say, heavy handed for me. It didn't 'flow' as naturally as I thought it should. I'll have to give it another look now however because in theory it shouldn't feel much different than FATE's Aspects.<br/><br/>I don't remember, but can you act against a scrip statement in a mechanically legitimate way like you can with TSoY Keys?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>In this game, you and your character have an agenda, and you work to forward that agenda.  You do not especially care about the agenda of other characters in the game <em>except where they intersect with yours</em>.  Finding those intersections is heavily incentivized, because when you can work together you are nigh-unstoppable.  And to add another layer onto this, everybody at the table is aware of this incentive and since everybody is playing rival characters and factions, it is in each player's best interest to prevent those alliances along agenda-intersections.  So you have players pointing out, often through gameplay and not table chatter, the differences between player agendas at the same time that players try to discover and hold on to their overlaps.</blockquote>\nNow that's my kinda game. More in-game discovery. Less 4th wall breakage. Balance between conflict and cooperation.<br/><br/>I'd love to see more games driven by this kind of 'objective entanglement'.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Sometimes, not caring about other players, except in the most cynical and self-serving fashion, is the order of the day.</blockquote>\nI can think of no other game which encourages players to take an interest in each other for 'cynical and self-serving' reasons more than Paranoia XP. The Peversity point system relies on players spotting how best to screw over the other characters, and in doing so they end up more engaged with each other than in almost any other RPG I've ever run. This kind of engagement also occurs in FATE, which is one of the reasons I like it so much.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter WHY the players take an interest in each other, only that they DO.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The full paragraph of mine from which the OP's sentence above was lifted emphasized that one big (and obvious) solution is to make something that was previously an individual's thing into a group thing.</blockquote>\nWell, I did kinda mention that in the OP. In hindsight I probably shouldn't have used your statement at all, as I think there might be some collateral meaning.<br/><br/>Another example: D&amp;D 4e tries very hard to make sure that a player is never 'reduced' to the role of an audience member. The stakes are almost always shared, and each player takes a part in achieving them. In fact, 4e is so largely group focused that it often undermines a character's individual color. It solves the problem by eliminating the source. As the old joke goes, if "It hurts when I do this", then "Don't do that".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Sometimes I, I mean PEOPLE want to have something that is only theirs, and sometimes that happens in a group that says "oh I see, my input is not relevant here, good thing I brought a magazine".</blockquote>\nWell this is fine too as long as it's not taken to extremes. Player engagement doesn't mean always being right up your... ehh...<br/><br/>Annnneway, I think this is more an issue of ownership than engagement, though they do overlap, as there's no way to productively engage with a player who wants to retain ownership over everything <i>about</i> their character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
