It is very traditional in most ways, however:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Does the game capture old school concepts without being bogged down by rules?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Does the heroism point mechanic work as described? (Does it work as Hit Points have always been described?)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Should directed (that is class specific) experience be added to each class?<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Anyone have ideas they'd be willing to share on keeping the "D&amp;D" experience as well as creating a more modest item economy?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Should starships be treated more as another character, or as a tool?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those wanting to see the cover art, take a look here: Cover Art                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
