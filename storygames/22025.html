If you want to tell someone you're playing something other than dungeons &amp; dragons (not that there's anything wrong with that game) people look at you surprised not having known there <i>are</i> other RPGs.<br/><br/>How do you deal with this issue? What do you say to get people interested? (Or simply explain the experience in some way)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482072/#Comment_482072" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-17T04:57:38+00:00" title="April 17, 2019  4:57AM">April 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who are you trying to explain this to?

For them I just go conceptual. Hey it's like organized make believe but we all agree on some rules to guide the story. <br/><br/>But usually it's Trad gamers and boardgames. <br/><br/>I personally usually just say "yeah there are other RPG's cool stuff on a spectrum of kind of like D&amp;D games on one end and some very very different sorts of games on the other"<br/><br/>That part is not so difficult, but I'm not sure where to send them to find out more info. Even the somewhat limited knowledge of the games I know it took quite a while to acquire.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482117/#Comment_482117" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-18T19:36:15+00:00" title="April 18, 2019  7:36PM">April 18</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There isn\u2019t necessarily a good \u201cjumping off point\u201d for story games or indie RPGs.<br/><br/>Your best bet might be Tabletop (there are good sessions of both Fiasco and Misspent Youth) and/or all the podcasts out there that do story game playthroughs.<br/><br/>Some Kickstarter intro videos could be helpful, too! They tend to be brief and to the point.<br/><br/>In the other hand, if you ARE asking about introducing and explaining:<br/><br/>For trad gamers:<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019m interested in role playing games that have a more dynamic narrative; they are designed to worry less about winning fights and more about characters, their stories, and difficult personal decisions. Some of these games don\u2019t even have a GM, so everyone gets to contribute creatively to what\u2019s happening.\u201d<br/><br/>For board gamers:<br/><br/>\u201cThe games I enjoy are tabletop games, like board games, but instead of manipulating figures on a board, there\u2019s a strong component of imagined or fictional material. As a player, you\u2019re not limited to the actions the game has specified for you, but can try a nearly infinite number of options to solve problems or get ahead. It\u2019s like participating in making a tv show, movie, or novel, while also being a character within it.\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482122/#Comment_482122" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-18T21:24:36+00:00" title="April 18, 2019  9:24PM">April 18</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always found that storygames are much easier to sell non-gamers on (in big part because they're very much designed to be parseable by non-gamers, whereas trad presumes gaming experience, and because storygames use skills more commonly held by non-gamers than tactics and strategy) as long as the DnD comparison isn't made, or as long as it's immediately shut down if it's made.<br/>"Is this like DnD?"<br/>"No, not at all."<br/>I can imagine it would be harder with neo-trad stuff and other more orthodox indie stuff though, since the answer with some of those games to "Is this like DnD?" is "ehh, sort of". whereas the stuff I play is entirely unlike DnD.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482126/#Comment_482126" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-19T00:34:12+00:00" title="April 19, 2019 12:34AM">April 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's been my experience, too.
