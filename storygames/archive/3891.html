Recognizing these things as conflicts, sort of blocking them off from 'just' roleplay, highlights them and creates a certain focus on what's happening then and there.  It becomes a <em>thing</em>, and often it becomes an awesome thing.<br/><br/>So my challenge to you, Story Gamers, is to share your awesome conflicts.  What made it awesome?  Why did you decide that it was a conflict and not just hand-wavey roleplay fodder?  What was at stake, and what did you (as a player or a character) do?  How did it resolve?  Did it impact later play?  And so on.<br/><br/>Here's me:<br/><br/>When we were playing <em>Roach</em> at Gamex 2006, Paul and Sarah were outside the Follies.  Paul's character was madly in love with Sarah's; Sarah's character despised Paul's but was happy to use him, so she had been sleeping with him to that end.  He was one of many, all of whom she used on a regular basis.  Paul's character was getting tired of being dicked around, and so he called for a conflict.  "The conflict is that we have a real relationship and you recognize it as such," he started out, to which Sarah just shrugged.  Then he added, "...which means we're <em>exclusive</em>."  And then it was <em>on</em>.  Both players pulled out all the stops, narrating in NPCs and tapping their enthusiasms, to win.  Paul won, catching Sarah's character in this relationship that cut her off from a good deal of power and pleasure, all for the sake of Pauls' character's ego.  The conflict serves as a tipping point for both the character's stories, and shaped a good deal of the game as a whole.<br/><br/>So what're your awesome conflicts, story gamers?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87363/#Comment_87363" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T15:39:53+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  3:39PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This past January at the EndGame Minicon, I was running a modded version of The Mountain Witch that had the characters playing death-row U.S. soldiers sent on a suicide mission to kill an SS General in his Bavarian castle in WW2.  A bit of Dirty Dozen/Where Eagles Dare if you will.<br/><br/>I was trying to pack the whole adventure into a 3-4 hour con slot.  And one of the players had actually walked out of the game earlier after his character will killed by one of the other players during the first encounter (they thought he was a spy).  So the atmosphere at the table was already pretty raw.<br/><br/>When the group got to the climatic scene where they entered the SS general's huge chamber with the stone walls and the roaring fireplace and saw an American general having cognac with him, no one knew what the hell was going on and everyone was forced to choose sides as the guns came out.<br/><br/>And then Brian flips over his Dark Fate card which basically said "I'm in league with the Witch (SS general)".  Karen was sitting next to him and her reaction was priceless.  She had been trying to keep the group together until this point.  But when she found out she had gotten double-crossed, she turned on Brian's character with a fucking *vengeance*!<br/><br/>There were a lot of dead bodies in that room when we finished.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87365/#Comment_87365" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T15:42:29+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  3:42PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm playing a PtA game which features two rival engineering families: one clockwork, the other electricity.  It's the season finale.  One of the players setups a duel between his family's clockwork battlemech and whatever the NPC electricity guy wants to bring.  The moment of the duel comes and I say, "So, the stakes are whether or not you win the duel?" and the player responds, "No, the stakes are the families' entire reputations."  I knew I was blowing my budget at that moment.<br/><br/>So we're playing Capes and it was my scene.  I decided to play my wife's Grease Monkey dad.  I had decided that he was concerned about his son and his robot child.  So, the first conflict of the scene was about the Grease Monkey trying to set his Gageteer son up on a date.  I lost that conflict but by that time my wife had brought both the Gageteer son and the Robot child into the scene.  She introduced the Robot Son's Free Exemplar Conflict: Exhibits Genuine Human Emotion.  I fought that one hard, as the Grease Monkey complained to the Gageteer that he was caught up in a fantasy about having a "real son."  I lost that one too,  I got the Story Tokens I wanted and my wife, resolving the conflict, just turns to me and has the robot child say, "I hate you."  I thought I was going to cry.

He decided to use her blood (since she's part of the mystic bloodline and he isn't) in a quick ritual to fix it. So Ted says, "I pull out my knife. If I win, the wine is fixed." So Roy, playing the girl's father, spends a point of Fan Mail to buy in and says, "If I win, she isn't mystically tied into this business." They both win, and Roy gets narration. So his character pops into the scene, grabs the knife, and gives his own blood for the ritual instead. We were all absolutely floored.<br/><br/>What made this awesome? First, it was just emotionally wrenching. Second, It wasn't the sort of thing we wouldn't have come up with in freeform play. The constraints placed by the system on the narration of the outcome forced Roy to come up with something that he wouldn't have narrated otherwise. <br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87381/#Comment_87381" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T16:13:14+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  4:13PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>So Chris, it was all in the set-up and then the reversal?

Brian picked the perfect time to show his hand, and I think Karen was looking at everyone except for him.<br/><br/>I really didn't set it up at all.  I didn't even need to sow seeds of doubt much because they were all fanning the flames for me.  So when the reversal happened, it switched from "let's kill the SS general and see about the American" to "You bastard!  I'm going to kill YOU!"  The reversal focused her character like a laser-beam and really upped the stakes for everyone else in the conflict.<br/><br/>So basically you had a lot of tension building up and occasionally being let out a little as the game went along.

The setting is a historical one where reputation matters.  It was also clearly very important to player in question (full disclosure the player in question IS Josh) and I wanted to make him sweat a little.  The outcome of the conflict totally affected the tone of the last few scenes of the game.  I remember the last shot being the three siblings holding hands among the wreckage of their destroyed battlemech.  It also impacted how I setup the starting situation of the second season.<br/><br/>The Capes game was a lot more unstable.  That particular moment stands out because it's where I finally figured out what makes Capes work but it was too little, too late for the game as a whole.  But I think what was so striking about that conflict was a reversal of expectation on my part.  The conflict was about the robot boy expressing genuine human emotion.  When I think of machines feeling emotion I think of a computer falling in love or laughing at a joke.  So when my wife won the conflict I totally expected some display of human warmth on the part of the robot child but then to be hit in the face with a *negative* emotion and for that to be tied to the phrase Exhibits Genuine *HUMAN* Emotion on the index card was kind of chilling.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87391/#Comment_87391" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T16:34:04+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  4:34PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2007 4:36PM by Josh Roby.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Which is great.

With regards to the latter, Roy found himself needing to narrate both how the ritual succeeded and how he kept his daughter from getting caught up in it. Because of those constraints, he realized that offering himself was an alternative that reinforced pretty much all of the themes we been hammering on.<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87406/#Comment_87406" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T17:18:57+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  5:18PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a nice one from a game of Ganakagok we played at Dreamation in January. <br/><br/>Fred's bitter prophet wanted to follow Frank's cursed youth into the latter's self-imposed exile, since the youth bore a talisman of the Stars that loomed large in the prophet's vision of what was to come. But the cursed youth had willingly taken on a huge debt of Bad Medicine from the village, and believed that his curse was to destroy his family. So he kept trying to outdistance the prophet, out on the ice, as he strove to return the Star talisman to the icy spire from whence it came.<br/><br/>Then came Fred's turn. A crack in the ice swallowed him up, and he was trapped beneath a clear sheet of ice, pounding desperately to try to break free, to no avail. Only the cursed youth could save him!<br/><br/>But Frank won the right to narrate. And so the cursed youth turned away. And the bitter prophet drowned beneath the ice.<br/><br/>Fred added a beautiful narrative fillip at the end, something like: "The bitter prophet sinks into the depths, and the human light fades from his eyes. Then something not human awakens in him, and his eyes become black as night. And he turns and swims away." (He would later return as a cannibal-ghoul to haunt the villagers left behind, while the cursed youth fulfilled his destiny by becoming the Sun and condemning the stars his family to oblivion).<br/><br/>This was clearly a conflict, because there were two different but equally compelling visions of how the story of those two characters should proceed, and only one could prevail. One did, via a hard-fought game-mechanical struggle, and that produced the plot point that then took effect. It was awesome because of how profoundly it reinforced Frank's vision of his character as a <i>cursed</i> youth driven on his self-imposed mission. It stands out for me as one of my favorite moments of game-play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87407/#Comment_87407" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T17:22:29+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  5:22PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to throw up another example that also used The Mountain Witch.  The first session we had a GM and four players.  After the first session, one of the players stopped showing up; perhaps the game wasn't to his liking.  But in any event, we now had three ronin rather than four.  Which meant that we could have 2-on-1 disagreements.  This is key.<br/><br/>Once we entered the Witch's castle during the second session, we walked through an outdoor corridor lined with human heads on pikes.  They taunted us and it was difficult to pass through without going a little crazy.<br/><br/>The next room was probably meant to be a simple encounter with one of the Witch's minions and a few helpers.  But when one of the ronin challenged the minion to a personal duel, I didn't feel like my character should get involved, so I sat it out and he was killed.  Then when the others came after me, the third character decided not to help *me*.  We all had Trust dice to give, but because of honor/pride/whatever we (as players) chose NOT to use them.  We could have "powergamer'd" our way through that encounter easily.<br/><br/>As a result we all died separately like dogs and the game ended with our severed heads on the same pikes.  Best character death I've ever experienced by far.  Because it felt personal and real.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87408/#Comment_87408" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T17:28:33+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  5:28PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>How come you want me to throw out conflicts that were "just roleplay"?

Chihiro's mother was possessive and overly protective (and maybe a demon), but also clearly loved her daughter. The initial betrayal of Chihiro sneaking away from home with her friends Yumi and Sachi was compounded when her mother caught up to them in the woods and restrained Yumi, physically squeezing the life out of her. The conflict came to a head when Chihiro stood up to her mother for the first time. As Chihiro's Best friend and Rival, Sachi and Yumi had to decide how the results of her actions would affect the relationship[ with her mother. Would she actually strike her mother to save her friend? Would she submit to her mothers will and let Yumi be (further) hurt or killed? Would standing against her mother with a show of defiance be enough to save her friend? <br/><br/>it was an awesome and emotional bit of conflict, but I can't actually remember how it ended!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87463/#Comment_87463" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T06:34:13+00:00" title="August 11, 2007  6:34AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great topic, plus we all get to brag.<br/><br/>So these two guys are on a boat anchored in the Big Muddy off Union-occupied New Orleans in 1863.  It's a carnival barge.  They keep circus freaks chained up in the hold.  One of these freaks happens to be the mother of one of the guys sneaking on board.  They are there, ostensibly, to rescue her (and the rest of the innocents) before sinking the boat.  They were sent because they are both masters of stealth and deception.  It's all creaking rigging and pipe smoke and slipping below decks past wary guards.  The guy looking for his mother has a lead on his compatriot, and he tracks down the evil guy in charge of the whole evil floating circus thing, who is secretly his father, and - as the resolution to a campaign-long plot thread - switches alleigances.  He burns two keys in one scene and joins the bad guys.  His fellow Civil War ninja arrives just in time to hear him spill the beans on all the good guys plans, and tell the Big Bad that there is another intruder on board, and casually agree to hunt him down and murder him.  And it is <i>on</i>.  Betrayer and Betrayed, both insanely sneaky skulky characters, enter into an extended conflict of stealth, with the stakes set firmly at <i>death.  </i>Pain is Brought Down, and these guys are Master and Grand Master respectively, and it is subtle and extended and very tense.  In the end, the Betrayer gets a knife in his ribs, grabs for a curtain as he falls, and reveals his mother, in a cage, who watches him die.  <br/><br/>This was awesome because both players had built to a point where the destruction of their characters was not only acceptable but inevitable (the Betrayed guy had Key of Doom by then).  So they were playing hard toward that end, fearlessly.  It was awesome because it very solidly resolved multiple story arcs in a satisfying way.  It was awesome because it was a pleasure to see two guys at the top of their game go at it in an unconventional conflict completely supported by the rules we were using.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87500/#Comment_87500" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T09:13:49+00:00" title="August 11, 2007  9:13AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Sorcerer: Dictionary of Mu</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe One True Khan of the Red Wastes (played by Eric) was trying to gather all the clans under his banner to make war on the decadent Lemurians.

Here's why that situation was a conflict, and an important one:<br><br>* First, because the rules of <i>Sorcerer</i> + Web Supplement (read: Ron) say so.  You've got a complex struggle of interests, so you bust out the dice.<br><br>* Second, it directly tied into Eric's kicker: the One True Khan's story is all about cementing his status as a leader of the Chosen People.  As a result of other actions in the game his status became very dubious.  Rather than some generic conflict, like, "Billy the Sorcerer gets into an argument about who gets the tip at dinner," this conflict directly tied into the character's narrative themes: the confluence of Tradition, Destiny, Ambition, and Honor.  <br><br>* Third, there was a lot at stake.  Eric had spent 2 sessions building his character up as a bad-ass guy who told <i>other</i> people where to get off, but now it was payback time and everyone he'd pushed around was now trying to reassert themselves, undoing the player's hard work.  The nearest equivalent would be if little Arthur pulled out the sword from the stone--and, after a day or two, Sir Ector and Kay began figuring out ways to manipulate him: he's not the king after all, not in any way that matters.<br><br/>* Fourth, it was massive.  Pretty much every NPC in Eric's story-arc got involved in this one.  His whole section of the SIS was buzzing.<br/><br/>* Fifth, Eric tried to batman the situation by marrying his demon instead of his mom.  This is a dangerous move in the best of times, let alone when everyone is gunning for you.  It was a huge gamble, which made the conflict fun to watch.  It was also a pretty thematic thing to do: here you've got this newly-crowned leader who thinks he's invincible, and we get to see what happens.<br/><br/>Hope that's helpful.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87556/#Comment_87556" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T15:40:06+00:00" title="August 11, 2007  3:40PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>octaNe</b><br/>The characters are in Lost Vegas, looking for a map that will lead them to the HQ of the Wasp Women who had kidnapped the older sister of the kid. He needs his sister to win a drag race so he can pay his rent.<br/><br/>There were at least 3 awesome conflicts in this game, for different reasons. The first two happened when the group hit the Strip. The Alien started playing machines and with his knowledge of hyperphysics won on the machines. However the group were trying not to draw attention to themselves so he stored his winnings in a hyperdimension. This doesn't sound all that good but he did have the skill of unknowingly doing the right thing. Right at the end of the game they confronted the evil landlord, and hey presto! the coins fell from the sky and covered the slimy money grabber. Perfect foreshadowing.<br/><br/>In another conflict the kung-fu monkey got up on the bar to get the word on the street from the barman. The player won the conflict. Instead of getting the info, she narrated her monkey having one too many tequilas and getting into a fight with his reflection in the back mirror, causing him to be thrown out. This was so awesome because players don't usually take narrative control to describe how they lose.<br/><br/>The third conflict was with the Evil Demon controlling the Wasp Women who had kidnapped the kid's sister. There was some kind of big battle going on between the Wasp Women and Alien Bounty Hunters when the High Plains Drifter ran into the throne room to confront the big red demon. He was drawing his pistols getting ready to blaze away when the go-go dancer pulled back a curtain to reveal a small man with a holoprojector and a microphone. Total reversal of the situation and a cool Oz ending to the game by a player making excellent use of winning narrative control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87560/#Comment_87560" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T18:10:09+00:00" title="August 11, 2007  6:10PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Bill: so Fred pretty much decided the only way his character was surviving was through the youth's help, which would pretty profoundly change the youth's plot arc.

I'm not so interested in the "Ron says so" part, and I wonder if the "complex struggle of interests" is a red herring -- as you say, a "complex struggle of interests" over who pays the tip at dinner isn't really a good conflict.  Things based out of kickers or other flags are always good, but in this case, in <em>Sorcerer</em> the situation is built out of the kickers, right?  So 'tied to kicker' is synonymous to 'tied to situation,' yes?  Ditto goes for the 'massive' scale, with a whole section of the SIS / situation buzzing -- and I take it things were buzzing because the stakes were so high, and the situation stood to be profoundly changed?<br/><br/>The batman part is really interesting to me, because it's almost like it's double-layering the impact to the situation.  The initial conflict is set up, and there's all this potential change in the air, and then the player decides that's not enough and layers in even more potential for change.  That sound accurate?<br/><br/>GBSteve, it sounds like the first one was cool because it set up an awesome reincorporation for later -- and the latter two fall pretty soundly into the 'utterly changed the situation'.

My developing thesis is more along the lines of, "Conflicts are knots of incompatible relationships among elements of the situation; game mechanics often referred to as 'conflict resolution' change elements and relationships of the situation; the eventual goal of a full reward cycle is to untangle the knots of conflict in the situation."  This thesis has me really excited for a lot of reasons, which I'm trying to formulate into something comprehensible outside my own skull.  But in specific response to your questions, I think I may have real answers: not guidelines, not rules of thumb, but like, actually, procedural answers that should create engaging play with 90%+ reliability.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The guy who won is still around, and still doomed.</blockquote>\nStill around as an NPC, Jason, or a PC?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87761/#Comment_87761" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-13T09:48:20+00:00" title="August 13, 2007  9:48AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Still around as an NPC, Jason, or a PC?</blockquote>\nPart of the reason that conflict was so awesome (heh) was that it was a pair of player characters fighting to the death.

We probably would have kept him around as an NPC villain though.<br/><br/>It remains to be seen what Isbo will do with his victorious-but-doomed character now...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87781/#Comment_87781" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-13T10:55:25+00:00" title="August 13, 2007 10:55AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Jesse: the sequence of rolls (absent explicit CR in<em>Sorcerer</em>) sounds like it did a number on the game situation.  Lots of things changed, and it changed how the game progressed from there.  Is that what was so compelling?</blockquote>\nYes.  In fact this is something I really like about Sorcerer that you don't get out of games with explicit Stake setting and all that.  Sorcerer's mechanics are HIGHLY random representing much more the tide or momentum of a conflict rather than the "odds of success."  So what ends up happening is you get a lot of unanticipated reversals and alterations to the immediate situation *mid-resolution* that require significant choices to be made right then and there.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
