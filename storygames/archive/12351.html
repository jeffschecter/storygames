Or you create a character that you quickly grow to love \u2013 someone whose story needs to be told, whatever that story may be. The game is going well, you\u2019re having a good time, and suddenly\u2026the game ends prematurely. Maybe it\u2019s a con game and you ran out of time or maybe a multi-session game fizzles due to perfectly legit but disappointing real life circumstances. Whatever the reason, you\u2019re left unsatisfied and wanting more. What do you do?<br/><br/>We all let ideas and characters go, but I\u2019m talking about the best ones, or the ones that really stick with you. Do you try to come up with new stuff for every game, do you import old ideas/characters into a new game, or do you find yourself combining bits of older material into something new?<br/><br/>-Rachel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277069/#Comment_277069" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T08:28:46+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  8:28AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a while, perhaps due to some combination of creative guilt or newbie enthusiasm, I tried to come up with really different stuff for each game. Sometimes that\u2019s easy if you play very different games. But sometimes I really want to explore things I\u2019ve already touched on. The tricky part here is to avoid trying to recreate the experience (that all but guarantees disappointment!) and try capturing the essence of what intrigued you instead. The danger, of course, is that you\u2019ll be left with \u201cblue balls\u201d again.<br/><br/>A while ago I GMed Burning Empires and really grew to love one of my Figures of Note. But due to scheduling complications, the game ended after 5 sessions. That was painful \u2013 there was a lot of good build up and we were right on the brink of all hell breaking loose. Some time later, the opportunity the play BE with a new group came up and I realized that the concept for the character I\u2019d made for the previous game would actually work quite well despite the very different world we\u2019d created. Maybe his story could finally be told. So I re-burned him and changed details that would make him a better fit but I kept his personality and key elements. I thought of it like a parallel universe. I loooooved having the chance to play him again. Things started really getting interesting and building up and he was on the brink of having to make the biggest decision of his life, and after session 5 (again!)\u2026the game fizzled. Oh the pain! I would almost do the same thing all over again just the give this guy a chance to have a story told. The \u201creuse/recycle\u201d part worked great, the game just had an untimely end. <br/><br/>A couple of years back at Gen Con, I played a game of Mist Robed Gate and my character was a chef and crime lord of Chinatown. She made good use of a butcher\u2019s knife and dried pasta. It was a satisfying one-shot and I enjoyed exploring some of those elements. The follow night I played Poison\u2019d and made a new character but using some of the same elements \u2013 an ambitious assistant cook with a butchers knife \u2013 and the game itself helped provide a very different experience.<br/><br/>How do you cope with games that end too soon and leave you wanting more? Do you ever reuse or recycle ideas/characters?<br/><br/>-Rachel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277075/#Comment_277075" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T09:20:02+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  9:20AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always reuse/recycle.
