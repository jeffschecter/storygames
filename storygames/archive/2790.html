In essence, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a role-playing, war gaming and board games \xe2\u20ac\u02dccompetition\xe2\u20ac\u2122 that takes place over a weekend. The idea of competitively judging people for their role-playing seemed a bit odd to me, but as I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d been asked by friends who were organising it to run games over the weekend, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d be in there and taking part anyway.<br/><br/>So, I end up running good old Call of Cthulhu. The slot you are given is six hours, so I came up with a game set in 1920 Constantinople: Turkish nationalists, British troops on the streets, hordes of \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s fleeing the Bolsheviks in Russia, all that sort of thing. The game wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t very heavily structured, as I really wanted to see how it would progress with more input from the players, rather than being the standard, procedural CoC investigate routine.<br/><br/>Rather than fully fleshed out characters with loads of background to them, I provided basic character details and a sheet with different boxes on it, contain phrases like \xe2\u20ac\u0153I know the dark secret of\xe2\u20ac\xa6\xe2\u20ac\x9d, \xe2\u20ac\u0153I have faith in\xe2\u20ac\xa6\xe2\u20ac\x9d, \xe2\u20ac\u0153This person will aid me for a price\xe2\u20ac\xa6\xe2\u20ac\x9d and \xe2\u20ac\u0153I love\xe2\u20ac\xa6\xe2\u20ac\x9d. There were 11 boxes in total. The players were told that if they filled any of these out, they would get a chip which would allow them to buy a success or add stuff to a scene that they felt was appropriate. It was a bit of a kit bashed way of doing things, but I genuinely wanted to involve the players in the story more whilst still keeping the game CoC.<br/><br/>On the Sunday, it worked brilliantly. Which brings me to the actual play bit I really want to talk about.<br/><br/>There was a point in the game when the players all wanted to do some research an investigation. But, instead of the usual \xe2\u20ac\u0153off to the library\xe2\u20ac\x9d routine, they all came up with their own scenes that they wanted to play out. They spontaneously chucked in chips and said \xe2\u20ac\u0153Can I spend this to have my own scene?\xe2\u20ac\x9d. One wanted to meet their opium dealer, the other and underworld contact and so on. The great thing was that they all developed these NPCs themselves and explicitly stated what they wanted from them. <br/><br/>The suggestion that they could play NPCs in each others scenes was also grasped wholeheartedly and made for a real feeling of participation. All in all, it went really well. The game really did rock quite a lot.<br/><br/>Which was great, because I had been terribly worried about running a very traditional CoC game with absolute GM authority, given that I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really take part in games like that any more (perhaps I should!) and would be totally and utterly out of practice. But the players really threw themselves into it and made the stories of their characters and the overall story really vibrant. <br/><br/>One of the best moments came at the end when one of the players came up to me, shook my hand and said it was one of the best games he\xe2\u20ac\u2122d ever played in. That meant a lot, coming from a stranger who had turned up not knowing who he was going to be gaming with and potentially expecting a very traditional CoC game. Great stuff.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63734/#Comment_63734" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T16:25:19+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  4:25PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm,<br/><br/>This is good to hear.

I explained that, yes, we would be using CoC mechanics. However, they would have opportunities to automatically do stuff if they used a chip. Like, if they wanted not to fail a sanity roll. Or, they could use a chip to add something they wanted to a scene, like a minor NPC or some detail that they felt was important. Both groups asked questions about this, establishing the limits of what they could do (and finding that the limits were fairly broad).<br/><br/>The first group, while they used the chips to a certain extent, were fair less 'in' to this method of playing the game. The second group, as previously mentioned, really got in to it and really used the chips to make the game their own. That's not to say that the first group didn't undertsand what the chips were for and how to use them, I guess they were just happier playing CoC as they expected it to be, which is cool as that's what they came to play. But as I said, the second group really grabbed what they could do and totally ran with it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Very cool, Malcolm.

As this was my first time involved in such an event, I went into it wondering exactlty what criteria there were to judge a 'winner'. However, there were no actual concrete criteria in place. So at the beginning of eachgame, I took a few minutes to let people know what I would be looking for. Solving the mystery and deafeating the bad guys wasn't important. What a player brought to the table in terms of creating character, creating story and enabling others to bring stuff in would be my main criteria for judging who did the 'best'. <br/><br/>There were three games of CoC running, and each group would play in two of them, one on the Saturday and one on the Sunday. So Group 1 would play in games A &amp; B, Group 2 would play in games B &amp; C and Group 3 would play in games C &amp; A. At the end, the GMs for each game would have a bit of a chat and discuss who did what in the game. And it was tough. The eventual 'winner' took part in my Sunday game. Not only did she really do things with the character she was given, she brought loads of stuff into the story and created opportunities for others to have the spotlight, often disadvantaging her character to do so. Which was great to see. In fact, all particpants in the game were excellent and it was a very tough call working out who to place.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64270/#Comment_64270" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T08:54:29+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  8:54AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MalcolmCraig</cite>Which was great, because I had been terribly worried about running a very traditional CoC game with absolute GM authority, given that I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really take part in games like that any more (perhaps I should!) and would be totally and utterly out of practice. </blockquote>\nYou shouldn't, you should do what you really enjoy, and then others will enjoy it too most likely.

I'm not sure why that needed mechanical support, am I missing a link there?<br/><br/>Hi Max, thanks for your comments.<br/><br/>I totally see your point about how, in a regular CoC game, this kind of situation would come up. In this game, though, I think it was more promonent because the players had, from the very start, permission to invent most of the juicy detail about their character.And not only did they get to do that, they also had the ability to create the NPCs they were going to visit. To my mind, the chips were just a representation of me giving them permission to bring stuff into the game that they found cool and enjoyed. So when one went off and said "I want this!", it prompted them all to create their own cool scene and NPC combination. So...<br/><br/>The player of the Turkish Muslim interpreter went "I must have connections in the underworld [scribbled something into an appropriate box on his character detail sheet], I'd like to visit my contact Faisal, the head of a noted crime family in Galata."<br/><br/>The players of the rich Azeri Jew went "I'm already an opium addict, I'm going to visit my dealer who is a wise old oriental man. There's a good chance he will have information on what we need, because he seems to be the type..."<br/><br/>None of this was prompted by me and came out of the blue. <br/><br/>I'm not sure this entirely answeres your question. Would this have happened had I run the game totally 'straight'? I'm unsure. I think that the explicit permission given by using the chips and stating how they worked certainly gave the players added impetus to add to the story in ways which pleased them and added to the game as a whole. Which, in the context of a one off game with people who had never met before, was a good level of investment to get from everyone round the table.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64358/#Comment_64358" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T06:13:46+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  6:13AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Malcolm, that did answer it I think.<br/><br/>In my games I'm playing with my Monday night group, we know what's cool in our group and what isn't and when it is appropriate to directly create content and when not.  <br/><br/>In a con that's not knowledge one typically has, you put in a mechanism which visibly empowered the players to add to the fiction so shortcircuiting the need for spending ages playing together as my Monday night group has to learn what's ok and what isn't.  Otherwise, in a con game, as you say people have never met before and so might well stick more rigidly to formal demarcations of player/GM roles.<br/><br/>Also, you made it apparent in the system that this was cool and encouraged, seeing the chips in front of me would be a visual prompt to me reminding me I had this option, having a finite number of chips helps me not to overdo it.  Even if I might do it otherwise (and in a con I probably wouldn't for fear of it being unwelcome to the GM) you're expressly inviting me to do it, which makes it more likely I shall.<br/><br/>So I think you did answer my question, and I think this sounds very cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
