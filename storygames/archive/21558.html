They all started with just a physical appearance and a line or two of what others first impressions were of them upon seeing them in the drill hall. We went around the table picking in rounds until each player had 6 characters. We then played them and started adding background details from a pool of traits (this included what they were really like behind their demeanour, skills, dark secrets, relationships with other cadets/judges etc). These were introduced in as the focus of the session so we got to know them as the story unfolded. However, the game also had a Big Brother type aspect where characters died off (training accidents, an APC crash, surviving the radioactive zombie hoard in the wilderness outside MegaCityOne), and we eventually parsed down to one character each. <br/><br/>Thinking on it I think I coukd turn that idea into the basis for a system to play out stories in the vein of The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones TV shows, where there is an ensemble cast that grow in character but that have shock deaths taking place each episode. You could keep the dead characters for flashback scenes... <br/><br/>*puts on designer hat and coat and heads out the door muttering something about being back soon*</p></div></blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> asked how we got the list of traits; they had been created by the GM and were laid out on the table. It included stuff like "Had a secret affair with x other cadet", "Was trained in firearms, +x ballistic skills", "Had a spare frag grenade kept back all along", and "Is an undiscovered psyonic user". That kinda thing. Besides this it was a fairly trad RPG set-up that owed much to the GW Judge Dread RPG and Paranoia. <br/><br/>I'm thinking of writing up the bits I'd still like to adapt. It would be a GM-less PvP Game set-up. I'm thinking of having a<br/>a system where there are several decks of cards and players have Story Tokens. <br/><br/>The first deck is of characters, with a name, physical description, and first impressions. Not sure how, but these either get dealt out randomly or picked in rounds until the players all have multiple characters. Characters will have an aspect like HotB present them with an Advantage which any player can spend a token to use, a Weakness  that other players can spend to exoloit, and a Behaviour that you gain a token for following or which other players can offer a token to be followed. <br/><br/>The second deck woukd be full of story hooks like the pool of traits above. Relationships, dark secrets, background info, skills, plot twists, etc. These could have a number dealt up each "episode" which players can bid for with tokens. They may give characters new Aspects or have some other story effect. <br/><br/>I'd also set it so that you have to spend a token for each of your characters at the start of each episode otherwise they have to die in that ep. My thinking is that characters are an engine for gaining tokens, through their weaknesses and behaviours, but also a drain on a finite resource. <br/><br/>Finally there is a deck of events that have to be overcome that episode that give reward and failure conditions based on how they are solved. <br/><br/>How to frame scenes and include characters is still rolling about my head, but I'll think on it more. I also want there to be either a winning character or the game wins... I suppose this will be bested on token balance and the effect if the events deck. <br/><br/>Any thoughts/advice so far? <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471335/#Comment_471335" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-01T14:57:55+00:00" title="April  1, 2018  2:57PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, played about with the token thing and it is broken AF but I reckon there's something in it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471337/#Comment_471337" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-01T18:56:35+00:00" title="April  1, 2018  6:56PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2018 8:20PM by DeReel.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope this is not a Kiss of death thing to say but I love the idea.I really want to see the ensemble cast skimming mechanism. I picture it in a Berlin XVIII setting, where the setting is so precise some cards are almost already written, but My hero academy is like a generic bull's eye.<br/><br/>For the collaborative PvE side, I have no idea how it would work, so I'll leave it alone, but for the rest, I would like to contribute. I think even with bad ideas a project goes forward, if only because they make you consider what a good idea would be like.<br/><br/>What is the problem with the tokens ?  Do you need to borrow some from the bank but not have infinite resources ? In which case, I have a tool for that. Do you have a one way flow, like one player "death spiralling" ? If the bid mechanism is what derails the economy, you don't need it. Just make a draft mechanism, and - some - handicap bidding, like in Smallworld (gameboard). It should be OK. You could do with the cards alone what you are doing with the tokens. From the Twilight struggle card-based wargame : each card has an effect and a value. An effect applies when you play the card. A value is used like tokens. Play the card for one or the other. This implies a value greater than 1 for saving a character. Maybe a less powerful and more emotionally bonded character is "cheaper" to save at the end of the episode. Your aesthetic choice. So, as you see, the token don't working with a first draft means there must be solutions. The hard part is deciding which ones.<br/><br/>How is that useful that Advantages and Weaknesses are not Behaviours ? Do you want to avoid players exploiting Behaviours ? I have a solution to this. Is it just out of tradition ? Tradition is great, but it never goes without alteration (unless it's sick or dying).<br/><br/>By plot twists, do you mean cards for (unexpected) events ? In which case you don't need more than the cards. Is it a vague tarot guidelines for "wheel of fortune" ? Why not. I just want to emphasize that a plot twist isn't something "in and by itself". It is the ripe fruit of narrative / strategic conditions where a plot twist is the thing to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471354/#Comment_471354" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-02T15:01:37+00:00" title="April  2, 2018  3:01PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aww, cheers for the vote of confidence. I'm gonna go forward with this but want to pin down the maths and post something more complete here first, tho your ideas have given me a lot to go on with. On thing tho: \n<blockquote>How is that useful that Advantages and Weaknesses are not Behaviours ? Do you want to avoid players exploiting Behaviours ?</blockquote>\nI actually want players to exploit behaviours to the max! The idea is that Advantages will give you a story edge at a particular moment but will cost you resources. Weaknesses are a way of other players paying you a resource tax in order to gain the upper hand against you. Behaviours are a way to gain resources by playing the characters to type, and a way for other players to pay you in order to make your characters act according to type at times where it may not advantage you besides.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471355/#Comment_471355" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-02T15:07:18+00:00" title="April  2, 2018  3:07PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your ideas are very interesting to me but I'm not sure if you want to achieve enseble rpg for itself or it's just a tool for a specific game experience.

What is see is that the playstyle we envision looks similar on the surface (ensemble cast) but at they core are very different things.<br/><br/>In my troupe play campaign most of the players played in a more relaxed, more hazardous, more experimental way than usual. It's because they have never really gotten into any specific character. When a PC died the loss was more just an emotional issue (they mourned a beloved naive half giant when he had died) than a real narrative problem.<br/><br/>I think you want the opposite effect, right? How do you want to achieve it? With the idea of spending a token for every PC to survive the next session?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471373/#Comment_471373" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-02T21:33:01+00:00" title="April  2, 2018  9:33PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, on a purely mechanical level, you need characters to generate your pool of tokens.
