The fourth helping completes the first episode of two that we played at GenCon 2008 together.<br/><br/>The players are Paul Tevis, Daniel Perez, myself and Mick Bradley.  The Producer is none other than Judd Karlman.  I'm very proud of this episode.  It was great fun to play and I've enjoyed listening to it, too.<br/><br/>If you're interested in PTA, you really should give this a listen.  We hit all the highlights of the game system and have a great time doing it.<br/><br/>If you're a Star Wars junkie, you should check it out, too.  We throw out tons of references to the original trilogy and have a romp of a time paying homage to the flicks.<br/><br/>If you want to hear a very talented GM using Story Game techniques, you <i>really </i>should check this out.  Judd consistently framed strong scenes and pushed to conflict without forcing it.  Its a beautiful thing.<br/><br/><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/canonpunctureactualplay" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://feeds.feedburner.com/canonpunctureactualplay</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177504/#Comment_177504" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T01:23:04+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  1:23AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rich! <br/>Le me say that I love this year's recording: last year I could not manage to finish hearing it because of the loud noise, but this time the sound is very good. Also, the introductory recap is really, *really* good both to remember what's going on AND to highlight the high points from the previous parts.<br/><br/>...and keep in mind that I'm really not a SW fan: I often don't get the most geeky references, but I still enjoy the show.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177625/#Comment_177625" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T15:21:59+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  3:21PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We decided to play in our room at the Embassy Suites precisely so that we would have a more quiet environment, both for the game and for the recording. I think it was the right choice, not only because the recording is very clear, but also because we were (or at least I was) able to get a bit more into character without the energizing-yet-intrusive circus of the Embassy Suites' Lobby after-hours gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
