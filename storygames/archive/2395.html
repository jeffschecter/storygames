                    At risk of wearing out the therm "Awesome-o-fy"...<br/><br/>Since I'm writing an alternate history game, I've been doing a lot of brainstorming on alternate and secret history storylines. Lately I've been playing with a technique for awesoming up historical figures to use as game seeds. Here's how it works: take a real historical figure. Take some real facts about them and twist them so they become over the top adventure fodder. Here are a few I've come up with:<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes" rel="nofollow">Thomas Hobbes</a> is nearing completion of his magnum opus, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Leviathan_gr.jpg" rel="nofollow">the Leviathan</a>, a giant steam-powere war machine powered by royal blood.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare" rel="nofollow">Shakespeare</a> and his sorcerous collaborator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon" rel="nofollow">Francis Bacon</a> summon otherworldy spirits using ancient Greek theatrical magic. In return for having their stories told on the stage, the spirits carry out secret missions for the crown, helping establish colonies in the New World, sinking Spanish galleons, and rooting out French agents in the British Isles.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Bosch" rel="nofollow">Hieronymus Bosch</a>, a half-mad painter with second sight creates terrifying portraits that reveal the secret faults and sins of his subjects. His most recent work, a huge tryptich landscape of the City of Brussels entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Hieronymus_Bosch_-_The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights_-_Hell.jpg" rel="nofollow">The Garden of Earthly Delights</a> shows the locations of doorways to Other dimensions and additional Secrets Man Was Not Meant To Know.<br/><br/>Now it's your turn.                </div>

                            Check out Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver saga for a great literary example of this, although in a less magical style.<br/><br/>Ditto with Orson Scott Card's Alvin Maker series - although that one has magic in spades.                        </div>

                            Sounds vaguely familiar!  I find that if you do enough research, you'll find stories that are compelling enough on their own.  The thing that they often lack, or rather, the thing that they require that not every member of the audience will understand, is the context of their actions.  Thomas Paine wrote <em>Common Sense</em>, and everybody knows that.  He also was a bit of a tinkerer, working on early steam engines, and made a harrowing transatlantic journey to get to America because that's where the action was.  Unfortunately, "working on early steam engines" and "harrowing transatlantic journey" don't really sound or feel as weighty as they were if you don't understand the level and rate of technological advancement or what sea voyages were like.  So what I'm doing is taking the structure of history's stories and just punching up the specifics a little -- so Thomas Paine builds an ornithopter and flies across the Atlantic.  You still get "tinkerer" in there, you still get "heroic transatlantic journey," but now the details are viscerally impressive, rather than just cerebreally impressive.<br/><br/>Besides, Ethan Allen is cooler if the Green Mountain Boys ride moose into battle.                        </div>

                            So, yeah, wait.  Do you want people to try out your technique on other historical figures?  Or to suggest other ways for history to be awesome?  <br/><br/>I'm setting up an alternate-historical campaign now based on Naomi Novik's Temeraire novels where there are domesticated dragons throughout the world.  Apropos of Jonathan's comments, it's set at the same time as the Taiping Rebellion (around 1862 or so).  However, I'm planning on setting it not in China, but in Korea where there was another peasant rebellion going on along with the quiet founding of a new religion.  I was thinking of doing something smaller scale than the armies of millions, so the Taiping would only be background.  <br/><br/>I guess this is one of the things -- my last alternate-historical campaign didn't have any over-the-top stuff.  The PCs were all Icelanders in the New World, and mostly dealt with things like raiding villages, feuding, buying land, getting married, and so forth.  There were various alternate historical and mythological elements, but nothing wild like war machines or riding moose.                        </div>

YES! Thank you JBR for giving words to what I've been reaching for all along. Yes, I'm all over history already being awesome--no desire to get down on history here (otherwise, why would I sit up half the night reading history books for fun). But there's also that thing we gamers do when we look at something and say "yeah, but it would be even cooler with THIS".                        </div>

That is assuming that something awesome can't be made more awesome.<br/><br/>I hear ya, though.<br/><br/>I love it when we have totally different ideas about what makes something awesome or what we love about an old boxed set or what-have-you.                        </div>

He uses Cthugha's minions throughout his indian-fighting career, behaving so savagely in his suppression of the Lakota in 1891 that for a time he is taken off the line, and is viewed with deep distrust by his superiors - some of whom have an inkling of his secret "friends".  Despite his excellent record, Pershing struggles with promotion for many years.  When a Cree uprising appears imminent, Pershing is placed back in command in 1896 and the Cree voluntarily relocate to Canada.  He serves with terrifying effectiveness during the Spanish-American War in Cuba, becoming a fast friend of future President Theodore Roosevelt.  A political marriage in 1905 paves the way for his ascent to the upper echelon, and a  series of diplomatic appointments as military attache send him, with Roosevelt's unwitting patronage, to destinations of his choice - the Balkans and Japan, both seats of well-established Cthuga cults, with whom he worships, studies, and eventually clashes.  By 1914 Pershing is back in operational command, now responsible for border security with Mexico.  His conflicts with foreign cults motivate him to form a cadre of American worshippers, an effort that is brought into sharp relief when his wife and three daughters burn to death in a "mysterious fire" at their residence in San Francisco in August, 1915.  Heartbroken and by now quite mad, Pershing recruits eager young officers he encounters during the Mexican Punitive Expedition into his cult - junior officers like his staff Adjutant, George Patton, and a young turk named Douglas MacArthur.                        </div>

                            Yeah, it'd be a really fun campaign - you'd start off during the Mexican Punitive Expedition (first use of airplanes and motor recon elements, jump-started the careers of ... pretty much every general in WW2 except Eisenhower), and play it as a wainscot game from within the U.S. Army all the way to the second World War.  Do you really want to stamp out the American Cthugha cult, when they are going head-to-head with the Nazi/Chetnik Cthugha cult in Europe and Africa?  And the Japanese Cthugha cult in the Pacific?  Is the enemy of your enemy your friend?  Do you really want to do what it takes to get a position on Patton's general staff?  What the hell happened at Port Chicago?                        </div>

                            Emmanual Kant sets out to define the principles of pure reason. He's so successful that soon every university and salon on Europe is working on its own mechanical mind based on his work. But when Kant moves on to define the principles of morality he unwittingly discovers that right and wrong can be calculated by pure mathematics. In England the law courts are replaced by bronze calculating machines that provide verdict and sentence in seconds. The King of France employs a small army of clockmakers to build special compasses capable of detecting crimes and even unpopular political leanings at a range fo 50 yards. And what of a strange cult on the Baltic that claims it can induce anarchistic intentions just by reading a stream of numbers to an unsuspecting subject?                        </div>

                            Colin, John -- <br/><br/>Some history does not need much to 'awesome-ofy' it.  Seriously, the only additions I really made to Ethan Allen is that he and the Green Mountain Boys rode moose into battle and that he was a member of the secret society Sons of Liberty.  The rest -- the independent republic of Vermont, playing the US Congress and the British off of each other, the inciting rebellions within the US just to make a point -- is right out of history.  Ethan Allen is pretty straight-up and <em>obviously</em> awesome, so he needs less work.  Others, like Thomas Paine, <em>were</em> awesome all on their own, but were not <em>obviously</em> and plainly awesome.  You have to understand their historical context in order to understand their awesome.<br/><br/>Now, in a long-form game where you immerse and get to know the historical background and cultural context and everything, the players can learn how awesome these elements of history are.  For my purposes in this game, which is pick up and play and runs in one session, that's not an option.  <em>SoL</em> is high-color, visceral, and crazy-go-nuts so that it can be immediately appreciated.<br/><br/>(Now, as a tangent, if one effect of the game is to strike up a little interest in the players as to who these figures really were, and separating out the fact from the awesomofying fiction, that would be really neat.  It's one of my second-order hopes for the design.)<br/><br/>You could totally play a "straight" game set in the Revolutionary War and include and get to know the effect that, say, social networks played in the war (ie, they made the very war <em>possible</em>).  However, one way to get across that importance of social networks is to ratchet up the intensity of the facts.  Instead of "just" committees of correspondence, the game has this giant networking conspiracy that links together hundreds of patriots through diverse means including Freemasonry, Quilting Circles, churches, and artisan guilds.  The irony, of course, is that the fiction often comes around to being very close to the truth of the matter.  As another example, it's hard to get modern players to understand the impact of, say, artillery in the Revolutionary War (ie: this was the war where they kind of figured out how to use it effectively).  They're just cannon, right, and smoothbore manual-loading versions -- low tech!  How could that be revolutionary?  So my solution is to replace them with <em>freakin laser beams</em>, and the "point" is not lost.<br/><br/>To me, it boils down to two issues: time and taste.  In the time corner, awesomeofying history gets across the emphases faster than explaining the context of the facts.  In the taste corner... dude, George Washington in clockwork power armor on a clockwork horse.                        </div>

<p>What a coincidence! My favorite historical character from roughly the same time period as Harald is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egill_Skalla-Gr%C3%ADmsson" rel="nofollow">Egill SkallagrÃ­msson</a>, a berserker and skald. He got in a lot of trouble with Eirik Bloodaxe, partly because he kept killing Eirik's men, and partly because used sorcery to cast a curse on him and his wife. And then, as luck would have it, Egill was shipwrecked on the shores of England... <em>after</em> Eirik had been forced to relocate there himself. Eirik threw Egill in prison and sentenced him to death. Egill, before the next day, composed the <em>Hofudlausn</em> ("The Head-Ransom",) which was so damned good that Eirik freed Egill and forgave him for the bad blood between them.</p>
