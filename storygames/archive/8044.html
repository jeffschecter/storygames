There's already a hint of resentment that can build up if you're one of the first voted out of the game (usually because those first few lynchings are based on nothing but grudges, eliminating good players, and whim).  Adding money to the mix would really ramp up that element of the game.<br/><br/>That said, I would LOVE to watch a "professional" Werewolf game, played like a professional poker game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177436/#Comment_177436" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T13:15:51+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  1:15PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

Award the money to all Villager players if the Villagers win (even Villagers that were killed before the game was won), or all Werewolf players if the Werewolves win (even to Werewolves that were caught and killed during the game). This would make for higher stakes but wouldn't significantly distort gameplay motivations - and there wouldn't be resentment at being killed early (although there might be resentment from surviving players at those killed early taking a share of the prize money).<br/><br/>2. Alternatively, award money only to the surviving players who win. This would significantly distort the motivations for both the Players and the Werewolves (you have motivation to betray and/or kill those on your own side).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177470/#Comment_177470" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T16:55:57+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  4:55PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            also if your worried about the first player being kicked out and getting no prize and not wanting to award all players, you could split the kitty something like 70-30 so that the first person kicked out gets a small prize for being unpopular, which again makes a wierd (and valuable) contribution to the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177473/#Comment_177473" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T17:12:39+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  5:12PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>1.

As we had a couple of guys with money gaming (i.e. lottery, sports betting and stuff) design experience, we ended up with a bit more complicated game than what Thomas described earlier. The major changes were that audience participation was added (audience phone voting counted as one vote) along with optional limited insurances against killing (use of which lessened your potential winnings).<br/><br/>I probably have notes somewhere, I'll dig them up if I can.<br/><br/>BTW, nice to hear that someone, somewhere had the same kind of idea for a quiz show.
