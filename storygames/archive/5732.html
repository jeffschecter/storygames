It was nice to have our own private room, but it was sucky to be completely isolated and on the opposite side from the rest of the roleplayers.<br/><br/>Everything in the lounge was unscheduled. Yes, there were lots of cool indie stuff ALSO scheduled. Why the lounge then? Well, I like the social and back-n-forth nature of the informal, pitch-and-play kind of gaming. Was it necessary to isolate the two? I don't know. I wish there were more flow between the two groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128236/#Comment_128236" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T19:29:49+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  7:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

What about Conquest was it that got everyone jazzed? It doesn't sound like it's just the people that gamed there -- he states that if he goes to cons one reason is to hang out with friends. What about Conquest got everyone excited? He contrasts it with "spring break for geeks" -- what makes Con X the spring break for geeks and cons like Conquest NW, Go Play NW, or Gamestorm awesome cons? It sounded like you were going into this, but were sidetracked with the Lego/Mechaton discussion. But later when you came back, it sounds like it's because of the people that came to the con, not anything the con did.<br/><br/>I'm very interested in this as I'm part of an organization debuting a gaming convention here in Tucson over Halloween Weekend (RinCon '08).<br/></blockquote>\nSo if your group of people just up and went to a different con, would you have had the same awesome experience?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128286/#Comment_128286" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T21:43:15+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  9:43PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's how I replied there and to your email. (for those of you keeping score at home this is a triple-x-posting, but not the dirty kind)<br/><br/>It really is a sense of community that makes these events vroom. My advice is to set up a message board, get gamers really talking to each other, have several meet-ups for movies or dinner, or drinks, whatever beforehand, and make sure that people are really discussing what they're interested in playing and the kind of play they want.<br/><br/>The real life meeting part of this is really important. Even if not everyone can show up for every event, people knowing each other as real people with real names and real faces is an immense asset to community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128293/#Comment_128293" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T21:48:40+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  9:48PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thomas, the big thing for me is a move away from isolated tables where people get together, play a game, and then leave.... towards a set-up where socialization ramps up to "alright, I'm offering to run this, and Jim is offering to run that.
