It has a significant impact on my gaming experiences, and often lack of them, over the years.<br/><br/>It has wrecked large sections of my life since my early teens. It isn't fun. Explained simply, I will exhibit irrational compulsive behavior in certain social situations if certain triggers occur. It could be particular a word being spoken. It could be people looking at me too closely. Mostly I will want to conceal the huge panic and embarassment that hits me, and get away. One of my key triggers is sitting on a chair at a table with a bunch of people. This isn't about shyness. I'm very social, and I like showing off and getting attention. It's about a psycholocical dysfuction that kicks in out of nowhere and fucks stuff up for me. <br/><br/>I prefer to game standing up, if I can walk and move I'm much more likely to keep the panic under control. I'm a bit like that cowboy Paul Newman played... I shoot better when I move.<br/><br/>I've learned to manage it over the years, but it has never stopped. The best technique I have for dealing with it is to tell people in advance, and to tell them immediately if the panic gets out of control. I guess that's what I'm doing now...telling people.<br/><br/>I'm guessing that it's not just me, and I'd be interested to hear about any similar experiences that you may have had.<br/><br/>Sean.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somelady" title="somelady"><img alt="somelady" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somelady">somelady</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334834/#Comment_334834" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T18:03:23+00:00" title="July 16, 2011  6:03PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have post traumatic stress from when my son was born. Before I got into therapy I managed to trigger myself the first time I played Montsegur 1244, I played Phillipa, framed a birth scene and totally spaced out. Luckily everybody else picked up the ball and it didn't totally screw everything up. I'm not sure if they noticed that something was going on with me or if I was just narratively flailing. <br/><br/>I told this story to my therapist, and she said this kind of thing was actually somewhat common, because people can sometimes seek out the intense emotions associated with the traumatic event.<br/><br/>Since this isn't generally the kind of thing that comes up in most games (though I have two half baked game chef inspired ideas that are All About That) it hasn't had too much of an effect. Just generally if I'm playing Montsegur I bring up at the beginning that if the baby shows up the birth needs to be way offscreen. I've had a couple spikes of anxiety when general pregnancy stuff has come up, but the kid does also provide ample excuses to get away from the table if I need to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334839/#Comment_334839" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T18:47:53+00:00" title="July 16, 2011  6:47PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a thread about <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11316&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Gaming &amp; Mental Illness</a> about a year and a half ago.

Funny enough, none of my gaming buddies have ever complained of my manners OR my creativity, though...<br/><br/>More seriously, because of the social and attention issues attendant on the AS, I have trouble with large groups in tabletop. 4-5 people including the GM is the limit and even then people have to be reasonably respectful; if everyone's talking over each other or there's a lot of side-chatter, it adds to the confusion. Which is not to say I can't have fun in such settings, but I pay for it with exhaustion afterwards...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
