The main thing I see missing from it is the player.  It's mostly fictional inputs/outputs and a bit of how we get there.  Nothing about who at the table contributes, and how, and when.  If RPG play is a conversation and the rules are there to impact that conversation, then I think an accounting of the design space would do well to describe that.<br/><br/>Random examples:<br/><br/>\u2022 Freeform negotiate all the way to yes/no question, resolution system produces "yes" or "no".<br/>\u2022 Bid player currency to establish stakes, then roll to resolve that,<br/>\u2022 Resolution procedure provides constraints for the player to your left to narrate what happens.<br/>\u2022 You narrate successes, GM narrates failures, anyone else at the table narrates ties.<br/>\u2022 Failure means you lose your next turn.<br/>\u2022 Success means you lose your next turn.<br/>\u2022 On a 1 you have to tell the GM your character's darkest fear.<br/>\u2022 On a 6 we escalate without resolving, then cut away to leave the audience in suspense.<br/>\u2022 Narrate a flashback that prepared you for this and gain +1.<br/><br/>If that's a bit beyond the scope of what you're looking at with "resolution system", then I could boil it down a little:<br/><br/>\u2022 You talk.<br/>\u2022 GM talks.<br/>\u2022 Whoever was talking continues.<br/>\u2022 Whoever wasn't talking talks.<br/>\u2022 You must ask/answer one/some/all of these questions.<br/>\u2022 You must talk about X.<br/>\u2022 You can gain an advantage if you talk about X.<br/><br/>I hope this is useful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466195/#Comment_466195" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-11T01:52:27+00:00" title="September 11, 2017  1:52AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope this is useful criticism:<br/><br/>Unlike Mongrel, who is concerned about your approach being too conceptual, I feel that your conceptual framework here is much too narrow: resolution is just one part of the much bigger picture of how the game is structured systemically. Resolution mechanics come at the tail-end of a process of conceptualization, and it is impossible to consider them analytically without that full context. Game design is about creating a system of play, and as per the Lumpley principle, system is everything you use, not just a separated game mechanism.<br/><br/>For a more concrete description of what I mean, I'll say that when I'm choosing dicing mechanics, I do not do it by making an exhaustive index of the design space and then picking the optimal choice out of it. Rather, what I do is that I cross-correlate the top-down design requirements with the bottom-up usability constraints and ephemeral aesthetics; the concrete resolution mechanism is crafted basically full-cloth, as determined by the shape of those design constraints and informed by my prior experiences. It's not so much picking from a list as it is inventing while being informed of prior solutions to similar problems.<br/><br/>The fundamental reason as to why I don't think that it's useful to consider "resolution" in isolation is that it doesn't really exist in isolation. The reason that we think it does is simply that designers copy other designers, and thus most of the games we see out there seem to superficially have the same mechanical element, the "resolution system", in them. What is actually going on, though, is that every one of those games does, theoretically, have their own independent structures, and the presence of that resolution system is incidental, occurring because those games merely happen to have similar problems that require similar solutions. If we as designers presume that resolution in some ideal sense is present in every game, then we've nailed down a fundamental part of the design process before even starting. It's like you were an architect who decided that every building has arches and it's just a matter of choosing the best type of arch for every building; you'd be able to make good buildings as long as arches were the appropriate tool, but your theoretical basis would be actively harmful if you ever had to make a building that doesn't have an arch.<br/><br/>To prove my point, consider roleplaying games that do not have a resolution system for one reason or another. The examples are out there. <i>Once Upon a Time</i> is a good one, for instance.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's good to remember that everybody does this stuff with their own, unique style - design in general (as a discipline, far wider than just game design) is about complex conceptualization, and it is often the case that you cannot go directly into tool-building: you have to build the conceptualization tools  you use to create concepts first of all, and that's where we all need to create what we need individually. So it may very well be the case that my approach is just goobledigoob to you, and what you really do need for your design work is an exploration of a pre-determined design space [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466196/#Comment_466196" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-11T04:13:49+00:00" title="September 11, 2017  4:13AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2017 12:26PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, I noticed that you are basically talking about one type of game in your post. If you want to know what the design space is, I would suggest reading and playing different types of games\u2014explore the indie space more because that's where the diversely lies. There's no real design space because it is expanding with every game, but you can get a general idea of different modalities. So I suggest that you think about the aims of your game, once you understand your aims and expose yourself to more games you can start to get an idea of what type of mechanics might be appropriate and "what if" yourself into some interesting solutions you can playtest.

What is its context? What is its purpose? <br/><br/>Only once you see that can you start to figure out what fits in that negative space.<br/><br/>Thinking in terms of a black box with <i>inputs</i> and <i>outputs</i> can be really helpful.

For instance:\n<ul>\n<li>Allocating all dice simultaneously and preemptively (e.g. my Brawling skill is 3 dice, hoping the goblin holding me isn't too aggressive this round I'll use 2 to break free, 1 to hurt him and none to defend; meanwhile the GM allocates the goblin's 2 dice of Brawling skill to hold me tight because the goblin is relying on his archer friends to dispatch me). <br/>Secrecy is needed, and foreknowledge is rewarded. <br/>Lucky players take risks and are rewarded with unopposed large pools, prudent players look for balance and minimax strategies.</li>\n<li>Allocating dice sequentially and reactively (e.g. my Brawling skill is 3 dice; I commit 1 to hurt the goblin; the goblin is a risk-taker and prefers using 1 die to hold me tight rather than to defend; since I don't need to defend I use my second die to break free; then the goblin spends another die to hold me and I counter with another die to break free).<br/> Keeping track of initiative to select the disadvantaged characters who choose their actions first becomes necessary and rules about stealing and changing initiative are very important. <br/>Lucky players just roll dice better, with usually very contested objectives, and prudent players need to sacrifice some of their objectives to adapt to the choices of their opponents.</li>\n<li>Being able, or not, to optionally spend permanent resources to add extra dice to an important pool. <br/>Note the difference between doing it preemptively depending on player or character priorities, doing it because the opposition is pushing hard, doing it after rolling dice to improve results, etc.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466220/#Comment_466220" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-12T12:09:29+00:00" title="September 12, 2017 12:09PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your post reminds me of the work done by Whitson John Kirk III, Design Patterns of Successful Role-Playing Games <br/><br/><a href="http://legendaryquest.netfirms.com/books/RPG_Design_Patterns_9_13_09.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://legendaryquest.netfirms.com/books/RPG_Design_Patterns_9_13_09.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466224/#Comment_466224" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-12T17:01:05+00:00" title="September 12, 2017  5:01PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah - I believe that's the same book I linked to above.
