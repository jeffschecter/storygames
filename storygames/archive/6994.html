I don't see any movement toward diceless, let alone low crunch games - and the two are not the same thing. Nobilis is fairly crunchy, but it's diceless. In A Wicked Age is really low crunch, but uses all kinds of dice from d4s to d12s.<br/><br/>What I do see is a movement toward focused game design. There are more and more games that focus on doing a small number of things really well instead of trying to do everything decently. And D&amp;D4 has shown me that this just isn't a small press thing. Game design in general is moving forward.<br/><br/>My opinion is that trying to use as little of the system as possible means you are playing the wrong game. Use the system to its extend. If you're not getting the results you want, use another system. The results you are getting might be close enough that "another system" involves altering the game you're using. This might mean houserules, or it might mean cutting out rules. But deciding to cut out combat rules (for example) of a game doesn't mean you are playing that game and not using the rules as much, it means you are playing another game wth different rules.<br/><br/>So, the difference between "Calculus lol" and not using the system all depends on personal preferences. If it does what you want, then it's not going to feel cumbersome (or "crunchy") regardless of how detailed rules interaction turns out to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155955/#Comment_155955" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T17:20:04+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  5:20PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion has put me into a moment of Transcendent Thought:<br/>\n<br/>\nmore points of contact<br/>\n<br/>\nhow much attention do we need to pay here?<br/>\n<br/>\nhow slowly or quickly does this need to be addressed?<br/>\n<br/>\nis the fun in seeing how quickly or slowly this is going to develop?<br/>\n<br/>\nis this a game where manipulating these dice means victory? or are we looking for an uncertain outcome?<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat does "crunch" mean for fortune systems like Ron Edwards Spione? does it mean anything at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no answers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155980/#Comment_155980" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T20:19:18+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  8:19PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: grey.spiral</cite>There are only two types of systems in this world - rules-too-much/rules-not-enough, and rules enough.

My aim in roleplaying is to enact and create compelling stories. I think (at least for me) this can be described as my desired end condition for a rpg game (in the mechanics level). And to simplify things, let's look at games that basically have just some kind of conflict resolution where your resources are, well your resources with which to succeed. Which usually is your character status plus some story currency. (hang with me, I think I have a point)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if we have players and a GM, the players' desired story goals tend to align much more on their characters than the GM's story goals are aligned with potential NPC characters. And, generally the GM has a greater supply of resources (for example in Dust Devils just make up an extra NPC and you can use her stats in a conflict, though in PTA this is (wisely) limited).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, where does the crunch get into this? It basically gives each player different tactical options within the game mechanics to achieve different things in the fictional level. If you can't for example choose to use your weaker stat against an opponent you would like to face but would like your character lose to (or if you happen to win, win with a kind of miracle), your only option in the story level is to win. That can happen if the system does not have enough stats or something like that. The same goes for GM: he has to have enough options to affect the story towards his preferences, but probably should not be able to use the system to ram his ideas over the other players (that's why many people don't like task resolution, right?).<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought of this the day after our Dust Devils game came to its end. All the player characters met their end in the final session, because they felt like that would be the coolest thing to do at the time. They could do that because they had played in a way which allowed that option: Even though their stats were pretty good overall, each of them had decided to take damage during the earlier conflicts in a way that left a stat important to each of their characters to zero. And when the time was right, they plunged to their last desperate conflicts. That was way cool. And just enough crunch to allow this kind of story-level tactical thinking made it possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156174/#Comment_156174" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T00:45:13+00:00" title="July 12, 2008 12:45AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also mis-read this as Church or No Church and I voted No Church.<br>\n<br>\nBut, anyway, I like come crunch, just not too much.

They just weren't built for it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156215/#Comment_156215" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T10:36:45+00:00" title="July 12, 2008 10:36AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>I also mis-read this as Church or No Church and I voted No Church.</blockquote>\nI mis-read it as an admonition to "Crunch on no Church" and I went back to bed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156217/#Comment_156217" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T11:06:05+00:00" title="July 12, 2008 11:06AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>I play Hero.

I find "crunch" to be one of the strongest facets of classical roleplaying games. In building my classical FRPG Fabula into a game with more facets than the average classical RPG, I try to make it more "crunchy" in several fields, to make the fields of contact "drown" the players (a kind of immersion through system).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Z-Dog</cite>how much attention do we need to pay here?</blockquote>I believe this is THE field of design that needs to take top priority for classical RPGs to develop further. In modern RPGs such a design-focus would be premature, and possibly not ever a necessary one either.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Z-Dog</cite>how slowly or quickly does this need to be addressed?</blockquote>As quickly as we, the designers of these games, can make it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Z-Dog</cite>is the fun in seeing how quickly or slowly this is going to develop?</blockquote>Some fun, I imagine. Perhaps some frustration too, if it develops too slowly (for classical RPGs to actually get anywhere).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Z-Dog</cite>is this a game where manipulating these dice means victory? or are we looking for an uncertain outcome?</blockquote>It is a game where manipulating more than the dice is necessary, in order to make any winning design for the future. And the outcome is indeed uncertain. ;-)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Z-Dog</cite>what does "crunch" mean for fortune systems like Ron Edwards Spione? does it mean anything at all?</blockquote>I don't know. I've not tried Spione yet. Would like to. Ron Edwards is a man I find it essential to relate to as a designer.<br/><br/>Thanks for the open questions, Ken! My answers are one take on them, of course.
