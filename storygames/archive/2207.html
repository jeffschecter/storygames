                    Howdy, folks.<br/><br/>I need a little low-commitment help from anybody who's got ten or fifteen minutes to burn.<br/><br/>My current game-in-development, <em>Sons of Liberty</em>, is a wild romp through the American Revolution, loosely framed as "Dynasty Warriors meet the Founding Fathers."  To give you the basic idea of how the game plays, if you're playing Ben Franklin you can be sweeping the cobblestone streets clear of Redcoats by swinging around your electrified kite -- and if you're not cranking up the crazy to a commensurate level, you're playing it <em>wrong</em>.  The game is design to go to crazyland and fast.<br/><br/>The situation creation mechanic that I'm working with uses random draws of cards to determine elements of the players' Objectives (just like a level of Dynasty Warriors, right?).  Cards are looked up on a table to find words that are filled in to a mad-libs-like structure.  The players fill out the blanks and then briefly play the roles of Freemasonic Grandmasters discussing the progress of the conspiracy and revolution.  In other words, they apply a little human interpretation to the mad libs to knit them together.  Theoretically speaking, this produces a situation in ten to fifteen minutes, and then you're off and running.<br/><br/>The one face-to-face playtest I've had so far worked well, but with so many (52 x 4 = 208) elements that can go into a given situation, I'm slightly worried that there may be some bad apples in the random charts that won't work well in creating a situation.  That's where you come in.<br/><br/>I have a bare-bones web page that uses javascript (thanks, Jason!) to create <a href="http://kallistipress.com/SoL/objectives.html" rel="nofollow" target="sonsofliberty">Sons of Liberty Objectives</a>, just like pulling cards.  If you wouldn't mind helping me out, hit up the webpage and copy-paste the resulting objectives into a comment here, and then explain how the bits "obviously" go together in your hypothetical game.  I'm hoping that this can sniff out any problem items in the lists -- if somebody says, "I have no idea how to interpret this bit here" that's a pretty good sign that it needs to be tweaked or removed.<br/><br/>(Yes, there are a few little grammar hiccups, too.  Those aren't my concern right now, since they're more programmatic than conceptual.)<br/><br/>Thanks in advance, everybody!                </div>

                            Here's an example:<br/><br/>Primary Objective<br/>   1. The Sons of Liberty must incite an arms cache in Boston Harbor to prevent the British install a street gang!<br/><br/>Opportune Objectives<br/>   1. The Sons of Liberty can blackmail a lawyer while the British plant clockwork armor.<br/>   2. The Sons of Liberty can hide a preacher while the British introduce a battery of light cannon.<br/>   3. The Sons of Liberty can contact an apprentice after the British introduce an orator.<br/><br/>Secret Objective<br/>    * The Sons of Liberty must supply a fleet while the British lead an author!<br/><br/>And I get a tough one right off the bat, of course!  <em>Incite an arms cache?</em>  Well... with the understanding that the British are trying to sway the allegiences of one of the street gangs down in Boston Harbor, one can only assume that they are offering the street rats arms that they might not otherwise have access to.  Our operatives, then, must somehow interrupt that transfer -- and it seems like it's a delicate one, easily incited somehow.  I'm sure our boys in the field will be able to sort it out!<br/><br/>There are a couple opportunities for our agents to acheive that goal that we've already identified, as well.  The British are trying to manipulate the patent office in Boston to undercut colonial manufacture of clockwork armor -- they're trying to cut off our munitions before the war even gets started!  We know, however, the lawyer who they're working through, and we can threaten to expose him... and he may know something about the British running guns to the street gang.<br/><br/>The British are also moving in a battery of light cannon (think: clockwork-and-mirror powered lasers), which may distract them long enough that we can move in and extract poor Reverend Carter, who they are keeping tight surveillance on.  He works with the street gangs, and he may know one of the ruffians well enough to give our agents an opportunity to subvert the British plans.<br/><br/>The British are also trotting out that damned Tory orator Robert Montgomery, and we understand they're escorting him into Boston.  His runaway son Jeremy has recently left the street gang to take up an apprenticeship, and the appearance of his father may enflame his long-standing hatred of everything his father stands for.  Manuever him into an 'accidental' run-in with dad, and he may decide to help us out.<br/><br/>Lastly, (and the Secret Objective is actually a bit that the Grandmasters don't discuss, it comes later) it turns out that the British are trying to encourage Montgomery to publish his speeches.  They've already got the paper and presses set up -- paper and presses that our pamphleteers can certainly make use of.  We have a trio of smuggling boats in Boston Harbor, and it would be so simple to pinch those presses and squirrel them away for our own purposes.  If our agents can accomplish that without endangering their primary mission, all the better for the cause.                        </div>

                            Primary Objective<br/>
<br/>
This objective will determine victory or yet another setback on the road to liberty.<br/>
<br/>
   1. The Sons of Liberty must incite a soldier in Braintree to prevent the British teach Tories!<br/>
<br/>
I see this is pretty straightforward - the soldier and the teacher are the same guy.  He's a British army inventor who has created a crazy spring cannon, he's on the British payroll, and if he explains his latest invention to them all hell will break loose.<br/>
<br/>
Opportune Objectives<br/>
<br/>
These three objectives are means by which the Sons of Liberty can effect their plans. Choose your strategies well -- or dominate the battlefield by accomplishing all three.<br/>
<br/>
   1. The Sons of Liberty can embarrass a preacher after the British establish a double agent.<br/>
<br/>
The British persuade their tinkerer to offer his plans to the SoL - but it's an elaborate trap.  The only way to avoid it is to browbeat a Catholic priest who has heard the secret confession of the (closeted Catholic) British officer-inventor.  The priest has sins of his own...<br/>
<br/>
   2. The Sons of Liberty can contact a heliograph station after the British forge a sailing ship.<br/>
<br/>
Forging a sailing ship?  A steam ironclad, holy crap!  Can the SoL alert the secret base before HMS Gigantic arrives to flatten it?  It's a race against time - and the sun is setting!<br/>
<br/>
   3. The Sons of Liberty can coordinate slaves to prevent the British trick a tinkerer.<br/>
<br/>
The SoL have contacts in the British inventor's workshop - skilled slaves that work for him and have been bringing him 'round to the American side.  But the British have other plans for him!  It's up to the slaves to expose the deception before he reveals his latest invention - a spring cannon!<br/>
<br/>
Secret Objective<br/>
<br/>
    * The Sons of Liberty must rally a court before the British forge a spring mill!<br/>
<br/>
They are already building the mill to manufacture the critical component in the new cannon, and it can only be stopped through judicial intrigue - the land it is on has dubious ownership claims.                        </div>

I can work with most of this pretty well..<br/><br/>Primary: we've got some tories trying to get something important to some lawyer; my job to pin them down so that can't happen. <br/><br/>O1: this is a little harder to visualize.  They're teaching an orator... maybe somebody who's going to give a speech stirring up support for their side, and switching out the apprentice at the printer's shop will let us sub in some things that will mess it all up. But I kinda had to stretch to make that work.<br/><br/>O2: It would seem they're too busy rigging their station to notice that we can sail a ship right past their guards. <br/><br/>O3: This one is maybe sillier, but could be high-stakes conflict about whether somebody important gets embarrassed at teatime, which we can only prevent by getting his wife there with him to keep those Tories from bringing in a bawdy woman that will insinuate falsehoods over cucumber sandwiches.<br/><br/>So, some trickiness, but its all resolvable.                        </div>

The Sons of Liberty can inform a lawyer after the British mentor Mohawks.<br/><br/>Secret Objective<br/>1. The Sons of Liberty must disassemble an orator while the British contact spring boxes!<br/><br/>The main objective is pretty straightforward. The British are coming! With a newly armed fleet! We have to get to Boston in time to warn the courthouse so they can gather American forces to repel the invasion.<br/><br/>We have word that British agents are trying to capture Tom Paine, whose communications network will be invaluable for rallying our men in the region. We'll need to keep them guessing at his location so he can get his work done.<br/><br/>Number 2 is harder to understand. What comprises 'leading a fence'? The best I can come up with is that the British recently took down our best black market contact ('charging a soldier') and now we need to recruit another one, or else we won't be able to get the arms and supplies we need to repel the invasion.<br/><br/>We've gotten word that the 2nd prong of the British attack on Boston is a joint venture with the Mohawk Indians. Sky Horse used to be a member of the tribe, but has joined American society and learned how to be a lawyer in Boston. He's our best hope to convince the Mohawk to stay on our side, or at least make them delay until after we've dealt with the armada!<br/><br/>The Royal Governer of the Massachusetts Colony, the heartless Mechanical Man Sir Thomas Gauge, was broken in a freak accident! If we can infiltrate his mansion and completely disassemble him while the other colony officials are occupied trying to find replacement parts, it will be a great blow against their information network and coordination for the fleet's assault.                        </div>

OK. The British are negotiating with the Spanish in Florida, which they've only held since 1763 (thanks, Wikipedia). The Spanish want it back (and indeed will get it back in 1783 after the Revolution). They are trying to improve Spanish support against the colonists by offering a good deal on Floridan produce, which is currently loaded on a fleet of merchant ships. There's a deadline, however, because the Spanish official they're negotiating with is about to move on to greater things.<br/><br/>The Sons of Liberty, meanwhile, have inserted a mole into the negotiations. A British loyalist has discovered this and is trying to send a message via heliograph framing the mole for a crime. The British would then set up a kangaroo court with a specially selected jury to convict the mole, despite anything the judge might think or say; the Sons are trying to incite the mole to actually commit the crime on the "might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb" principle. The crime involves fraud over the Floridan produce, and the Sons are coaching the mole in how to falsify tax records, but the current location of the relevant tax records is unknown; the British must be decoyed into leading several minutemen who have volunteered as espionage agents to the location of the records.<br/><br/>The British informant who knows the mole's identity and can testify against him is himself vulnerable to criminal proceedings and, if not stopped, will jury-rig an ornithopter to fly to the island where the negotiations are taking place.<br/><br/>Or something. This is moderately hard, but definitely doable.                        </div>

Huh, interesting -- the Primary uses the same mix of prepositions as the Opportune Objectives.  You must have got a run of "befores" in the Primaries by pure chance.  I can grok that the "before"s are a little more immediately gripping; my thoughts with the "while" and "after" is that both give the Tory Player something to do, and gives context to the Patriots' actions.  "While" objectives will probably entail the Tories being distracted, as with your ornithopter introduce-a-spy thing (which was awesome).  "After" objectives will give the Tory player something to gloat about having just done, and an impetus for the Sons to act.  At least, that's the plan.<br/><br/>Thanks, everybody, for pitching in.  This is all great data and I'm very much paying attention.<br/><br/>From what I've seen so far, "lead" seems to be a recurrent problem.  It really muxes things up when it gets connected to an object that isn't people (as opposed to, say, <em>charge</em>, which works fine whether it's people or technology).<br/><br/>Mike's said that this is "moderately hard, but definitely doable" -- I'm wondering, is it entertaining?  (It may be that as a solo activity it's kind of drab, but at a table is more fun.)                        </div>

                            I think this would be a better group activity than solo because the objectives can be a little nebulous.  And that is a good thing because several people can sit around a table and decide exactly what the objectives mean.  That sounds like fun to me.<br/><br/>I haven't read anything about the game so I wasn't understanding much about the "Tory Player" vs. the "SoL Player" or groups of each.  Perhaps my comments about "before" and "after" aren't relevant there.  My comments were based on the players all being part of the SoL.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  OK, right now it reads like it was written in English, translated to Japanese and then translated back to English again. Barring that, here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Objectives from the Committees of Correspondence<br/>
<br/>
The correspondence from your brother Sons throughout the colonies have arrived. Franklin's "Whist Code" appears in one of them, signaling a key priorities. Decipher the import and dispatch agents to see to this needs immediately. The Revolution depends on you!<br/>
<br/>
Note: Idon;t know if any of this section is random, but it reads poorly, lol<br/>
<br/>
Primary Objective<br/>
<br/>
This objective will determine victory or yet another setback on the road to liberty.<br/>
<br/>
   1. The Sons of Liberty must plant tax records in the swamps after the British recruit an apprentice!<br/>
<br/>
Note: Huh? I mean, creatively, I could probably make something up for this. But my guess is that a group of players would all jump to different conclusions or make something different. If I had to run with this, I'd say that they were planting them somewhere a neutral 3rd party was and that when that 34d party discovered the records, they would join the revolution. But most of that is not up there...<br/>
<br/>
Opportune Objectives<br/>
<br/>
These three objectives are means by which the Sons of Liberty can effect their plans. Choose your strategies well -- or dominate the battlefield by accomplishing all three.<br/>
<br/>
   1. The Sons of Liberty can train a customs house after the British equip an ornithopter.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Um, I'm not sure how these are related, again, I could make something up, but it doesn't really set the situation. I could make up something about The British needing one more part to finish the Ornithopter and that part going through customs, but again, most of that is not in the description.<br/>
<br/>
   2. The Sons of Liberty can teach a lawyer while the British arm a spring mill.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Whoa, this one is tough. the only thing I can even think of to somehow link these to is maybe they are training the lawyer to get an injunction or cease and desist order against the mill's garrison forces. And even then it would depend on there being some British authority that doesn;t want to escalate the conflict...<br/>
<br/>
   3. The Sons of Liberty can build a horseless carriage to prevent the British smuggle an author.<br/>
<br/>
Note: this one is great! It is so easy to picture in your mind. The brits have already left and the only way to overtake them is with a horseless carriage, and its all right there in the setup!<br/>
<br/>
Secret Objective<br/>
<br/>
Only the Tory Player should view the following objective, and reveal it at his leisure during the game.<br/>
<br/>
    * The Sons of Liberty must blackmail a printing house after the British pin down a spy!<br/>
<br/>
Note: This is good too. Assuming the Tory is the British, I think its backwards, but either way, its obvious, the spy talked and stopping the presses is the only way to suppress what he knows.<br/>
<br/>
  For a totally random deal, its pretty darn good. A few grammar probs is a mild understatement. and I am not sure what to do with "after" does that mean that the event it describes has already happened before the beginning of the current situation?                        </div>

                            Primary Objective<br/><br/> <i>1. The Sons of Liberty must introduce an informant in Braintree while the British charge a Congressman!</i><br/>Don't know exactly what this would mean. My best guess is that the British have a informant in the form of a Congressman and they are charging him to start a duel with a famous author. This will unfold in Braintree, so the SOL need to head there ASAP and introduce an informant into the Congressman's entourage to find out how to stop him.<br/><br/>Opportune Objectives<br/><br/> <i>1. The Sons of Liberty can rally someone's mistress while the British destroy a ship captain.</i><br/>It just so happens that the Congressman's mistress is the informant and the British try to control her by threatening to  destroy her husband by reveling that she is adulterating.<br/><br/> <i> 2. The Sons of Liberty can deliver an author while the British deliver a fence.</i><br/>Meanwhile, an important author for freedom has been challenged to a duel by the Congressman in Braintree.<br/><br/> <i>3. The Sons of Liberty can supply a spring mill while the British embarrass spring boxes.</i><br/>A fledgling bed factory has sold the Congressman and the Captain box springs that have some sort of new fangled spying device in them. So, if the SOL can supply the company with enough incentive to switch to the cause of Liberty a new powerful friend may be found in the bedrooms of the powerful.<br/><br/>Secret Objective<br/><br/> <i>* The Sons of Liberty must convince a sailing ship while the British install Quakers!</i><br/>The mistresses Captain is in control of a sailing ship that is bringing Quakers to the colonies. These will be installed to help the British maintain control. The SOL must not let this happen.<br/><br/>This took me about 20 minutes, and it was pretty fun.                        </div>
