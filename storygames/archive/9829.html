This is a vanilla D&amp;D campaign - granted that it is run by someone I think is a damn good GM, but MOST popular? More popular than RPGMP3? Than Yog-Sothoth?<br/><br/>The statistician in me raises an eyebrow. There's no data to support or refute this claim, so the social scientist me has to go away unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Am I the only one who's curious about comparative podcast audiences? A lot of the netspace of the RPG hobby (as I experience it) is in podcasts. Unfortunately, there is no Louis Harris or Nielsen, so good information is hard to come by. I would be really surprised (and smugly satisfied) if Master Plan or The Podge Cast had more subscribers than the official WOTC D&amp;D podcast.<br/><br/>But there's no way to tell one way or the other.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218544/#Comment_218544" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T13:03:04+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  1:03PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There really isn't any way to tell, but I am almost certain that the D&amp;D podcast outranks anything in the gaming area I listen to.<br/><br/>You can share your download numbers but those are muddled and certainly overinflate listens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar" title="salvagebar"><img alt="salvagebar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar">salvagebar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218586/#Comment_218586" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T15:59:55+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  3:59PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right. Download numbers are only part of the picture. I know that RPGMP3.com puts out about 1.5 to 2 TB of audio every month through its two feeds. There are drops in downloads during the end of each semester; finals week, I imagine - which is interesting information all by itself. The only reason I know this is because the site admin was nice enough to chat with me and let me know.<br/><br/>I should just accept this as the landscape of the field I'm going into. It is hard to get useful data. Almost everything that is available is either published by parties with a vested interest, or the result of a poll of a self-selecting population. RPGs aren't the only example of this. I live in NYC, and I would <b>love</b> to research a paper about the economic impact of Off-Broadway theater. There are a lot of interesting cultural institutions I would like to look at more rigorously, but unless I come up with some clever way to get to the raw numbers, it isn't going to happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218592/#Comment_218592" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T16:41:52+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  4:41PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: salvagebar</cite>would be really surprised (and smugly satisfied) if Master Plan or The Podge Cast had more subscribers than the official WOTC D&amp;D podcast.</blockquote>\nMan alive, so would I.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>You can share your download numbers but those are muddled and certainly overinflate listens.</blockquote>\nI subscribe to the Tevis idea of "yes they are, but since we're all using the same muddled metrics, it's not a bad comparison."<br/><br/>I recall seeing that claim with they came on RPGPodcasts.com (which I maintain). I chuckled -- I mean, podcasters are a mouthy and often egotistical sort by some degree. Their claim is about as valid, if you will as my subtitle of "The People's Podcast about Game Design."<br/><br/>Also, here's a thing about "most popular" -- that claim tends to reinforce itself, because it draws listeners. So, even if it's not, it's good, cheap marketing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkReed" title="MarkReed"><img alt="MarkReed" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkReed">MarkReed</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218598/#Comment_218598" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T17:15:44+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  5:15PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well first I would like to thank my friend for the comment about being a good GM, I try and I hope it does show.
