I've gone with a lifepath approach, with the idea that people are a product of their environment and relationships.  It's still at the unformatted stage and will make no sense if you don't understand AW (other than the character sheet and MC notes at the end).<br/><br/>Other odd factors - the driving PC engine is meant to be the stress economy (which needs testing), and I've gone with AW:TDA style damage, and an Anti Hammerspace encumberance system (there's meant to be a blank character portrait but that will take time to get the proportions right).  The Read a Person equivalent move is adult only (until midseason) - and adults start with an extra stat and move but level at half rate.<br/><br/>I need to playtest the Stress Economy, and I'm seriously considering grouping the districts and making them less explicit to The Hunger Games.  14 is just too many and far, far too tied to the setting.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IZN2EYB5p96fdbIdY5kiRujanNZDgaYZuvX6FGQGIVM/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IZN2EYB5p96fdbIdY5kiRujanNZDgaYZuvX6FGQGIVM/edit</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429566/#Comment_429566" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T08:22:56+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  8:22AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2014 8:24AM by James_Stuart.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's some cool stuff here.<br/><br/>I think the part which I want more focus on: "How do you deal with the ultra-high lethality?" and the answers are: "Well, the PCs are powerful enough that they'll survive to the end naturally." or "Find some non-standard, non-solo winner scenario."<br/><br/>When really, I would want the game to answer "What happens when somebody dies in the first 30 minutes of a session?" I'd even like to see this embrace a "hey, don't get too attached to this character!" feel. You don't know who are going to be the heroes going in, being a favorite doesn't matter. It would be cool to spend the pre-Arena part building collectively as a group the tributes as a whole, such that every death feels meaningful, and a bit shocking, and like a story was cut short.

I'm not feeling a clear narrative purpose to the game. I'm cool with Monster of the Week focusing on the "how do you find clues?" and "how do you fight the monster?" elements, because it's monster-hunting. But to me, Hunger Games was about how the Games stole your humanity (Haymitch's hollowness and alcoholism), and about how the contestants found humanity in the midst of horrible things (Rue and Katniss' relationship). It was about the cost, the toll of fighting, and about how you find hope in the middle of all that.<br/><br/>So I wanna see more of that.

I'm doing my best to control the emergent gameplay through the rules while distracting people into the glitz of the Hunger Games the way most of the promos do.<br/><br/>If I've got things right (and I know it'll take fine tuning), the driver to the game is <i>stress</i>.  Stress, people breaking down, and how they are pushed and how they crack under pressure.  The stress track is meant to look relatively mild and in practice to really break the characters down - but in the opening session they should be used to being able to spend stress almost freely.  I might need more teeth behind the pressure valves, but that's where that hook is.  Breaking them down (note that the only stat that doesn't take a hit on one is Strong, which is incredibly valuable in the arena but almost useless outside).<br/><br/>The finding humanity in the midst of horrible things has two drivers.  First no Tribute can win on their own.  That's part of the purpose behind the Pack, and the District 2 Tribute rules. You need allies.  Allies in the midst of that, who could cut your throat in your sleep, when the explicit rules say that only one can win.  Second, I'm trying to point the game that way by what the Tributes <em>can't</em> do.  Tributes explicitly have no access to the "Read another person" move until a long time into the game.  There is quite literally no mechanical way for one Tribute to know they can trust another.  You have to roleplay it out.  (The only exception being the 7-9 Aid Other: Expose yourself to truth).  Finally, with two surviving PCs, the Hunger Games end with a cross between Prisoner's Dilemma and chicken.<br/><br/>So we have a game that looks like a PvP game <i>that you can not win by playing pure PvP</i> - so you need to trust another person but have no mechanical ability to do so.  Your only possible choice if you are playing to win is to roleplay it out.  The humanity.  The trust in the midst of the horrible situation.  And either the trust to the last, each being willing to die for the other, or the final betrayal.<br/><br/>The team game is purposely a whole lot less intense although it uses the same rules.  It's in part there to bury the intended game still further, although if people want to play it as written that's fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429574/#Comment_429574" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T11:26:31+00:00" title="March 18, 2014 11:26AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the dynamic in the All-Tribute Game of "Hey, we've set up these largely unsympathetic tough as nails NPCs that you'll need to work together to fight." versus "Hey, you know, you could backstab another player, and then if one of you wins, the other player gets to sit at the table idly for the next few hours." doesn't seem like a super interesting choice in trust. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429576/#Comment_429576" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T11:34:26+00:00" title="March 18, 2014 11:34AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might have a point - it really depends on the group.

Most of it doesn't look like a PvP game, though. And I guess that's mostly in GM framing--but the moves are all framed as if they'd be player-vs-environment. That's my gut feel, anyhow. It also seems like it'd get shaky if things turned to PvP, mechanically. I'm a lot more okay with forcing an NPC to cower based on a move that I roll than I am with forcing a PC to cower because of a move they didn't make.<br/><br/>Hmm. Looking at it again, I think the moves that strike me oddly are the ones which refer to specific situations, like "Shoot Someone", "Set a Trap", and "Fix an Object". What role are they planned on playing in the hack? (Then again, that might just be my fondness for universally-useful moves. I adore how well they're set up in Monsterhearts, where you could drop any move into any situation.)<br/><br/>I definitely like the Stress mechanic. I'm not sure how it fits into the rest of the game, though.<br/><br/>It strikes me that it might be interesting to put a spin on the character bonds mechanic (which seems to pop up in every AW hack in some form) where your character bonds deal with how you're able to exploit other characters through your relationship with them, instead of using Help Someone Out. That might be the sort of element I'm missing here: a way that the hack riffs off of the relationships between characters, and their meaning. (Again, I guess Monsterhearts is really my gold standard here--how strings evoke the idea that those closest to you have the most advantage over you.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429583/#Comment_429583" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T14:00:43+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  2:00PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Set a Trap, I thought I'd fixed that!  Try now.  Cowering isn't something you force - the person being bullied chooses the consequences.  (Or you can willingly cower to make yourself non-threatening).<br/><br/>You're absolutely right about the other two moves.  On reflection I don't think Fix an Object should be a generic move.  If there's an object that needs fixing, the Gamemaker probably saw that it was so.  They can create the custom move.  And I've replaced Shoot Someone with Hunt or Stalk.<br/><br/>You're also absolutely right about bonds.  Katniss' only pre-existing bond with someone central was with Peeta.  (Gale and Prim weren't seen after the opening chapter in the first book).  So I've replaced it with a Trust and Betrayal mechanic that ties in to the stress table.

Sorry, my instincts start really negative, and I need to work on giving that room to breathe and get some perspective. And that's a good point--I think there's a couple non-threatening options that assume authority over another character's actions ("they aren't contemptuous" and "they don't take a free shot", along with their negative pairs), so you might want to revamp that one.<br/><br/>Hunt or Stalk is excellent. Also more evocative, I think, of how the Tributes fought.<br/><br/>I like the idea behind Trust and Betrayal; I might simplify it down to a single unloaded category, though: "Bond". Or something better-worded. Here's my thoughts on how I'd tweak what you have...<br/><br/><i>You may take a Bond with another character at the cost of 1 Stress. When you rest in a place where you're Bonded with everyone, you recover Stress as if you were one row higher. Anyone whom you've Bonded with (i.e., you have a Bond with them on <b>your</b> sheet) gains +1 ongoing to rolls against you. You may break a Bond at any time by taking 1 Stress; erase it from your character sheet.</i><br/><br/>Then maybe include a move like this...<br/><br/><i>When you <b>turn on someone</b>*, roll and take +3 forward if they have a Bond with you. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose 1.<br/>\u2022 You break your Bond with them, but don't take Stress.<br/>\u2022 You deal harm as established.<br/>\u2022 They take -1 forward.<br/>\u2022 They take -1 ongoing against you until they break their Bond with you.<br/>\u2022 You give them a command; they mark XP if they obey it.</i><br/><br/>*I really need to find better wording. Or maybe it's just that I keep thinking of Monsterhearts.<br/><br/>Or something like that. Let the players figure out what "trust" means in the context of the game. If you're breaking a Bond, does that mean you consider someone a traitor? Are you preparing for the worst? Are you really willing to Bond with everyone, when that opens you up to attack?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429589/#Comment_429589" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T14:58:15+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  2:58PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice suggestion, Andy.

I definitely want to start some thoughts going on this. I agree with the notion of not codifying every important theme, and using the rest of the mechanics as wedges towards the real core themes. I like to suggest things that'll simplify and amp up those wedges.<br/><br/>(A lot of my simplification streak actually traces back to my long history with boardgaming. I've seen a lot of systems, and the ones that are elegant and efficient with their levers are always the best. Also, the ones that give you concrete reminders of mechanics, aka everything Fantasy Flight does, work the best in my experience. So tying a mechanic to something you write on your sheet works well. I think that was the impetus behind my suggestion of a single written Bond for a player.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429598/#Comment_429598" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T17:39:03+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  5:39PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simpler is almost always better, but complex is <i>so</i> much easier to write.

And a half-baked idea: you know how they replay a tribute's backstory when they fire the cannon for them? What if you enshrined a dead PC with a similar memorial? (It'd also be interesting to put a Capitol styling on the memorial, instead of making it something humanizing.

I was stirred by James' statement: "It would be cool to spend the pre-Arena part building collectively as a group the tributes as a whole, such that every death feels meaningful, and a bit shocking, and like a story was cut short."<br/><br/>That last sentence leads me to your other idea: Backstory/Memorials.  Defo.  Right now I'm picturing something like the "Aftermath" segment of FIASCO, except you could step through the character's developmental stages and then into highlights from the game itself: "Shot of Marena as a little girl learning to use a bow.  Shot of Marena bringing in her first kill at age 8.  Shot of Marena in the soy fields, playing with her brothers.  Shot of Marena the day she was accepted as a Pledge.  Shot of Marena's first scoring move.  Shot of Marena getting hit by the bolt trap on Day Two of the games.  Shot of Marena hiding in the trees to avoid being seen while wounded.  Shot of Marena receiving her first and only gift from a sponsor.  Shot of Marena getting ambushed by Trake.  Shot of Marena's death scene."<br/><br/>Maybe throughout the course of play, whenever something particularly moving or photogenic happens, the MC can make a one-line note of it.  Later, should the character die, these one-liners would become the content of her memorial.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430129/#Comment_430129" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T19:54:40+00:00" title="March 27, 2014  7:54PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've changed the bond mechanic - there's now no betrayal.
