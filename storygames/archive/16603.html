We think this rule has the potential to really improve some difficult or sensitive subjects, while at the same time nearly impossible to abuse. So we are applying it here at Story Games.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s the rule: It is called \u201c<b>SLOW DOWN</b>\u201d.<br/><br/><b>===== RULE BEGINS =====</b><br/><br/><b>SLOW DOWN</b><br/><br/><b>Intention:</b> When discussions get heated, sometimes people talk past each other and stop listening. Or people \u201cgain ground\u201d or \u201cwin\u201d the discussion simply because they have far more free time to post, and post to the point that other voices are drowned out. Traditionally, we have Sunk or Closed these threads when they got out of hand, but we\u2019re going to try a new method out. It is a tool to foster listening, thinking and empathy before replying to hot issues.<br/><br/><b>Implementation:</b><br/>* The discussion\u2019s creator and the admin team can turn Slow Down on, or turn it off.<br/>* If the discussion\u2019s creator (or admin) believes that the discussion is getting heated and people aren\u2019t listening (or are posting too quickly without reflecting, etc), they can start Slow Down by creating a post in the thread which simply says something to the extent of:<br/>\u201cHey everyone, I\u2019m turning on Slow Down. Please abide by the rules for Slow Down\u201d.<br/>(and add a link to the Slow Down rules to this post)<br/>* This can be used at the start of a thread, if you think the discussion is likely to be contentious. However, do not overuse this feature.<br/>* The discussion creator or admin edits the first post in the thread: They change the Thread Title, adding the words \u201c[SLOW DOWN]\u201d at the beginning of the discussion title.<br/><br/><b>Ex:</b><br/>\u201cI had a weird experience at a convention\u201d ---&gt; \u201c[SLOW DOWN] I had a weird experience at a convention\u201d<br/>* If Slow Down was started by an admin, then an admin can stop Slow Down.<br/>* If Slow Down was started by the thread/discussion creator, then only they (or an admin under unusual circumstances) can stop Slow Down.<br/>* To turn off/stop Slow Down, the creator or admin simply creates a post to the extent of:<br/>\u201cHey everyone, I\u2019m turning off Slow Down\u201d<br/>* Then, she can edit the thread title, removing the words \u201c[SLOW DOWN]\u201d from the beginning.<br/><br/><b>Slow Down Rules:</b><br/>* During a period of Slow Down, from the point of the \u201cI am implementing Slow Down\u201d post\u201d onwards, each participant only gets to post **one single public reply in the discussion per 24-hour day**. If you\u2019re wondering the start point of that \u201cday\u201d, use your own time zone. If there is contention on this point, then the \u201cday\u201d will begin 24:00 GMT/UTC.<br/>* There are no exceptions. If the admin or discussion creator revokes the Slow Down status but requests that the posters follow additional rules or guidelines throughout the thread, follow them.<br/>* For further communication with thread participants during a Slow Down period, we highly encourage people continue communication or take their discussion to other channels like private whispers, email, G+, etc.<br/><br/><b>Caveats:</b><br/>* If the admin believe that the discussion creator is implementing SLOW DOWN in a way not representative of its intentions (Ex: To \u201cwin\u201d an argument; and not to foster better communication) we\u2019ll whisper or email them our thoughts in a private warning.<br/>* Don\u2019t re-edit your post to respond to things that people say after your post; simply reply the next day if you felt like you had more to say.<br/>* Do not harass the discussion creator regarding their decision to implement Slow Down. If you suspect misuse, contact an admin.<br/>* If an admin and the thread creator differ in opinion as to when Slow Down should be started or stopped, the admins will discuss this with the thread creator in private.<br/>* We will also address overuse of the tool: If one person uses it to a degree we find too frequent, we\u2019ll address that in private. Frivolous overuse can lead to private warnings, up to removing your privilege to institute this rule.<br/>* If you have questions or concerns about the use of Slow Down in a thread, whisper or contact an admin.<br/><br/><b>===== RULE ENDS =====</b><br/><br/>Note: In the forum software we use, \u201cThreads\u201d are called \u201cDiscussions\u201d, which is why we alternate between talking about the original \u201cthread creator\u201d and \u201cdiscussion creator\u201d (same thing).<br/><br/>Hopefully we won\u2019t need to use this for some time. <b>If you feel the need to try it out, PLEASE DON\u2019T*. That\u2019s not the point.</b><br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* Don't be that guy who immediately creates the most contentious thread possible with the sole purpose of wanting to test drive this rule.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379954/#Comment_379954" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T12:09:30+00:00" title="May 28, 2012 12:09PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If being told to "Slow Down" makes you upset, I suggest taking a few minutes to distract your monkey brain with this video by some nice lads from Manchester.<br/><br/><b>Virus Syndicate: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PhjR_V0lf0" rel="nofollow">Slooooooow Dooooown</a></b> (Youtube).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380018/#Comment_380018" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T02:14:08+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  2:14AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><b>If you feel the need to try it out, PLEASE DON\u2019T*.

However, Slow Down itself is more of a tapping on the breaks usually almost as a response to overposting, those threads about important but sensitive issues that we want to require people to think about for a few mins before posting.<br/><br/>What I would suggest in your case there is to simply set such a rule in your opening post, creating special rules for "your thread". As long as you're not being an asshole about it, people should follow those rules. <br/><br/>For example, check out what I did here in this thread:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XOY7lsBVpo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XOY7lsBVpo</a><br/><br/><b>"OK, What was D&amp;D 4E _TO YOU_? One Post, No Responses, READ THE THREAD RULES!"</b><br/><br/>I want folks to be able to set the conditions for thread participation if they want to. I specifically called out the rule of the thread and "READ THE THREAD RULES" to make sure folks did just that. Admittedly, in this above case (which came during a trying period of moderation) I was specifically backing up the rule with admin actions ("If you don't follow these rules your thread will be deleted!") because at the time I thought it might come to that. But folks really did participate in that thread as expected. It was--to use the terms of the forum where I learned a lot about the good and bad of implementing social rules--a "fishbowl thread"*. The OP can set the conditions of participating in the thread, and can bring it to our attention if posters are not following those rules in good will.<br/><br/>We've had a history of such a thing in the past. Early on in the forums we had a crisis of conscience at one point where people were noting that they were creating threads but not receiving the responses they wanted, where a thread started by someone else might be getting "awesome" responses, lengthy responses, on-target responses, etc. It was discovered that it was mostly due to the original poster having an idea of what kind of posts they wanted, but not specifically calling out that fact: Basically hoping that repliers understood what the poster was hoping for, rather than specifically saying, "I'm mostly interested in the following kinds of replies..."<br/><br/>So, if you have a thread which doesn't deal with these sensitive/contentious issues, but is of a gaming topic where you want to encourage people thinking by setting some kind of rule like "You only get one post" or "You only get one post per day" or "You can talk about as many games as you want to, but please divide them into One Game Per Reply", "I want a game recommendation for these criteria, but please write specifically why you are recommending it", etc.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* (preview: We may be implementing more rules soon like Fishbowl or other K-F classics that weren't twisted/abused, which did improve the climate overall)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380049/#Comment_380049" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T09:48:41+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  9:48AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm willing to give it a shot but I question the agenda here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380061/#Comment_380061" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T10:43:50+00:00" title="May 29, 2012 10:43AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arpie, you should consider asking the Gente Che Gioca people who post here about their experiences with Slow Down.

Or people \u201cgain ground\u201d or \u201cwin\u201d the discussion simply because they have far more free time to post, and post to the point that other voices are drowned out. Traditionally, we have Sunk or Closed these threads when they got out of hand, but we\u2019re going to try a new method out. It is a tool to foster listening, thinking and empathy before replying to hot issues.<br/>-----<br/><br/>But, what does that actually fix? It's one thing to hear a description of this behavior but another to actually see the specific behavior. So without specifically opening up any old wounds, let me point out some specific behavior patterns we've seen that we're using this to fix:<br/><br/>1) Say there's a discussion on issues of race/racism in gaming or something. Like, for example someone brings up "a potentially problematic portrayal of asians", and Jeff Z or Chris Eng (theG33k) post. or "a potentially problematic portrayal of India" and Dev or Shreyas post. Or a discussion on women in OSR gaming and Kira or Giulia post. Or questions about socialism in scandanavia, and Eero or Mattjis post.<br/>Obviously, these people are going to have interesting, poignant and often personal experiences which differ from the majority of us: White, mostly American or English-speaking, males. ostensibly, these are the very people we want to be hearing from (and of course their experiences are going to differ from each other; but at the same time, they're "closer" to the issues being discussed).<br/>* We want to encourage people to speak up and share their experiences, particularly the people with a close or personal connection to the subject. Great.<br/>* The thread goes on, it gets lots of eyes, it is a sensitive topic and many people have opinions on it. So people start to post. Rapidly.<br/>* Some white male dudes have a lot of experience with the subject, and make a post with lots of solid facts. No problem.<br/>* A lot of people have their very strong opinion, and make their posts. They then start arguing with each other, or with the people posting from personal experience. Thread gets flooded.<br/>* Sometimes "white knights" show up, well-meaning people who lack the deep experience/knowledge of the subject but who basically try to speak on behalf of others, which also takes the attention away from the people who have personal experiences with the subject matter and puts the spotlight on themselves ("I'm a white guy, but I'm going to go ahead and speak on behalf of the oppressed women/minorities/whatevers here"), either unintentionally or Totally Intentionally.<br/><br/>At this point, the people with the personal experience and ties to the matter: They've spoken! And some people hear them. And the thread becomes better for their contributions. But the more back-and-forth that happens from the other participants ("I don't have knowledge or experience, but I have a strong opinion on the matter!" "I object to your opinion, and will micro-quote you in order to destroy your argument." blah blah blah) starts to slowly drown out the conversation.<br/><br/>Now, already things are a little ugly. Add to that this commonly seen behavior that pushes things over the top:<br/><br/>* The people with the easiest (or nonexistent) day-jobs, who have the most free time, the most personal drive/illness to stay on the internet and argue with people, start to post. And post. And post. They start to reply to every single other post in the thread, effectively doubling the size of the thread and ultimately contributing little more than defensiveness. A new post is made, and this person responds to that post in a matter of minutes or seconds, not thinking or reflecting on the "overall big picture" of what's happening in the thread. Those posts from the people who have personal ties to the subject matter don't just get flooded, they get buried. <br/>* Somewhere around this time, the additional snark starts on all sides, the posts that are meant to be a quick stab at the "other side". Single-sentence dismissals, "picture memes", etc.<br/><br/>At this point, it's really impossible for those folks (the ones with the personal ties to the material, and those who want to hear them further) to participate meaningfully anymore. And that aggressive posting was the one consistent behavior that kills those threads. The snark posts are problematic, but it doesn't make sense to moderate those people, because this behavior is almost always symptomatic of the other stuff listed above. It's like the elevated body temperature that is symptomatic of the fever. I could get mad at the thermometer (and hey, some thermometers are assholes**), but I should probably treat the underlying illness too.<br/><br/>We normally Sink or Close those threads: Those are the tools in the toolbox which this software provided to us. But ultimately, it's extremely unsatisfying to do so. Because it basically not only kills the thread and stops the heavy-unreflective-posters dead, it also further buries the solid or interesting contributions of the people who really provided something real and meaningful to the thread, which sucks.<br/><br/>If I had heard of this rule a few years ago, I totally would have totally implemented it then! C'est la vie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, instead of this extremely elegant solution (again brought to our attention by Giulia who didn't create the rule but saw its history, to which I'm super grateful: It was definitely a satori moment there), in the past people would simply suggest stuff to the likes of "Hey, make those people who I disagree with Shut Up!" Which, hey, can be okay sometimes (and it's always okay on private blogs or spaces!), until you get into one of those situations like:<br/>* Where "both sides" are actually saying meaningful stuff but not listening to each other (Who do I make shut up? You both have awesome points, but you both are also kinda being assholes). <br/>* Or where the tools of silence are used to Silence the wrong people or for really iffy/ugly reasons ("This woman/PoC over there is sharing her personal experiences, but her background and opinion disagrees with mine, and thus is obviously incorrect and makes her an Enemy. Make her shut up!").<br/><br/>Making people shut up requires a lot of research and time to make sure you're doing it to the right people for the right reasons.<br/><br/>But making people listen (time limits for posting, other social rules) before posting--or at least forcing a situation where they have nothing to do but listen (and admittedly they can choose not to)--requires very little work at all. <br/><br/>And I don't have any problem with an agenda of Making People Listen More, or to trying to dislodge unreflective lizard-brain internet posting behavior to try to wedge in a chance for some empathy to sink in.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/>** Metaphors are awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380125/#Comment_380125" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T16:40:08+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  4:40PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2012 4:40PM by Nathan_H.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, have you seen the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower_%28film%29" rel="nofollow">Shower</a>?

For you, I mean.<br/><br/>(The following being, obviously, my humble opinion and not representative of anything else\u2026)<br/><br/>\xb7 "Slow Down" rules are based on the assumption that posting more than once a day in a discussion thread is common, so much in fact that posting in it 1/day is "slow" and enforcing this cap is a significant limitation. This view is already skewered, as in "stemming from a serious general internet addiction". This may be true, in that the only individuals who <i>personally suffer it as a restriction</i> are indeed the internet-crazed and the loud\u2026 But, on the other hand, the true malicious troll is patient (not otherwise having a life to attend) and deviously cunning and will, under a slowdown, bid his/her time and load a shot for maximum damage. This while any well-meaning posters who get caught in the argument may not have the surplus of time and dedication required to craft a poignant, flawless contribution out of their 1/day post (and was actually likely to have that same posting rate or a slower one anyway). Against individual, malicious trolls I think the Slow Down is only so-so effective.<br/><br/>\xb7 One area where I think the Slow Down trick does shine is in case of heated arguments between two otherwise well-meaning users, who quickly escalate their misunderstanding to insult or personal attacks. Invoking a Slow Down is likely to preempt the above from happening - simply because the heat is not allowed to escalate that quickly, there being enforced "cool down" breaks - or at least stop it eventually, if it has begun already. In the latter case, though, I doubt it can stop it soon enough, before every other user quits that particular thread.<br/>But! The moderators already have a large toolbox available for dealing with this (not exceedingly common) case: whispering/private messaging the offenders, e-mailing them, calling them out and reining them in, hiding their posts from other users (through whisperizing), SINKing a thread or even closing it\u2026 Some combination of the above is sure to be effective, in any given case, thus I'm not sure how much value the one new tool which is Slow Down really adds.<br/><br/>\xb7 What I believe the Slow Down is totally ineffective/utter crap at, is, protecting the minority voice in a conversation. It doesn't really matter, here, whether the minority voice is being maliciously and deliberately silenced by a vocal majority, or as it so often happens privilege cannot see itself and the arrogance manifests unknowingly\u2026 Either way, dog-piling on somebody in slow-motion is still dog-piling them \u2014 the minority-to-majority ratio of voices stays exactly the same. I suspect sometimes it may even make it worst - that ill-equipped "white knights" actually deal double damage (to their ostensible friends) in a slowed down thread, and that there are a few special tricks a malicious poster can play with Slow Down to bully a minority-PoV user - but that would be more "gut feeling" than science.<br/><br/>\xb7 Additionally, and related to the above, Slowing Down a thread can be a "coup out" by the moderation team: by invoking it, a moderator is "taking action" with no need of naming names, taking sides or passing any value judgments. Using it assumes it's only the tone of the conversation which needs moderating, or that there's a misunderstanding happening, but that everything will eventually take care of itself as soon as people cool down a bit. Except that some things don't ever take care of themselves. What when it's the content of the conversation, not just the tone, which is inherently flawed? Such as when a majority is dog-piling on a minority PoV and/or being apologetic about their privilege? In these thorniest of threads to moderate, it's tempting for moderators to impose a Slow Down an hope things are eventually going to fix themselves - except they won't. It turns into an excuse for lack of actual moderation.<br/>And that's why Slow Down is, potentially, a moderator trap.<br/><br/>\xb7 Additionally, people being able to tag their threads with [Slow Down] from the onset: it carries some risks. It can lead to people posing: "Look, my topic's so controversial and edgy I'm putting it under Slow Down!". Worst, it can lead to apologetic use, as placing a "Slow Down" tag on it suddenly makes any topic OK - not careful consideration of the topic, not basic empathy, not a burning awareness of one's privilege: what it takes is just a tag. Thus, "Slow Down" easily becomes an excuse for inconsiderate behavior.<br/><br/>I used to think it was a good tool, at first, but soon enough changed my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380130/#Comment_380130" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T17:49:53+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  5:49PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking as someone who typically lurks because I don't feel I have the time/energy to get invested in what can sometimes become explosively fast debates here I'm pretty happy about this rule.

This may be true, in that the only individuals who<i>personally suffer it as a restriction</i>are indeed the internet-crazed and the loud\u2026</blockquote>\nThis is almost always the case. The "ratio of people posting" isn't the problem, it's the few people in the thread in the above scenario who keep adding content without listening. One person generating 10 unreflective posts in an hour, getting 10 more replies from others and continuing the cycle. It isn't so much the Number of angry internet people, white knights (though that was a good point), etc; it's each of these very reactive and passionate people posting five times an hour each all at the same time.<br/><br/>Also, the issue isn't about "The malicious troll". It doesn't seem to be maliciousness that drives this, just lack of listening and self control for otherwise good people.<br/><br/>All the other scenarios you mentioned we've already accounted for, including the one where we use it as a cop-out. We will still take action if things get shady on top of the new rules. We'll just have to see what happens.

But the forum works on strict rules about "thread self-policing": when someone start a thread he/she have to give the "thread rules" (what it's for, what kind of feedback is wanted, who can post, etc.) and the Slow Down is an option like any other. There is no need of any special motivation, "I don't have the free time time to write more than a reply every day" is enough and it's not even needed as an explanation.  I never noticed any kind of problem caused by it<br/><br/>The slow down is not so much a "weapon" for the moderators, as a way to keep the signal to noise ratio in the forum to a higher standard. (associated with the forum-wide ban of multi-quoting)<br/><br/>The correspondent "weapon" for the moderators is the "Time out":  a ban for 24 hours of a single user from a single thread. (another name for it could be "Chill out, dude"), and the "rest", a 2-days forum-wide ban                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380158/#Comment_380158" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T23:25:40+00:00" title="May 29, 2012 11:25PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Fish bowls, too?

Back in the dim and distant past of the early 90s, the Glorantha Daily mailing list was only available as a one-a-day digest. That list contained lots of good content, thoughtful and reasoned. Many of the contributors maintained that the quality of the content was because the slow pace forced people to think about their posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the software changed and there was an opportunity to move to a more immediate model, there were many voices on the list that argued for keep the list digest-only. Ultimately, it went the way of most mailing lists, and posts were sent out immediately. The list became more populated, though this happened around the time of the mid-90s Gloranthan Renaissance, so it's difficult to see cause and effect. By my recollection, the immediate list protocol had more signal, but quite a bit more noise. Last time I look at the successor list (now hosted on Yahoo Groups), the posting were almost all the short, off-the-cuff comments, as opposed to the long posts of the Gloranthan Daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mourn its passing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380205/#Comment_380205" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-30T08:57:40+00:00" title="May 30, 2012  8:57AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2012 9:29AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I object to (a now missing) opinion and will micro-quote you to destroy your argument.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380232/#Comment_380232" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-30T11:27:51+00:00" title="May 30, 2012 11:27AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alrighty folks.
