In other games, the fun I'm having with my little personal wins isn't what gets rewarded by the system. Here's a little something I just thought up, that maybe someone else can develop. I may work it in as an option for some of the more freeformy minis games I'm puttering with yet again.<br/><br/>What you need:<br/>Some 3 x 5 index cards<br/>Pencil or pen<br/>Some way of tracking units of action, be they they player turns or scenes or sessions or whatever.<br/><br/>Okay, go ahead and play the game the way it's normally played. As you go along, every now and again, you'll come up with something you'd like to see come into the story, right?<br/><br/>It could be a scene, a could be an event, could be a new direction, could be a great zinger or one-liner. Whatever.<br/><br/>On one side of the card, write the idea down but don't show it to anyone. Just leave it beside you. Also include a number on the same side as what you've written. This is the amount of units of game ( sessions, player turns, scenes, whatever) before the thing expires. Basically, you're bidding against yourself on how soon you can get the thing into play.<br/><br/>You can have, oh, maybe three of these going at once. That seems like enough, right?<br/><br/>Leave the blank back side up. <br/><br/>Starting on each unit of time after the one during which you wrote your goal, put down a hatchmark on each of the cards.<br/><br/>When the goal is achieved, give yourself one point for each hatchmark on the back of the card.<br/><br/>Take double the points if you managed to wrangle things around in such a way that another player effectively sets up the goal for you without realizing it. Oooh! You social mainpulator you!<br/><br/>Remove the card, and open up a slot for a new one to be added.<br/><br/>If the hatch marks on the back of the card ever exceed the number you wrote on the front of the card, the wine has gone bad. Remove the card, face down still to the side, and now you have an open slot. You can still get a single point for that goal if it ever comes up in the future, but basically, it's just a loose end so not worth as much.<br/><br/>Whether you ever reveal your side game to other players is up to you.<br/><br/>As a variant, of course, everyone can do this little side thingie, but should reveal them either as they happen, or after the session.<br/><br/>Optional:<br/>If you and another player ( or players) both have the same or nearly the same goal, only the highest score scores the points, and then only the difference between the highest and second highest values. After all, if everyone saw it coming from a long way off and all went for it, I guess you didn't really much surprise anyone, right?<br/><br/>That's it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176851/#Comment_176851" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T06:28:57+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  6:28AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like fun!<br/><br/>Especially as a way to make things more interesting for yourself.<br/><br/>For a competitive game, you might need some limitation on the "expiration" count--otherwise, why not set it as high as possible all the time?<br/><br/>That number could also count as a tiebreaker for two players having the same goal: the lower number wins, since it was the more "risky" bet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176949/#Comment_176949" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T21:29:09+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  9:29PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way I look at it is that it is good for "bragging rights" or multiple player "wins". Hopefully, it could also encourage out of game feedback, as I'd hope people would share their goal cards in a debrief or even at the game itself.<br/><br/>I find that sometimes trying to get feedback can be really hard, especially when everyone tries to say at least something nice.<br/>The time limit is a really good idea Paul! Thanks!<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and to clarify, I'd hope folks would use "goals" not just as something their own character/faction/whatever achieved, but also as things they'd like to see happen in a game.<br/><br/>For example, I played a minis game with Elliot W. a few weeks back, that involved a Lost World type setting ( Space 1889 Venus, actually). If I was to write a goal card down, it could just as easily be "A herd of plant eaters chased by the T-Rex stampedes into the party" 3.<br/><br/>Now clearly, that's pretty likely to happen, and someone else playing might write that as well, but it gets it into play and acts as feedback to see if you're on the same page, even though you aren't directly sayng it.<br/><br/>OTOH, you could have something pretty clever that might be harder to work in. "A wounded dino is nearby and threatening. If the players manage to calm it and help it, it will show back up in a later scene and aid them unexpectedly" 5.<br/><br/>Or "One of the other characters convinces the Big Game Hunter not to back such a precious and rare creature!" 6.<br/><br/>Those, too could be interesting tests to see how close you are to other folks in thinking.<br/><br/>Heck, you could even put in things that are bad for the main characters, just becaause you think they'd be cool.<br/><br/>Obviously, this is easier in games where you can control some elements of stuff outside of your personal character, although maybe GMs could try this stuff, too, and score their own personal points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
