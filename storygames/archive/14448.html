Don't just react to the subject.<br/><br/><br/>Someone I respect, but will remain anonymous (I won't name names, please don't ask), recently wrote, <b>"SG has a pretty good history of silencing people of color or women."</b><br/><br/><br/>I've always taken Story Games as a place that's friendly towards people of color and women. But I'm not a woman or a person of color (by American standards). Given my perspective and biases, I'm probably not seeing something. Help me understand.<br/><br/>Story Games sometimes has a reputation for being anti-traditional games, pro-liberal, and a little passive aggressive (thread derailments, nitpicking, dueling thread topics). That said, Story Games has over 3,000 members\u2026 but it unfortunately only takes the action of a small number of people to paint a reputation for an entire community. Recently a person who is relatively new to Story Games with a small number posts made an anti-traditional game comment that was in my opinion, unfairly taken as representative of the community at large. But you can't control how people perceive you. And sometimes there is a seed of truth driving those opinions. Or sometimes it is completely true but we are too close to see it. I want to know if there is truth to Story Games being a place that has silenced people of color or women. <br/><br/><br/>Before replying to this post, please <b>READ THE FOLLOWING RULES.</b> <span style="color: #FF0000;">Failure to follow these rules when posting may lead to your post being edited or deleted. Let me stress... we don't want to have to edit or delete anyone's post... so please follow these 6 simple rules.</span> <br/><br/><b>1. If you do feel that Story Games has a pretty good history of silencing people of color or women</b>, please let us know. Either post here or if you want to remain anonymous, whisper me or email me at jenskot @ gmail DOT com so I can post your thoughts for you while keeping your identity and specific names hidden.<br/><br/>Feel free to post as little or as much as you want. It's cool to just say, "I've seen Story Games silence people of color or women" or "I've felt silenced here." Feel free to explain why you feel this way and include links to specific threads if you want. Whatever you're comfortable with. <br/><br/><b>2. If you're not sure but suspect that Story Games might have a history of silencing people of color or women</b>, see <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> above.<br/><br/><b>3. Don't respond to other people's posts.</b> Consider this more a poll than a discussion thread. If you want to say something that may not be appropriate in this thread, please send a whisper or start a new thread.<br/><br/><b>4. If you DO NOT feel that Story Games silences people of color or women</b>, that's totally cool but please don't post to this thread. This is mainly a poll of people who DO feel Story Games silences people of color or women.<br/><br/><b>5. Stay on topic</b>. <br/><br/><b>6. If you have questions about this thread or comments about the rules</b>, whisper me. <br/><br/><br/>I realize that asking Story Games about Story Games is problematic. But at the moment, it's all I have.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328495/#Comment_328495" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T12:12:00+00:00" title="June  8, 2011 12:12PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen lots of things silenced, marginalized, misrepresented, or discounted here, to one degree or another. Communities do that, inevitably, or they wouldn't be communities with a definable identity. Since this - like most internet fora, and most RPG fora in particular - is a very, very white privileged male environment, yeah, those who don't fit that description come in for more of it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, compared to just about any other place on the internet for discussing roleplaying, this is about the LEAST exclusionary I have ever encountered. Even compared to some that expressly try to be inclusive. All too often, the overt attempt to create safe space succeeds only at the cost of diversity (which is very much NOT to say that it isn't a good thing to do).<br/><br/>SG seems to do very well at including a broad spectrum of people and experiences most of the time.

And I've seen it not just about women and cultural groups, but also people with disabilities as well. Sometimes, I just want to stop people and tell them to go back to the "Rules and Purpose of Story Games" sticky at the very top of the threads, and point out this:\n<blockquote><br/><b>The rules for joining:</b><br/>* Strive to treat other participants with respect.<br/>* Strive to talk constructively, even on fun and fluff.<br/>* Criticism and Discussion of ideas is kosher. <br/>* If you are bitter about something, do not express that bitterness here. Find another venue for bitterness.<br/></blockquote>\nI've tried to live by these rules, even before seeing them printed on SG. Sometimes I will stray, but I keep trying to keep myself in check. I don't know why some people ignore it and want to be disruptive instead. I WANT there to be more constructive discussion on women and gaming. I WANT there to be more innovations with gaming involving other cultures and cultural viewpoints.

Not in a "your opinion is not welcome here" sort of way, but in a "badger and argue until they give up" sort of way.<br/><br/>I've seen it mainly in topics that are sensitive and related to the shut-down person's experience of oppression, marginalization, etc. Like a person of color in a thread on racial stereotypes, or a woman in a thread on sexist art, for instance. It may happen in other, less charged topics as well, I don't know, but the above topics are where it stands out.<br/><br/>It stands out even when I disagree with particular opinions of the shut-down person. It stands out because the person doesn't seem to be heard, thus their voice is marginalized, thus it doesn't matter if they're "right" or not*, because that person's perspective, good or ill, is absent when the person removes themselves from the forum environment.<br/><br/>I sometimes feel resentful that a person, however justified, has chosen to remove themselves from S-G discussion. I want their voice to be here, and I want them to be OK with Story-Games and willing to engage. <b>EDIT: This about my feelings, not their actions. The person in question has done nothing "wrong"* and doesn't owe me anything. The person in question is most likely doing the healthiest thing they can for themselves in that circumstance. And I mainly am resentful and frustrated with the people who drove them away.

I am not here so you can feel good about yourself, and that goes double when the community is making me feel like shit. Don't resent the people who leave: resent the assholes who make staying here an exercise in useless frustration. I repeat: you are resenting the wrong people.<br/><br/>If your house is a disgusting landfill that smells like cat piss, you can resent me and be frustrated by the fact that I don't want to hang out there, but your only actual recourse is to fucking clean house.<br/><br/>The same is true of any social space.

Particularly an ephemeral one like a web forum. It really only takes a few bad actors - or bad moves by generally good ones, for that matter - to do damage and create an unwelcoming atmosphere.<br/><br/>I have never. I mean never, in 18 years on the internet. Seen any open forum that could truly be considered broadly and universally welcoming. I'm not sure such a thing is possible. Communities exist because of shared norms. Norms exclude. Inclusion destroys norms.<br/><br/>I don't expect something like SG to be a safe and welcoming environment. I am happy when it is, and I try to contribute to the good stuff and step away from the bad stuff, but it's not my place to decide what the norms are here. Only Andy can do that, really. The rest of us can talk all we like, but it's LISTENING that's really key, and as long as even a few of us don't want to do that, it's not going to work very well.<br/><br/>I feel sad when we lose voices here at SG, and I feel sad that MY voice has grown quieter over time as well, as the "center of gravity" of the site has shifted away from my interests and concerns, but it was never the mission of this place to be all things to everyone.

And I've got to say, there was definitely a moment where I said to myself, "Are these the kind of people that hang around here? Do I even want to associate with them?" I worked past it (obviously, since I'm posting right now), and the discussion had nothing to do with my ethnicity (I'm Asian) but I guarantee you if someone called me out on my race in a thread and there was no action taken on the part of the mods it would take me all of a second and a half to say "fuck all y'all" and leave without looking back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328688/#Comment_328688" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T21:44:52+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  9:44PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen people on Story Games silence people of color or women, and I've felt silenced here, and I've gotten too annoyed and frustrated too many times to enjoy the discussion here.<br/><br/>I don't post much here anymore. I don't post about race and gender and how it collides with gaming much on the internet in general anymore. I'm not interested in teaching people about what some  aspect of gaming feels like as a woman and a person of color, and maybe some people find that ironic, but there you go. I would hate for anyone to consider my views on things to be the Views of All Women of Color, and I've seen that happen all too often on and offline. <br/><br/>I don't want to justify ad nauseum my experiences as a woman of  color in roleplaying games, and I've felt that way here. So I don't post about that stuff anymore. Anywhere.<br/><br/>I do like to read the threads, though, especially the  ones that have nothing to do with race or gender. I just don't respond, and I enjoy Story Games much more that way. I do like to hear about the hot controversial threads from people I see in person, and then I don't get tempted to post. Because I do get tempted to post, but I've been burned enough that posting leads to anxiety even when there is no silencing.<br/><br/>I wish this place  were more moderated, and gently so. I don't really trust people to suppress their inner assholes on the internet, and I think you get a better quality discussion when there's someone out there to nudge  common sense and civility back into a discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328693/#Comment_328693" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T22:39:49+00:00" title="June  8, 2011 10:39PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2011 10:42PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't consider this a safe forum to discuss politics, including race and gender.<br/>A couple of bad experiences with folks who can be difficult have made it clear it's easier to just take the discussion elsewhere.<br/>Christ, and I do NOT try to talk about rape/sexual violence here.

Part of that is because when I was more of a regular, I didn't know what to look for. Part of it is because I habitually check out of threads when they turn toward strong statements of opinion.  That said, when other people write that they have witnessed or been the subject of such incidents, I do not doubt them.

It would undermine the safety of this thread if women and people of color were exempt from the rules.

As specified in the post above, no posts are being deleted. Additionally, the women who have specifically had their posts moderated do not feel that moderation in this thread is a negative thing:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth </cite>John actually encouraged me to edit this post to not be a reply and re-post it, but I haven't had time due to a busy first week at work.

Posters often express shock at others who disagree with the most popular local opinions, or alternatively simply ignore the posts where outlying opinions appear.</p>\n<p>There are some exceptions to this pattern. Ben Lehman, for instance, gets away with non-groupthink pretty regularly. I don't think it's a coincidence that Ben's a white dude.</p>\n<p>You can see positive effects of the groupthink as well, so don't think that I'm entirely condemning it: while I personally found the frenzied outpouring of hurriedly-composed Oracles for IAWA variants tedious, I'm sure that they were useful for many people, and the Names Project would have never happened if it weren't for groupthink.</p>\n<p>But it's got its dark side, and I think the dark side comes mostly from our failing to think about where other posters are coming from. Our backgrounds shape our thoughts, tastes, and opinions deeply, and it's not always <em>obvious</em> that you think differently than I because you're enculturated as a white woman and I'm a brown man and that other guy's a white man, but that's one clear element that divides us, and <em>because</em> this is a forum where the vast majority of posters are white men, it is they who will most often find their thoughts and opinions supported by others with similar backgrounds.</p>\n<p>But if you stop and think about your fellow posters, you might understand them better and maybe not interact with them so clumsily. As subalterns, we (and by this I mean: poor people, old people, young people, people of color, women, GLBT people, (for this forum also trad gamers, fantasy gamers, hardcore scifi gamers) probably others I haven't thought of) deal with you guys and have to understand you all the time to survive, but you've got no such survival pressure, so if you want to make this a friendly place, there's no easy answer*. It takes work.</p>\n<p>*: And for this reason I don't expect this place to change. It's a place on the Internet, after all, and no one here who needs to change his/her behavior is actually suffering anything other than mild inconvenience due to the status quo. You could just go to a more open and diverse place like RPG.net. There's no profit in it for you!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329063/#Comment_329063" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T20:15:08+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  8:15PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a white male I haven't felt any silencing based on that, I don't think I've advertised it either, but it's a safe assumption that most people on an RPG forum would be white males. I do remember one discussion on a feminist topic in which I said something relating to it and got a brief negative reaction. It wouldn't entirely surprise me if there were such a history, but I'd wonder if it might be misconstrued - I've commented a couple times that S-G seems a bit insular, and someone used to being excluded due to gender or race might perceive a more general exclusion as based on that. Could also be based on the fact that there is already a circle, there's a good chance that it's mostly white males posting on S-G, and that if you're not white or not a male you might not as easily fit in with the "in crowd".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329139/#Comment_329139" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T10:08:31+00:00" title="June 11, 2011 10:08AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2011 10:10AM by jenskot.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi all,<br/><br/>Below are quotes from people who've whispered and emailed me. <b>PLEASE NOTE: </b> this is not the end of the thread!

It's something that causes me to step out of threads, because watching white men muse about the plight of non-whites &amp; non-men as though they are champions for them is a lot of bull. [snip] So, if you're a white dude, it doesn't look like it silences anyone because there's talk about it. But if you're not, it's a bunch of white dudes "speaking for you." </blockquote>\n<blockquote>There have been occasions when I have felt that vague resentful posts on SG were actually aimed at some of the women designers here. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>My experience is, I'm a brown person [snip] I can say for sure that we both have felt silenced, most often by people [snip] don't even realize they're doing it.- Often it's a case of someone being like, "Well, you don't toe the party line but you must be a random outlier," rather than thinking that their party line might rest on premises that are objectionable to PoC or women. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>[snip] I have no specific incidents to point to, because I honestly don't track user names/personal details closely enough to have noticed any specific incidents. That probably makes me part of the problem: the net result of me not caring enough to look at the name above the post and think about who that person might be means I'm reading their words in my internal generic-white-guy voice instead of in whatever gender/culture voice they were meant for. If the post itself doesn't refer directly to the author's sex or ethnicity, odds are I won't even know I'm doing it; and that's a shitty thing to do, and I feel bad about it (even though I also don't know whether anyone notices or cares when I do it). </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Sometimes I feel like this although overall this SG is waaay more welcoming than most places. Have you read Youtube comments? </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Yes, I feel like this. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>I've felt it but I'm not sure if it is specific to being a women or a minority. I think it has to do with general bullying and aggressiveness. Maybe it is a forum thing. Most women I know just go to Facebook. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>I'm worried that this thread may cause too much light to be shed on the negative aspects of gender and race on here. For all the negative that's considered to be societally normative and I think people don't even realize they're doing, I see so much positive on here and encouraging people to learn and accept different POV's. I hope you're following up with a "women and minorities, do you feel you've had a positive experience here" thread, because I have been helped and supported so much on here it's ridiculous. If you want change, it's good to focus on the positive and the educational aspects of these difficult topics. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>It's subtle. It has to be. Anyone being overtly sexist or racist gets jumped on. So it's moved to covert sexism and racism. For example, women get questioned more than men. Men start arguments with men, ignoring points made by women (probably because they're not made in that argumentative style). </blockquote>\n<blockquote>A large part of the issue is that people who participate on Story Games see themselves as being more inclusive, more worldly, more accepting of other viewpoints than the mouth breathers who play D&amp;D. But the people here aren't that different than the people at RPGnet or elsewhere. The significant difference is that this color and gender-blindness is such a large part of Story Games' self-identity that when the blindness is questioned, people are genuinely furious at the implication: inclusiveness is the story gamer's opposable thumb, the thing that makes him a higher being than the animals elsewhere. Or so they tell themselves. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Maybe it's a fallback from the Forge or just how forums are. There is this aggressive style of communication -- this idea of survival of the fittest in normal discussions -- where bullying is seen as acceptable and if you end up being silenced, it's because you chose to be, which means I guess, you deserve to be? Basically this attitude that whatever it takes to win an argument, no matter who gets hurt is ok as long as you win. I don't think that is specifically an anti-women thing -- most people don't know who is female -- although it's a masculine way of debating. SGames is not as bad as the Forge. I like it here. I don't know what to do about it and in general, don't worry about it. If it sucks, I will just leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It's most noticeable in threads about feminism, which are invariably dominated by white men. And, when that happens, you've got to step back and say: something's gone wrong there. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>As a white man, I've seen women and people of color effectively silenced here, and probably even participated in such. I think this has something to do with the "Hey, 'sall cool, right?" approach to moderation. Except, there are some things that really aren't cool. [snip]<br/><br/>I think there's something about the culture of nerdy white "liberal" guys which creates a nasty blind spot about race and gender privilege. It's as though we hear the sermon about these things, and decide something like, "Oh, you can't possibly be talking about ME. You must be talking about those nasty jock mouthbreather Fox News watching guys over there. Hey yeah, I think those guys suck too!" </blockquote>\n<blockquote>People post pictures with their girlfriends and you see comments like "does that game come with that girl" or "does that convention come with lots of women" and it just feels like this is a boy space. </blockquote>\n<blockquote> I don't have a problem overall but it seems like my posts may get more nitpicked than male posts. I'll post, "I think this game rule is weird" and get lots of people questioning me. A guy in a different thread will make a similar statement and people leave them be. Maybe it's not silencing. Maybe it's extra attention? And that can be both bad and good? It does seem people ask me to provide more evidence for my opinions than they are willing to give themselves or ask from other people. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>For all I know, I am probably guilty of "silencing people of color or women" on this forum. I am also probably guilty of silencing white men.<br/><br/>But here is the thing: I do not pay attention to (and usually don't even know) the race or gender of the person to whom I am responding.<br/><br/>In order to stop "silencing people of color or women", I need to start paying attention to gender and race and then explicitly treat people of color or women differently than I treat white males. I can do so, if that is the way it is supposed to work. Seems sexist and racist to me, but I can do it. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>It happens everywhere; SG isn't immune although I like the people here. It's not bad but it's easier to filter this stuff on my blog or facebook</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It happens but is it because people are female or non-white or because people just act like jerks to everyone and that happens to bully and push away a lot more females and non-whites (including, maybe less, but still including white males?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>On SG I've seen women and people of color overwhelmed with hostile response and more or less driven to silence. I've seen the same thing happen to openly homosexual people and openly transgender people. I've seen the same thing happen to people expressing an opinion that happens to not be popular on that particular day. I've seen the silencing with varying frequency and in multiple forms.<br/><br/>Short of silencing the silencers, with strict and timely moderation, Story Games will never be a "safe" place. I do not envy the person that would have that moderating responsibility. Not at all. I also agree with Helen Keller that security is a superstition, an outright lie most of the time, and that firm moderation will come with its own marginalizations and other pitfalls. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>I've felt intimidated to speak about my opinions of games, personal politics, or even how i perceive interaction between people should be. I've been trying to post more, without being frightened, and it's had mixed results.<br/><br/>In short, i'm afraid to speak openly on these forums, i'm afraid to contribute. I also agree that it's safer here by far than the rest of the internet. But it's not strictly 'safe.' And moreover, i'm not entirely certain why i get that feeling. I just know i feel like talking outloud could certainly garner judgment, or exclusion. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>I noticed this frustrating prelude, too, especially in the case of some women. They would be given this weird, kind of offputting (to me, at least) worshipful treatment by some (not all!) which created this toxic backlash from people who felt more righteous for taking the woman down a peg because she was being 'falsely' idealized. Fuck, what is up with that? I have seen it happen with some men who have some reputation in the design community, but never so acridly as it has happened with women. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329279/#Comment_329279" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T18:15:39+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  6:15PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2011 6:16PM by jenskot.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More email quotes:\n<blockquote>[snip] I'm a woman and sort of a person of color I estimate.

This forum does not stop it but it isn't causing it. <br/> <br/>Most silence others and don't even know it happens. Message Boards share the blame. I am on facebook more than here cause I can filter and block and sort and focus on my relationships and communicate in ways message boards suck at.
