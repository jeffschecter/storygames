It is available for download here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.daimongames.com/biomet/biometinfection.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.daimongames.com/biomet/biometinfection.html</a><br/><br/>What is the game about? here's the intro directly from the webpage\n<blockquote>A known scientist  is  found dead;  his body  is  revealed  to be the one of a mutant,  and the  agent  in charge of the case is mysteriously killed.<br/>An  unknown  virus  called  BioMet  is  spreading  into cybernetic  implants  like  a  cancer.  The  sprawl  is  in turmoil,  divided  between  criminals,  cyberpunks  and mutant rebels.<br/>Multiple reports indicate the appearance of the so-called MetZ, once humans, now infected cyborgs possessed by the daemon of cybernetics. <br/>Four special agents are called to investigate.<br/></blockquote>\nAll comments are welcome - and if you spot a typo or anything unclear or not explained properly, please let me know! thanks!!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
