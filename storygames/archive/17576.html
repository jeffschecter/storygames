My name's Michael, and I'm a minutes-away-from-graduating design student at a university down in Australia. Long story short: I'm looking to beef up my portfolio a bit, and I suspect there's some people 'round here who wouldn't mind getting a designer to give their stuff a bit of polish.<br/><br/>Before we get to the credential-y stuff, here's a quick<br/><br/><b>WHY YOU DON'T WANT ME</b><br/>-because you want an illustrator. I'm not a particularly skilled artist in the drawing sense, my talents lie more towards layout and logos and stuff. If you're looking for someone to draw you some pictures, I'm not your man.<br/>-because you need the work done right this second. Look, I'm not saying I'm going to take six months to work on a single-page layout for you. But I've got some stuff in my near future - including hunting for a new job - that means that stuff I'm doing for free won't necessarily be my top-of-the-line, 8-hours-a-day priority. If you need to get your work out quick, maybe look for someone else.<br/>-because you're doing a big-budget, limited edition, thousands-of-dollars runaway Kickstarter release. I'd love to work on one of those - budgets are fun when you've actually got money in them - but I can't promise you that my work is going to be as good as someone who's been working for a decade, and if you're going to make some money you should put some of that towards paying a pro.<br/><br/>But. Let's say none of those apply.<br/><br/>Howdy again. I'm Michael. I'm relatively new (the last 6 months or so) to the whole RPG thing - I threw some money towards Our Last Best Hope and I've been caught ever since. (My current collection is OLBH, Fiasco, InSpectres, Dresden, and Leverage, but I've had a chance to play very few of them.) I've put together some character sheets and cards for OLBH that are up for download <a href="http://www.magpiegames.com/our-last-best-hope/olbh-downloads/" rel="nofollow">here</a>; I've also written a Mission (superheroes!) that's going to be in the companion book once that comes out.<br/><br/>Outside of the RPG world, my portfolio is at my website, <a href="http://michaelbusuttil.com/" rel="nofollow">michaelbusuttil.com</a>; feel free to check it out and let me know what you think. I wouldn't mind a credit and a copy of whatever we end up working on, but other than that I'm not looking for payment - like I said, for me this is about adding some work to my 'folio. Hit me up here or at hello@michaelbusuttil.com if you're interested. Apologies if this is too blatantly self-promo-y.<br/><br/>Alternately, if you've just got a question, want me to have a quick look at something and give an opinion, go ahead and post it here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stlhood" title="stlhood"><img alt="stlhood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/288/nVP24WH8OIYEI.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stlhood">stlhood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398552/#Comment_398552" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T22:10:00+00:00" title="November 23, 2012 10:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your work is nice, congrats on your impending graduation!<br/><br/>Do you ever do layout or typographic work for the web?
