It is a modern, contemporary game, set to the place you (the players) live. The players constitute the Morning-family; father and spouse at 50 in start of game, and children at 19-29. The game aims to investigate the fate of the family, from the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the father, and to his death by cancer 10-30 years later.<br/><br/>The game provide the players with pre-generated characters, and make use of the players first name as the first name of the character (to make it simple remembering and using the names, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to make them "play themselves" in the game). The characters got a handful of traits like; self-contempt, hard-working, poetic, sporty, etc. The traits are not set in a mechanical system, but used as inspirational elements in a method largely based on player intuition and interactive dialogue.<br/><br/>The game is played out with players alternating in setting scenes, by stating the season, the place, and which of the characters are present (you may set scenes with 2 to all characters present). The player setting the scene also is the one who may end it. The first scene is set by the game, with all characters present, and so is the last scene (the player of Mr. Morning got power to end these scenes). Each scene consist largely of a dialogue (with some descriptive comments), wherein the characters and their relationships are developed.<br/><br/>The players are quite free to steer the game as they see fit, within the framework of the method and the characters at hand. So this is largely a game building on the scenes feeding into new scenes, strengthening the relationships as play moves along, and making it all vibrate with more and more acuity. And all of it steered by the intuition of the players.\n<blockquote><b>Sample scene:</b><br/><br/>Characters:<br/>- Bent Erik (31, black-clad and rebellious rock-poet)<br/>- Erlend (57, conventional family-man, and gay, stepfather of Bent Erik)<br/><br/>Scene set by player Erlend:<br/>Erlend and Bent Erik in the living room, late autumn-night, in front of the telly.<br/><br/>Erlend: That was quite a film, eh?<br/>Bent Erik: Oh, well ... jaa ...<br/>Erlend (enthusiastic, clearly trying to bond with BE): So, what do you say about it? Makes Hollywood seem a bit bleak, eh?<br/>Bent Erik: Maybe ...<br/>Erlend (still lively): It's like; we have seen so many of these films now, and they really blows you mind! Makes you see film in a totally different way, eh?<br/>Bent Erik (beginning to tire): Ja, it's been interesting.<br/>Erlend: So, what do you say; ready for some more? Tonight? Got an English comedy-show for us to delve into ...<br/>Bent Erik: English comedy?<br/>Erlend: Ja, "All about Anderson". Great series! From the sixties.<br/>Bent Erik (totally resigned now): Well, ok, we may see it ...<br/>Erlend (smiling enthusiastically): Great!<br/>(cuts through air with his hands, indicating the scene is over)</blockquote>\nWe had first play-test yesterday. The game ended in tragedy, as Mr. Morning rejected his son trying to reach out to him (after years of quite open contempt), and then went down a spiral of self-loathing which ended in his bloody suicide (in the bathroom, cutting his wrists, found by his family while still alive, dying in their hands).<br/><br/>The game mostly did what I wanted it to do; to give the players a framework for creating their own version of the Morning-family fate, and for them to experience "the magic of being another ordinary human being".<br/><br/>I look forward to the new play-test this wednesday, with me as observer, and the planned blind-testing of it in the US (don't know the city) and in Alta (Norway).<br/><br/>Any comments on the game-theme are welcome!<br/>- How do you feel about playing out contemporary human drama?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289767/#Comment_289767" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T07:25:03+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  7:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contemporary human drama:  honestly, it depends on what type it is.

Related experiences from real life will help us keep the interaction realistic, and this effect may be utilized by the game-smith. You do not have to, as a game-smith, feed the players so much of the fiction-world-basics in such games. So they do differ fro the more fantastic or strange genres. :-)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ina</cite>Your game aims at creating the effect that is somewhat similar to the uneasy feeling that gives the game named "The Father" by Erlend Bruer, doesn't it?</blockquote>LoL! Erlend was one of the play-testers yesterday (the one "Erlend" in my sample of play above), but I have never played his game "The Father" (at least; not to my recollection). I do not know if the games correlates in aiming at an uneasy feeling. My game is not singularly aimed at this, but uneasiness is a very obvious possibility with the elements given.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ina</cite>And if I may I'd like to ask you to tell me more about your game.</blockquote>Of course you may! I'm happy to answer questions about my brainchildren!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ina</cite>I see that the person to end the scene is the one that has also started it. But is there any particular condition for the scene to end?</blockquote>No. The player decides.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ina</cite>Is there a specific aim for the scene? Like \u2013 to reveal a new fact form the past, to strengthen or loosen the bonds between characters, to bring the situation to the point when something significant happens?</blockquote>The game gives you no advice on aiming any particular scene at anything. It gives you general advice about playing with a calm mindset, being positive and always emulate and extrapolate on the elements given by other players, even when these are details about your own character. And the games advice you to keep most of the scenes about everyday life, nothing spectacular. The details of the particular scenes are left to the players.<br><br/>One thing which came up during evaluation yesternight, was the option of advising players to intersperse the gameplay with some kind of "aimless scenes" (scenes with no correlation to the many plots that evolves during play), to vary the rhythm and give the players some respite from the intensity of the drama.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ina</cite>I'm asking about these, because setting the goal of the scene really helps me to understand, what the pace of the play should be and what kind of story are we going to create.</blockquote>I believe that by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> helping you understand goals and story-arc, I will increase my chance of helping you delve into your character. I do this by writing gametext aimed at helping you focus on the feelings and conditions of your character, and aim at helping you, the player, to accept the unpredictability of fate. My aim is to have you come out the other side, with a kind of drama impossible to predict and difficult to understand, but totally recognizable and intensely satisfying.<br/><br/>I prefer such a mode of play. Catering to and relying on <i>the intuition of the players</i> is all about this.<br/><br/>I aim for simplistic design, to support complex drama.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289890/#Comment_289890" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T11:13:07+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 11:13AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How does your system actually work.

I'm afraid my answer is; you need to read the game, and most likely try it out, to get it. You get a character (there is a lot of help for you in that character), and you play it (the method of the game helps you too), but even so it differs a bit from the mechanical way of doing role-playing games.<br/><br/>There are no <i>mechanics</i>, but there is a very simple and stringent <i>method</i> (and I hope to make that method even better by this batch of play-testing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290167/#Comment_290167" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T19:26:22+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  7:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From what I've seen, play is structured by the characters (pre-written but open to interpretation) and rules for framing of scenes.

It is waaay over midnight, and I've earned my sleep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/erlend" title="erlend"><img alt="erlend" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/erlend">erlend</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291323/#Comment_291323" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T05:34:45+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  5:34AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played this game on the first play-test on Sunday, and really had a great experience. Fun to read that it's being compared to "The Father", and I did make that comparison myself while we were playing. Both games centre on one male person and his problems. I think "Mr. Morning" is a lot more open, though, and a lot more like real life. In the Father, the father is never present in the scenes - the characters only talk about him. Mr Morning has all characters potentially present, it is also a bit longer, playtime-wise and has much longer character descriptions. <br/><br/>Judging the game by the standard scale for "realistic social drama centering on male authority person", I give "A poem for Mr. Morning" four out of five phalluses. (Or is that phalli?)<br/><br/>Looking forward to read your report about yesterday's game, Tomas!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_291326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291326/#Comment_291326" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T06:25:49+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  6:25AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: erlend</cite>I give "A poem for Mr. Morning" four out of five phalluses.</blockquote>Oh boy!

Mother not speaking to him.<br/>- 17th scene: father dying by cancer, family gathered around him, he weak and resigned; no more to live for, dies<br/><br/><b>Two of the players</b> did not get it; they ended up with much less emotional intensity and immersion than I aim for. Still both of them were part of some beautiful scenes and the source of some nice characterization (from my viewpoint, and from the viewpoint of other players). They fell victim to the intuitive method of the game, which was not communicated in the best of ways. These two players had intensity-arcs going the wrong way of the intended.\n<blockquote><i><b>Side-note:</b> One of these players played my game "Lykke" (Happiness) last winter, and said this game had serious flaws in comparison to that game. I know that this game is more open, more dependent on the intuition of the players working in unison to create the drive of the drama. "Lykke" is equipped with a small mechanic to create the drive, so you get a lot more for free in that game. But this game is meant to be simpler in method, putting more responsibility on the players. So I will have to make this game the best it can be, without comparing it to other games.</i></blockquote>\n<b>Three players</b> had a stronger experience, though even them a bit short on both emotional intensity and immersion. They had intensity gradually climbing towards the end, as intended, but I would like to see an even deeper engagement in the game. One of these players was totally new to verbal role-playing games (had some larp-experience).<br/><br/><b>Notes:</b><br/>- The game relies heavily on the players cooperating to frame scene, fill them, and finding the balance in their co-play, between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">invites</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">challenges</span>. I have not addressed this point properly in the game-text. Will do!<br/><br/>- Needs to underline the strong focus on PCs in the game. No NPCs are actually needed. Some statists will do nicely in some scenes, but only as narrated figures in the environment, not as active elements.<br/><br/>- Needs to clarify that only two verbal modes are meant to be used in the game; dialogue in-character, 3rd person narrative for actions.<br/><br/>- Underline the need to be short when setting a scene; no story-telling; only effective scene-framing! Go straight for interactive dialogue!<br/><br/>Very useful game-session! Had lots of useful feedback from the players (a questionnaire and a discussion). Know more about what this game is intended to do now, and that makes me eager to write a new version (but I will wait for the report from US-play-testing ...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_301777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301777/#Comment_301777" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-22T15:23:35+00:00" title="November 22, 2010  3:23PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Third play-test;<br/><br/><br/>- five players (3 men and 2 women)<br/>- me participating<br/>- 11 scenes all in all (including preset opening and end-scene)<br/><br/>This game started off quite nice, with tensions from the start, and then it heated up ...<br/><br/><b>The scenes:</b><br/>- 2nd scene: Mr. Morning and his wife eating breakfast, very mellow and low-key<br/>- 3rd scene: 3 siblings driving go-cart, letting tensions show through roaring action on the field<br/>- 4th scene: Grandma dying, Robert the "black" talking to her, and father bailing out of the scene (tired). quarrel amongst the rest<br/>- 5th scene: Alejandra Morning talking with friend on the phone, about her "need to go away", Mr. Morning calling about his trousers<br/>- 6th scene: At the airport; Alejandra moving to Texas, tense farewell with husband, and "kind" son<br/>- 7th scene: Thanks-giving; "kind" son reading a poem, father destroying it by being drunk and miserable<br/>- 8th scene: Hike in the woods, but father bailing out, and being forced into a near breakdown (gets his pills, and flees, in the end)<br/>- 9th scene: Father and "black" son on the Detox-centre, father about to get released, calm, Robert talking about anger; father answering calmly<br/>- 10th scene: The daughter inviting her two brothers to help her in her new apartment, and them ending up in a fruitless quarrell<br/>- 11th scene: Alejandra Morning's 60th anniversary, in Texas, with a bunch of her new friends, great speaches from father and "kind" son, and then father falls over on the beach, and dies.<br/><b>-   THE END   -</b><br/><br/>Strong experience for all!<br/>Clearly different character-stories:<br/>- Mom Alejandra getting a beautiful story about newfound freedom when escaping the family<br/>- Father Tomas going down as a bitter drunkard, and then raising from the ashes<br/>- Black son Robert being dark and cynical, but clear-sighted, and successful as a poet<br/>- Kind son David trying to mediate the chaotic family, while being stunted in ambitions, but redefining himself and finding happiness<br/>- Eldest sibling Veslem\xf8y working hard, trying to create more than her father and mother, and ending up loosing everything in her cramped materialism<br/><br/><b>Notes:</b><br/>- The game needs a looser intro.

Thanks!<br/><br/>- Must clarify the "poem-mechanic" of the game, so it is more of an option for the players (especially the kind and black sibling, who are both "poetic")<br/><br/><b>Very strong and nice game-session! A narrative triumph! </b> Touched us allk in lot of ways, with depth and beauty. Especially the small communications, un-said and half-said (which are hard to write into the scene-list), that filled the space between the characters, and fed into their future, were wonderfully rich this time. <br/><br/>Had lots of useful feedback from the players (a good discussion, and answers to some pointed questions). Know more about how this game will become stronger now! I will do some changes to it in the coming weeks, and put it out there for blind-testing.<br/><br/><b>IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME <br/>TEST THIS GAME, <br/>PLEASE SAY SO HERE!</b><br/>I will send you the game-file, for you to peruse and play, and hope to get a report back. It is a very easy read.<br/><br/>The game is suited for 4-6 players, grown ups, and is a game of an ordinary family in a contemporary setting. it starts with Mr. Morning celebrating his 50th anniversary, and ends with him dying in the last scene of the game. So you play the last 10-20 years of his life. The "magic" of the game is found in the richness of characters and relationships you are able to build, through the easy interaction of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301866/#Comment_301866" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T08:34:04+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  8:34AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can promise to try and get my Thursday night group to play it!
