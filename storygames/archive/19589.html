How would that work?</i><br/><br/>It's very simple. Each player chooses 2-4 items from a list of everyday household objects- umbrella, photo frame, bicycle, empty champagne bottle, computer monitor etc.- and assigns a valency to each one (+/-/++/--/+/-). Then the player group imagines how the objects might have been important to the game's protagonist. They then frame and act out scenes involving the objects, adding NPCs (lovers, colleagues and friends etc.) along the way- in order to try to find out what kind of person the character was/is.<br/><br/>The game's central conceit is that you're walking down an unassuming, suburban terrace street, when you come upon a house with a skip outside containing the objects listed. You start to muse about the person who has recently moved out: what kind of person they were, what their life was like and why they've moved out etc.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much it. Short and sweet, probably runs in about a couple of hours. Wanna play? I know I do!<br/><br/>Link to current doc <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/SkipJack.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435400/#Comment_435400" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-16T10:13:37+00:00" title="July 16, 2014 10:13AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Catty?  I'd love to be involved in your playtests but setting up a local playtest can be difficult.  One weekly group has a long list of requested sessions and the other is in the middle of a long campaign.  There are surprisingly few roleplayers in Vegas.<br/><br/><b>I'd like to suggest that you run playtests in a Google Hangout.</b>  Working online and at home, I have a lot more flexible time than most of my players do.  It would be pretty easy for me to jump into a hangout for a couple hours with a little notice on almost any day of the week, and I'm guessing there are others here who feel the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435401/#Comment_435401" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-16T10:44:59+00:00" title="July 16, 2014 10:44AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2014 11:04AM by catty_big.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, I'm trying to organise that. The problem I have unfortunately is that I'm currently living with an elderly relative who doesn't know how to allow me access to her broadband so I can use my laptop there, having downloaded the Hangout app on it (said relative is also scared shitless of stuff messing with her pc so is extremely unlikely to let me download it on hers), plus I can't go to late-opening internet cafes as I don't want to come back late at night and disturb her- she's 80 yo, and not infirm or anything but, you know, she needs her beauty sleep. I'm hoping to move out sometime this century however, so watch this space...........                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
