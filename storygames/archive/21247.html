I am wondering how a post itself, the very thing that one writes resolves the conflict or task resolution. I am not even sure if there should be rules for this. <br/><br/>At first I thought, number of words, number of adjectives, or borrowing from Wushu where the more description the powerful something becomes. As a former teacher I even mused, whoever writes the best wins. But that some seems underhanded. <br/><br/>Writing, narration itself as resolution, can it work?<br/><br/>Again I started this at another place, so my apologies.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465469/#Comment_465469" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T19:18:48+00:00" title="August 10, 2017  7:18PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you familiar with <i>De Profundis</i>?

He let out a growl and a cough from his broad chest looking upon the cleave-axe beside his chair. It had been a long time since there had a trial of combat at the cave-throne and he nearly salivated in anticipation. The lesser orcs and the concubines looked on anticipating this wondrous bit of entertainment.<br/>He bid the human on, to attack\u2026 <br/><br/>So, in essence, how could this character succeed or fail solely based on what you read?<br/><br/>Uruz spat when he saw the orc king move, his companions lost in the tunnels behind. He had not anticipated finding the cave-throne alone, he had hoped for help. But alas here it was. Surely he, a chieftain and sword-son, could best that giant thing before him. After all, there had been others taller, stronger- uglier. Uruz began what he had done a hundred times. He unsheathed his sword, grunted and let the shadow of battle overtake him. <br/><br/>Does Uruz succeed? Is that to narrow to say?

The basic idea is this: every time you make a move, you get a 7-9, a partial success.<br/><br/>Characters start with 6 HP and their gear. You only have the generic Defy Danger move for all situations. The player tells what their character does and if it triggers the move, the GM describes a fundamental success with a choice or a cost based on the situation. <br/><br/>In your combat example the character would wound (if the monster has more than 1 HP) or kill the opponent since their attack is fundamentally successful, but there would be a cost. The cost might be losing 1 HP, it might be e.g. getting thrown into a river or it might be both. The GM decides based on the situation. A weak orc wouldn't both wound the character and get to throw him, but a strong ogre could do that. For simplicity's sake any time you take harm, lose 1 HP. You fall unconscious at 0 HP.<br/><br/>Resting refreshes HP back to 6, but the next grim portent tied to the overall situation happens. This makes sure the players don't just clear a room, rest and repeat.<br/><br/>I've playtested it once and it works. It's a bit more taxing for the GM compared to regular DW since you need to come up with costs and choices all the time, but that's not a problem in the play-by-post format.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465497/#Comment_465497" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-11T19:29:52+00:00" title="August 11, 2017  7:29PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote up an idea for a play-by-post/forum game sometime ago but have never been able to playtest it adequately, so it might be as rough as a badger's rough bits, but it's on my blog under <a href="http://groundhoggth.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/chapterhouse.html" rel="nofollow">Chapterhouse</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valdus" title="Valdus"><img alt="Valdus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/383/nKKAUZ7UNWKGK.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valdus">Valdus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465514/#Comment_465514" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-11T23:45:17+00:00" title="August 11, 2017 11:45PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2017 12:22AM by Valdus.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ill playtest that with you if you're for it. <br/><br/>Though I think the max should be more toward 750- 1000 words.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468308/#Comment_468308" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-08T13:56:12+00:00" title="December  8, 2017  1:56PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing is, if you go the route of "the number of adjectives" or similar, it encourages the players to not describe the enemy at all and t wax lyrical for pages and pages about their character.

Players would have distributed authority and collaborate to create the narrative. I would also design it to support a Dramatist approach to play. I would create rules so that during the set-up characters would be put in relationships with other PCs, NPCs, and Organizations that would produce complications, drama, conflict by their different desires/goals, values, temperament, alliances, the most important thing to them, or some other type of intrinsic interest or situational placement. Perhaps a set up something akin to <b>Hillfolk</b>, but it would be designed to fit my games goals/creative agenda. I would strip it down to just the essentials and try to figure out a system to do it as elegantly as I could (ie effective yet simple). <br/><br/>During play I would have players take turns narrating scenes. Everyone would share all the characters and tell the story in turn. I would use a narrative mechanic wherein the players would vote on the direction of the narrative after pausing during a critical point in the given scene. The players would vote on whether a "good", "bad", or "mixed" result would happen to the character(s) that was the most critical to, and affected by, the story at that given point in the scene. It could also reflect what would happen to another critical thing in, or element of, the story other than the character(s), so long as it was an important moment in the story and the outcome would create dramatic weight, stakes, or something interesting in the narrative. So the director would pause the scene at a critical point in their narrative, in which the outcome for the most relevant character/event/etc. would create the most drama, narrative interest, stakes, etc.--basically, on the cusp of when the most critical element of the story within the scene presented itself. At this point, after the director paused the narrative, the players would all vote on which direction the narrative would take for the character(s)/event/etc. that was most critical at that point in the narrative, and would create the most compelling outcome, etc. Would the results be bad, good, or mixed for the character/event/etc.? The players would all type: "bad" or "good" or "mixed.' based on what they thought would produce the best story. If the vote results were a consensus, for example, if everyone voted for something "bad" to happen, then that is the direction the narrative and the rest of the scene would go and something "bad" would happen to the relevant character(s), ect. If the vote results were "mixed," then it would produce outcome that was "mixed." Again, these choices would be made based on what was best for the story, the play-style would be a Dramatist play-style. If the result was "bad," the first player that had voted for a "bad" outcome, and had an idea for the rest of the scene could type "idea;" they would then create a narrative for the rest of the scene that was bad for the character(s), etc. involved. If the result was "good" then the rest of the scene would be "good" for the character, etc. involved; again, the first player that voted for a "good" outcome, and had an idea for the rest of the scene would create the narrative for the rest of the scene. If the result was "mixed" the first player with an idea, who voted "good," would produce the "good" part of the scene and the first player with an idea, who voted "bad," would create the "bad" part of the scene. Or instead of the first player with an idea, players could just take turns creating the second part of the scene, if it made playing by post easier.

I meant that I modified my game, not your game. I haven\u2019t read your game but I skimmed it and mine is nothing like yours. So I\u2019m talking about a new game that I\u2019m designing based on some  ideas that my first response in this tread got me thinking about. I think by quoting your statement and not emphasizing that my game wasn\u2019t based on your work that I confused things, haha. I can see now that based on our past conversations and the way I wrote my comment that it was easy to read it that way.  Anyway, I meant a new game that I\u2019m working on, nothing based on your work.

For example, in the system that I'm currently working on there are 4 outcomes:\n<ul><li>Yes!</li>\n<li>Yes, but...</li>\n<li>No, but...</li>\n<li>No!</li></ul>\nI find most natural that the player gets to narrate the <b>Yes!</b> and <b>No, but...</b> outcomes and that the <i>challenger</i> (usually a GM) gets to narrate the <b>Yes, but...</b> and <b>No!</b> outcomes, because you have to be creative only half of the time and always for your own interest!<br/><br/>So you can go diceless using the same idea (<i>you can narrate a fail a continue the story as you wish or you can get a success by delegating the narration in other player</i>) and the result should be quite similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468398/#Comment_468398" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-11T17:30:50+00:00" title="December 11, 2017  5:30PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that makes sense!
