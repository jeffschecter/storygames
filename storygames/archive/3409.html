Aside from work, lack of sleep and exciting news for <a href="http://www.mouseguard.net/" rel="nofollow">MouseGuard</a> fans and me, I have also been doing a goodly amount of gaming - two to three nights a week.  Namely we (when I say we I include a number of different play groups) finished up our high fantasy DitV meets the Iron Kingdoms game, ended our PTA game based loosely on the ideas in Legends Walk,  started a new canon DitV game which I will be taking inspiration from the manga PRIEST to write the towns and running a few D&amp;D sessions using Story games techniques.<br/><br/>Anyway, I am here to talk about my SG D&amp;D sessions (as the title suggests).  This in reference to a handful of threads started by me and others to do just that.  In a brief nutshell my goal was to run a narrative based session of D&amp;D yet using the lion share of D&amp;D rules.  I still plan on trying a mini campaign but I wanted to run a few practice games first to test out some techniques.<br/><br/>Okay, so first the caveats.  If you're going to try heavy Story Game techniques with a bunch of hippie gamers then all is well.  If you're going to introduce some of these ideas into your game group and they are all completely on board and looking forward to a new style of play, then by all means try it out.<br/><br/>That being said.  I have run this twice now and both times were met with some resistance.  The story gamers involved took it all in stride and were comfortable with much of what was going on (yet they often noted that the limits of the approach were often attributed to the system itself and not the SG applications).  I have a couple of friends that do play a bunch of SG games (namely due to doing half of their gaming with me).  However, when they come to the table to play D&amp;D they plan on doing just that and doing it the way they had been doing it before being introduced to hippie games.<br/><br/>The moral of the story... the big problem with running things this way is that I find myself breaking social contract (my own personal inviolate grail) before the players even come to the table.  I mean there was no outright dysfunction as we all like each other and trust one another however there was a goodly amount of grumbling or concern afterward.  Rob Bohl was privy to the first game and I ran another with some alterations.  I will talk about techniques more later but I'd like to hear some thoughts before I do.<br/><br/>So what I am looking for is comments on your thoughts about social contract and where our responsibilities lie.  Normally I deal with social contract at the table - here is the game we're playing and here are the ground rules we all agree to.  But now I am realizing that there are assumptions folk come to the table with regarding playstyle based on prior experience.  It hadn't occured to me yet as I thought about it makes perfect sense - how do you keep up social contract at all when using a game someone else knows?  I mean, even if I say "I'm playing DitV," I cannot be certain HOW someone else played Dogs and what their experience is.  Concievably I am running into expectation issues even before we sit down to play.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76972/#Comment_76972" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T14:54:35+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  2:54PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you've hit the nail on the head by identifying this as a social contract breach.

It gives you all the elements and a central person to organize them.

If she didn't like something that's not necessarily because I promised something and didn't deliver, or because she was expecting something from me and I didn't deliver, it might just be that she's grumbling because she didn't like some much more specific thing that happened.

It could be a game where the GM sets up a relationship chart at the beginning! Or, it just might be a shoe! Who knows!<br/><br/>Seriously, the name started as kind of a joke, and it just stuck. There are some things that some of these hippie games do (set up "situation" before play, either through the GM's mouth or through player collaboration; more rules on guiding story, relationships, motivations and other non-physical stuff; scene framing, etc), some things that a very few games do (No GM, high player collaboration, etc), but we (I or whomever) hasn't bothered to draw a line, saying "X Y and Z make a game a Story Game".<br/><br/>The whole thing developed out of a hubub on RPGNet some two years ago or so. There were these great (as in "big", decidedly not as in "good") debates on various games: "My Life With Master is not a Roleplaying Game, because it has an endgame condition. Oh, it's a game alright, and a game where you Play a Role, but it's not a Real Roleplaying Game". Same with Dogs in the Vineyard, Capes, Polaris, Universalis (well, ok, on that front I agree to a point; even the creator says it's not an RPG :-) ), etc. You play a role. And it's a game. But... it's not a roleplaying game. Because of stuff like relationship rules, or endgame rules, or deciding what happened up front and then playing towards that, etc.<br/><br/>So what the fuck are these games, then?<br/><br/>Clinton, back on some blog post he made, said, "I dunno. Maybe we should call them "Story Games"?" (or maybe it was someone else ON Clinton's blog, I forget now)<br/><br/>It stuck. <br/><br/>Oh, they're not roleplaying games? Well shit, I guess we'll have to call them Story Games or someshit then. <br/><br/>Originally, I was going to use this title as the name of my gaming company (Game: Coming Soon! ...Maybe!), but later, when I decided to make a friendly small-press-centric goober fan forum, I decided to use the domain name for that instead. <br/><br/>Maybe some day people will put together a list of definitive qualities.

Issues I laid at the feet of the game and not the social contract. Don wanted to change as few rules as possible. In fact, at the time, he argued that he had changed none. I don't know if he still maintains that.<br/><br/>Anyway, was there anything at our game, Don, that you thought was social-contract-unfair?</blockquote>\nI was, in fact, debating for the sake of debate, that I hadn't changed the rules.  no doubt it was a different game they were playing.  I was purely speaking to the written word and the literal and not to the spirit of the game itself.  I more added "rules" than changed them, I'd say but, again, it was a VERY different game than normally expected out of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I don't think it was a matter of unfair.  Rather, several folk enlightened me to their expectations and what they got was a different experience.  It was hard to quantify at first but I think I figured out part of the issue:<br/><br/>D&amp;D and games like at are about expectations, specifically.  They are about controlling the odds and the action through the mechanics in very finite quantifiable terms.  When I played it I used to do the very same thing.  I would be assured that the adversary would only have X spells and only so many of them.  He could only move X spaces based on his level, class, race and certain feats.  He could only jump so high based on his Strength and Jump scores.  When the GM acted outside these limits I would call him on it - not to say he can't do that but to let him know that I knew he broke the rules.  <br/><br/>In a Story Game the focus is on good story.  I use as much of the general game mechanics as possible focusing on modifiers more than squares and rounds.  But I think that the story effect of the scene often works outside those parameters that the players expect.<br/><br/>For example: I played a game recently for a friend trying to learn more of the mechanics and she wanted me to be "that difficult gamer that knows the rules."  So we got into the final battle with a spell caster.  I cast Touch of Idiocy to lower her Will save and my cohort cast Hold Person.  End of combat.  Heck.  We didn't even have to kill her.  We tied her up and put her under water until she went unconscious.  By the time she made her save round to round she was done.<br/><br/>In another game I played a grappler.  We faced some big bad elementalist and his elemental minions.  Someone cast flight and enlarge on me and I charged and pinned him.  That's all I did.  Pin and some damage every round.  My grapple check was so high there was such a small chance he could break free. The bard convinced the elementals that they were free to go back to their home planes (we accidentally found some doorways to the planes).  Done.  The mage got off one fireball that did some damage because he rolled a 20 and I rolled a 1 to break the pin.  I reapplied it.<br/><br/>In a Story Game you just don't ever get those lockdowns unless everyone at the table wants that.

In a game where advancing the plot often depends on killing stuff, you want your character to be really good at killing stuff. At the same time though, when killing stuff is such a big part of the game, you want the process of killing stuff to feel exciting and dangerous. It can be very difficult to achieve the former without sacrificing the latter -- especially for spellcasters, who get all kind of effective but boring "save-or-die" type spells. <br/><br/>The last time I played a wizard in a D&amp;D game, it struck me that in combat I was faced with a dilemma very similar to the one I faced as a DM -- trying to pull my punches just enough to be effective in combat without spoiling anyone else's fun. Instead of making tactical decisions from a "what's the best way to defeat this opponent" standpoint, it was more of a "hmm, I could cast this save-or-die spell and end the encounter before anyone else even gets to go, or I could cast this insanely damaging spell and leave the fighter feeling totally outclassed, but that's lame too... oh, wait, I know! The rogue hasn't been getting many chances to sneak attack lately, so I'll cast <i>improved invisibility</i> on her to help her out."<br/><br/>Kind of an interesting tactical exercise, I supposed, but certainly not the one I signed up for when I sat down to roll up a character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77265/#Comment_77265" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-23T11:15:23+00:00" title="June 23, 2007 11:15AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2007 12:28PM by Judd.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don,<br/><br/>This thread makes no sense to me.<br/><br/>I don't grok what you are saying at all.<br/><br/>All I can get is that you played D&amp;D and didn't have such a good time. <br/><br/>Huh?<br/><br/>Creating good conflicts for D&amp;D games is an out and out gaming technique and a damned difficult one to master.<br/><br/>It sounds like you were using a screwdrive but still wanted to drive the nails in rather than just pick up a damned hammer (because what would one of these threads be without a bad metaphor).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77266/#Comment_77266" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-23T11:19:33+00:00" title="June 23, 2007 11:19AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron - That's interesting!<br/><br/>It is pretty hard to have every challenge spotlight everyone in the party in D&amp;D - I know when I run the game it's pretty rare that more than 1-2 people are spotlighted in every challenge.

I'm pretty sure that, without the story-gaming techniques, my interest in the game would have petered out by now.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm talking about a milder shade of story-gaming than the OP was going for, though?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77315/#Comment_77315" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T07:53:26+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  7:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, Ron is on target with the narrative dysfunction found in my standard mode of play for D&amp;D.  This is a classic example of how playing the GAME well make for a poor story.  And why do I and others do it?  Because the rules allow them to.  Rules dictate game play.  If they don't then than I support that the group is no longer playing THAT game - <i>but that's another thread and one I suspect has been beating the proverbial dead horse.  </i> <br/><br/>Judd,  The premise (and the thread has gone pretty off track from my inital post) is that when faced with a group I am not familiar with (or more to the point are not familiar with me) just saying we're playing D&amp;D and trying to tell a good story is not enough to meet the expectations at the table.  And chatting about it just before play isn't a viable means of setting up expectation because you have the players attention and commitment already.  Socially they are more likely to play and not have fun than bow out.  Let's take a convention or a game day for example.  If a player reads a little blurb or even comes to the table because he sees there are D&amp;D books, by the time he realizes, gee, this isn't for me and it's completely different than I play this game, he's already invested in the slot.  His decision is tough it out (maybe make the best of it or maybe sow dissent) or go through the social discomfort (for some) of leaving and tryiing to get into a game that has already started.<br/><br/>Yes, we already talked about the "I solve that by playing with people I know."  That's not what we're discussing for those that would interject it.  This is for those who would be interested in introducing story games to a group of strangers or a reluctant play group with a medium they would otherwise be familiar with.  I'm saying that in THAT situation you're already breaking social contract before coming to the table and doing so may cause more harm than good.<br/><br/>Chris, did you'r group meet any of the initial caveats I set out there?\n<blockquote>Okay, so first the caveats. If you're going to try heavy Story Game techniques with a bunch of hippie gamers then all is well. If you're going to introduce some of these ideas into your game group and they are all completely on board and looking forward to a new style of play, then by all means try it out.</blockquote>\nOne different I see from your examples is that I am basically removing tactical combat from the game.  The game progresses by scenes where we roleplay a bit, find the conflict, set stakes and roll (one roll per character per scene).  The skills, feats, and equipment you bring into the scene give you standard bonuses.  I establish a DC that usually includes an opposed roll and whoever wins the roll gets their stakes and whoever loses the roll get to narrarate.  Comprimise comes from the final numbers being within 1 or 2 of one another.  My current incarnation allows the players to dictate how tough they want an adversary to be by stating how many scenes it will take to defeat the foe and stakes are then designed around doing damage or disadvantaging the enemy somehow.  The only character choices I recommend against are things that deal with movement or attacks of opportunity since they need to be changed to drastically to make this all work.  Otherwise we've used most everything as intended (aiding one another becomes more important and dramatically significant, using syergy bonuses, etc.  Characters still take HP in damage scene to scene.  Armor and such become bonuses to defensive stakes, etc.)<br/><br/>So I suppose the interesting piece here, for me, was how I could be using the same ruleset (sure, maybe at this point it would look something like a homebrew) but it be a different game than someone would expect to be playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77318/#Comment_77318" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T08:02:29+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  8:02AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an addendum to this I'd like to mention that I played another playtest version of this for Free RPG Day yesterday.

The game is being made to serve two masters. Eruditus wants it to be about creating shared fiction but there are these books full of mechanics that are not about creating shared fiction, they are about killing things and taking their stuff. The game mechanics are about creating characters that kills things well and take stuff well, even if that sacrifices story. You don't HAVE to sacrifice story, but if you're playing D&amp;D the game will fight you.<br/><br/>For example, your character Reginald the Brave wields a blade that was passed down to him from his father and his father before that. Its cool. It's got his family crest stamped into the pommel. Nice. Then he goes down a whole and finds a +5 Vorpal Avenger of Extreme Badassery. Which one are you going to take up against the black dragon in the next room?<br/><br/>Another example, Reginald the Brave about to lead a party of intrepid adventurers against the evil liche king that is terrorizing the town. Reginald is Brave and Resolute and completely awesome. So, what does he do? He bravely waits at the Inn and tries to recruit a rogue so that they can disable any traps and open any locked doors they find along the way. Then he seeks the help of a cleric so that they have sufficient healing to enable them to succeed. The rules promote this by making it difficult to succeed without them. Then the party, properly balanced, sets off into the dungeon where they come upon a door. Reginald the Brave calls for the cunning and sneaky rogue to approach the door and check it for traps while Reginald the Brave holds back a safe distance. This routine is repeated every ten feet along the corridor and at every door, chest, grate, or other "scary" item. Again the rules tend to promote this kind of play. What happened to all the brave and intrepid?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77352/#Comment_77352" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T13:52:12+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  1:52PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2007 1:54PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>For example, your character Reginald the Brave wields a blade that was passed down to him from his father and his father before that.

Which one are you going to take up against the black dragon in the next room?</blockquote>\nThis seems to be another example of making out-of-game choices that are directly at odds with you having fun: if this was a hardcore story game, you'd have to put in the work to make that antique sword cool.  Maybe it would have nifty powers.  Maybe it would be a symbol of how awesome Reginald's family is.  Maybe looking at the crest in the pommel would remind him of where he came from and give him the strength to rise to any challenge.  If it's just an ordinary sword in every respect, there's no reason for Reggie to hang on to it in <i>any</i> game if a better option comes along.  Even in a story game, you have to integrate that sword into the character and the setting and make it significant, or it's not really going to mean anything.<br/><br/>Your problem here isn't that D&amp;D is thoroughly incompatible with story game techniques.  You're setting up a D&amp;D gameworld where +5 Vorpal Avengers of Extreme Badassery are sitting around in holes waiting to be discovered, and you're not using any of the options D&amp;D provides that might make Reggie's Family Sword anything other than an ordinary piece of sharpened steel.  Hell, you could use the Legacy weapons rules.  The GM could replace the +5 Vorpal Avenger in the hole with a pile of cash or expensive goods, and then Reggie could pay a wizard to enchant his family sword.  You could make his family sword an even cooler magic weapon than a Vorpal Avenger, but attach a string to it (like, it's intelligent, and won't open up its full awesomeness to Reggie until he proves himself truly worthy of it).  You could even incorporate story games-type mechanics for the sword, giving him circumstance bonuses for various rolls when he's carrying it.  You could, in other words, put in the work to make Reggie's Family Sword a better option than anything else that comes along, exactly the same way you would if you were playing something other than D&amp;D.<br/><br/><br/>As far as the second example goes, you're right: D&amp;D does not easily support a game where one man can pick up a sword and go charging headlong into the Liche King's castle and succeed.  You can tweak it to create that kind of survivability, but the baseline game is "adventurers are tougher than normal people, but usually not tougher than the things they're fighting," and its built-in niche protection makes it nigh-impossible to make any headway on a typical by-the-book adventure if you don't have the traditional fighter-cleric-wizard-thief party.  Reggie's even worse off if the GM is clinging to the old-school "Coming back from the dead should be difficult" meme, because now the Raise-Dead safety net that the game rules provide for mid-level players to encourage them to take greater risks has been removed.<br/><br/>Again, as others have said, if you want to break that mold, you've got to talk about it with the players (to realign their expectations) and you've got to tweak the rules (to support the kind of play you want).  If you don't do either one of those, then no, D&amp;D won't support story games-style play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77395/#Comment_77395" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T22:16:20+00:00" title="June 24, 2007 10:16PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2007 10:18PM by noclue.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well the sword example is a bit of hyperbole. But it works just as well if your family sword is a +3 holy avenger of badassery and you find the +5, or if your family sword is a simple +2 sword and you find a +3. You might say "I'm gonna stick with the sword of my father!" But at some point you're gonna run into a gargoyle and need that +3 to hit the beastie. I actually agree with lots of your suggestions. You can use all sorts of story game mechanics to make the sword cool and you can set up a D&amp;D world where uber weapons are not found in every hole (although they seem to be in many). My point is the system you're playing tends to fight you by rewarding strategies that have little to do with story and more to do with exploiting the game mechanics to achieve a goal. I have nothing against using game mechanics to this end, by the way. It is why they were created. But, it is an example of why someone might feel "forced" to do things by the game that they felt were not "fun" (from a story-gamer's perspective).<br/><br/>And my checking for trap example wasn't about charging headlong (although my characters often choose that option and sometimes die for it). Its about story. Imagine a novel in which we get to read along as the hero searches this ten foot section, then searches that ten foot section, as they progressed down a hallway. Not a particularly spooky hallway, just one of many they will encounter in this particular tale. Or a better example, when I used to play (1st edition) we would sometimes rest for several days inside a dungeon to heal up. We weren't particularly hurt. But its just a few more random monster rolls to get several nights rest. Where's the story in that? Or, monks. Say you want to play a cool monk with a bo staff. But, after a few levels your hands are doing like 3x the damage of a bo staff (hypothetically, I have no idea how the actual rules go). So, now you're a monk who has a bo staff he never uses. In a story game frame of mind, I'd just say "ok, you can have the unarmed combat damage when you use the bo staff." Now you're a cool monk with a bo staff again.<br/><br/>Oh, and on the Raise dead thingy, that's a great example of system getting in the way of fun for me. I'm a definitely a "coming back from the dead should be damned hard" kinda guy myself. It is a safety net that just takes the stuffing out of the strongest (and fun-est) emotion the game can engender, a sense of jeopardy.  Raise dead does not "encourage greater risk taking," it makes risky things safe. The implications on the story are astronomical. If you know you're coming back, why not charge the Balrog? If he kills you, big deal. The cleric can pray for more mana points tonight. The problem for me is that "big deal" is rarely a term I associate with good stories. The death of a character or a close comrade is something that I generally want to feel in my gaming and I want resurrection to remain miraculous. Of course, YMMV.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77407/#Comment_77407" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T01:37:17+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  1:37AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, here's the thing:  the D&amp;D rules as written make it very likely that a PC will be killed at some point.  It's a game where most conflicts boil down to "succeed or die," and since you can't succeed all the time, you can expect that sooner or later a character's going to go toes-up on you.<br/><br/>Which, incidentally, is <i>exactly why</i> you see people, including yourself, playing their D&amp;D characters as incredibly cautious rather than as daring risk-takers.  Unlike a story game, the standard-issue D&amp;D game <i>will</i> kill a PC.  It will kill a PC randomly, at an undramatic time, in a manner that does not significantly add to the story.  You will eventually get a bad roll at the same time that the GM gets a good roll, and your character will be d-e-a-d.  And that blows, for both the player and for any game in which there is a continuing story that the PC is actively involved in.  Which is probably why you don't see a lot of story games where someone's character can be removed from the game randomly and without anyone's consent.<br/><br/>So, yes, I will reiterate:  <i>Raise Dead</i> is a safety net.  It's a way of taking the default stakes of a D&amp;D conflict (victory or death) and turning them into something smaller and less permanent, providing more options for the GM and players alike.<br/><br/>You can institute other safety nets, of course: I think their Eberron setting added action dice, which can be spent in ways that will reduce/eliminate the unplanned-death problem.  A lot of people have a house rule that says you're not dead until you're at -X or -2X hitpoints, where X is your Constitution score.  You can even explicitly state a "I'm not going to kill your characters when I can capture them, maim them, or otherwise make them miserable instead" clause when you're pitching your campaign.  All of these are wonderful options and I totally recommend them.  But just 'cause you don't like <i>Raise Dead</i> doesn't change the fact that it's there to protect the PCs...and by extension, to protect the story.<br/><br/><br/>Getting back to the story-games thrust of this topic, I think the single best use of story game mechanics in D&amp;D is using them to set up conflicts other than "succeed or die."  Once the random mortality of the system is mitigated in some way, either by changing what most encounters are about or even just by house-ruling an escape clause for PCs, D&amp;D ends up being nearly as good at hippie-game style fun as a system expressly designed for it.<br/><br/>With sudden permanent character death off the table, everyone's more free to develop deeper, more interesting characters.  There's less reason to play the "I search for traps every 10 feet" and "Let's just camp here tonight and heal" cards.  There's more room for complicated, PC-driven plots to spring up.  You can start to mix in novel-like elements like skipping over boring stuff (because now you know the characters are going to survive to reach the good parts).  You can even make the climax of the story bigger and cooler by putting PC death back on the table for it, and it will finally <i>mean</i> something to the players because it will be new and different from all the other encounters that came before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78131/#Comment_78131" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T12:08:46+00:00" title="June 27, 2007 12:08PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see what your both saying and these are great points.<br/><br/>The sword question becomes an interesting one and on some level COULD lead to some cool decisions - "Do I keep my heirloom weapon or do I upgrade to a spiffier sword?"  Just making the heirloom uber cool defies the genre, I think, in that your gear is getting more poserful as you do.  (The Legacy idea is, of course, a great option for that).  If you make the sword cool and different in a different way than the +5 vorpal defender then the players are likely to just toolbox it and carry around a dozen swords (anyone ever play the ridiculousness that is the Elder Scroll series of computer RPGs where your house gets filled with crazy amounts of weapons and armor?)<br/><br/>James, you're on target in that in this case it worked well.  Why?  because it wasn't really the chatting before the game as it was me being present for the players decision as to which game would be played - not a situation you can be in very often.  I just had am image of a NEW breed of gaming cons where you have hawkers describing their games in from of the sign-up sheets and answering questions about them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78282/#Comment_78282" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T21:44:14+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  9:44PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2007 9:46PM by noclue.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>I see what your both saying and these are great points </blockquote>\nYes, I think we're basically agreeing as to symptom and disagreeing as to remedy.\n<blockquote>The sword question becomes an interesting one and on some level COULD lead to some cool decisions - "Do I keep my heirloom weapon or do I upgrade to a spiffier sword?" </blockquote>\nDefinitely, provided the game is about being the cool dude with the awesome family as much as it is about going down a hole for some vampire bunny smackdown. That's not really a system question. But it is. Compare page counts on smacking vampire bunny stuff to being cool family dude stuff. Which I think sets up the pre-game expectations from players you noted in your OP.\n<blockquote> Just making the heirloom uber cool defies the genre, I think, in that your gear is getting more poserful as you do. </blockquote> If "poserful" wasn't on purpose, you should claim it was. "Poserful" is fantastic! <br/><br/>Ultimately, if the heirloom is to continue to be a meaningful story element, I think you are setting up a choice between making it uber so it can be part of the fun, or drifting the game so a non-uber sword isn't un-fun (a triple negative anyone?). Which really gets to the heart of my comment about why someone might do things because of game mechanics that they feel are not fun.\n<blockquote>James, you're on target in that in this case it worked well.
