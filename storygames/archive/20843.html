I had MC\u2019d a couple of games of AW before but in hindsight the results were less than satisfying. Mostly due to the disjoint between the fact that I hate wasting time on prep and that I\u2019m the narrator kind of MC: I tell a story and the players are along for the ride. Since rpg players never do what they\u2019re supposed to you either need to railroad the fun out of it all to get use out of the prep or you improvise, and I\u2019ve been all about the impro.<br/><br/><br/>I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m drawn to the idea of \u201cplay to find out\u201d. But my earlier forays into AW had my steelfingered grip on the MC reins clash a bit with this. I read the MC principles and agendas but didn\u2019t put them to use. I especially did not use the fronts, because why would I? I could just make that up on the way. It seemed artificial and bolted on. And the only questions I asked were what to call people but the players always deferred that to me. But even though the tale of Joe\u2019s Scrapyard had people more engaged than anything we had played in a while it didn\u2019t give me the feeling I expected and we stopped playing.<br/><br/><br/>But AWs apparent simplicity spoke to me. I have a hard time remembering complicated rules and my interest is always in the fiction, not the rules. So I tried making my own hack to play Death Watch, the space marine rpg. We played it, it was fun but somehow it didn\u2019t gel. I figured I needed to polish it more.<br/><br/><br/>Then I started making a hack where you play the last giants in medieval england. I still haven\u2019t tried to actually play it but I realized I needed to sharpen my AW-fu and revise it first. But the problem is me and my friends are all grown up and our nerd-time is limited. And unfortunately it\u2019s RPG\u2019s that have fallen off the radar.<br/><br/><br/>But serendipitously three of my friends moved away into exile at the same time, and all have an RPG itch to scratch. So I enticed them into trying out this new-fangled video-conference roleplaying. Myself, I\u2019ve just bought a house, and this black hole in my economy is why we\u2019re playing first ed. AW\u2026<br/><br/><br/>A thing I learned from earlier AW forays is that player investment in the game is tremendously increased by joint world building. So I had my three players take turns answering these questions to set up our post apocalypse:<br/>1. What caused the apocalypse?<br/>2. What year did it happen?<br/>3. How quick was it?<br/>4. How long time has passed since the apocalypse?<br/>5. Where are we?<br/>6. What is the biggest scarcity?<br/>7. What is the biggest threat?<br/>8. What does the Maelstrom feel like?<br/><br/><br/>They really got into it so the setting for <i>Mangrocalypse</i> is that total ecological collapse caused the apocalypse in the 1920\u2019s. Was it british gas warfare gone haywire, extreme volcanic action in italy or something else that caused it? Nobody really knows what happened, but the result was dust in the atmosphere, global cooling, unstable weather and Europe lost to the world. The apocalypse was slow, it took twenty years for the full effect to be apparent. Now a further twenty years have passed, it is 1962. We are in Port Bartholomew, an old english refuelling port in north eastern Malaysia. It sits in the mangrove swamps on what used to be solid ground but now is the hazy border between jungle and sea. The area is erratically hit by storms and monsoons and the biggest scarcity is shelter. The dark threat at the horizon is the eventual return of the british colonial warlords and the Maelstrom feels like slimy dark swamp water.<br/><br/><br/>With this setting the players chose their characters:<br/><b>Wei</b>, the Angel. A young man, only 18 years old, malay, with a kind face and laughing eyes. Lives on an old motorboat, sans motor, rebuilt into a home. Does not have a surgery but does home calls. Is Touched by death [+1weird if somebody dies in his care] and has Battlefield grace [+1armor when caring for  someone, not fighting in battle].<br/><br/><br/><b>Frankie</b>, the driver. A man in his 30s, malay, wears utility overalls, is handsome. Works at Swoosh\u2019s Mechanical, a repairshop, were he also bunks down and moors his boat. His boat is rugged and looks handcrafted from collected scrap metal. It is also extremely loud since it\u2019s the swamp boat variant with a huge fan in the rear. He is a No shit driver [his boat] and a Daredevil [+1 to rolls if being reckless]<br/><br/><br/><b>Azure Monsoon</b>, the Battle Babe. A wrinkled woman in her 50s, malay, she dresses in a traditional colorful dress padded with leather armor, she is muscular and totes around a huge elephant rifle and a lajatang, a traditional double bladed spear. She is Ice Cold [Cool instead of Hard when Going Aggro] and Merciless [Harm+1]. For a week, since she arrived with the post boat she has lived at the inn in Port Barth, the Windjammer.<br/><br/><br/>We only had two and a half hour for our first session and beginning with with a rules overview followed by making the setting and then the characters we only had an hour for the real first session. But regardless it gave me plenty to work with.<br/><br/><br/>I always try to make campaign chronicles, because memory works fine if you play every week but then you have to cancel one time and the next session nobody really remembers what happened. But earlier attempts at writing have all followed the same pattern: Ambitious and detailed reports the first two or three meetings, and then nothing, since I don\u2019t want the quality to diminish but I can\u2019t get myself to actually write. So this time I\u2019ve tried to emulate IMDBs episode guides for TV-series.<br/><br/><br/>In the following posts I\u2019ll post the session-report and then follow up with my MC observations. Feel free to comment or ask questions. I\u2019m doing this to improve after all.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457606/#Comment_457606" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-28T14:27:09+00:00" title="October 28, 2016  2:27PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Listening.

I think it is because of the world creation list I\u2019d found that we used. It has examples, which always tend to run away with people's imagination. I love the use of color, which i think is one of the reasons I like AW.<br/><br/><br/>As for the apocalypse being local I think this game has the whole world suffering the affects but the PC\u2019s not necessarily at ground zero. But hopefully we\u2019ll see some of the things you mention.<br/><br/>So the first session report looks like this:<br/><br/><b>S01E01: Nice to meet you</b><br/>We are in Port Barth in northeastern Malaysia after the apocalypse where the physician Wei has saved a child's life. Ike Pin-Lao was dying in fever, but thanks to Wei, he has a chance to grow up in a life of misery. Stone cold killer-for-hire Azure Monsoon is forced to realize that the food and lodging the murder of the teenager Slash, on behalf of the Inn\u2019s owner Blood Banjo, has provided are used up and has to find a new job. Frankie, the boat enthusiast, is trying to find out where his boss Swoosh has gone in order to avoid actually working. Wei hooks up with one of Frankie's colleagues and a date is set for the evening. Azure frighten some young people, one of which is the murdered Slash\u2019s little brother, the other is one of Frankie\u2019s colleagues. Zuzu Jupiter\u2019s circus arrives in town with the mail boat and Frankie's boss shows up just to escape mysteriously after seeing Azure.<br/><br/><br/><b>Behind the scenes</b> (Oh my am I wordy):<br/>It was the usual first session stuff and I tried to follow the rules by asking, asking, asking, asking. \u201cSo Wei, it\u2019s morning, where are you?\u201d (Coming out of a hovel where I spent the night saving a child\u2019s life from fever.) \u201cFrankie what\u2019re you up to?\u201d (Coming in fast in my boat, late for work having been out just boating. Boating where? Nowhere, just crusin\u2019.) \u201cWhere\u2019s Azure having breakfast?\u201d (At Windjammer, the local inn, run by Blood Banjo. OK, how is he like? He\u2019s like soup nazi from Seinfeld. He makes delicious food, but he\u2019s an evil fuck. I killed someone for him, a young punk, and I got food and lodging for a week, but now he\u2019s evicting me.)<br/><br/>The more questions I asked, the more they got into it and a picture of Port Barth started forming and who the characters are. We used a random name generator I\u2019d found on the net for the names and a certain postapoc feel emerged.<br/><br/>Then I didn\u2019t ask and dropped in the circus, because I thought I needed something to stir the pot and the name generator had thrown up Zuzu Jupiter. For some reason this was the name of a ringmaster to me, so I rolled with that.<br/><br/><br/>But from what the players had come up with Port Barth emerged as a 100 people village. The plaza is a plank area that spans between some old piers and arranged around it is Windjammer, the inn of Blood Banjo, a rundown british style pub called Bishops Arms, the General Store and the post pier. Swoosh\u2019s Mechanical is out by the docks and spans both a hangar and a dock, taking both marine and land customers. Currently Frankie and his two co-workers, the twins Taps and Chimes are servicing the village Abeline\u2019s huge water pump.<br/><br/>There\u2019s a small market for second rate food on the swamp side.<br/><br/>Inland are were the rice farming families live, on the swamp/jungle border. About 45 minutes east of Port Barth by boat lies the small community Abeline, known for its fresh water well. One and a half day westward lies Kemaman, the next stop on the post boat route.<br/><br/>Quite a lot from just following the characters around for an hour and everyone was happy with the start, even though nothing much really had happened. I even realized that I\u2019d made a mistake. When Azure threatened Taps, who\u2019d been Slash\u2019s S.O., and Slash\u2019s little brother Weasel to bugger off they were at first cocky and asked who would make them. It shouldn\u2019t even have happened. Azure is <i>the battle babe</i>, both Taps and Weasel should have known who she was and that she was the one who\u2019d killed Slash.<br/><br/>But then I re-read AW and the part were it says to roll with things and then figure them out. Which I did. And the answer is that since Taps aint the sharpest tool in the shed she didn\u2019t believe that the wrinkly old lady could be a killer. So she and Weasel were generally wondering who would help the old prune. Until they saw everybody else at the plaza freeze in what they were doing and reevaluated the situation. Suddenly what made no sense instead deepened an NPC. So far so good for following the rules.<br/><br/>I also have to mention Swoosh. Originally on a whim he wasn\u2019t at the garage when Frankie arrived I thought this would allow for some laid back interaction with his coworkers, but Frankie\u2019s player didn\u2019t bite. Instead he started looking for him so I decided this was \u201cTake away their stuff\u201d and figured that Swoosh had taken the killing of Slash as a hint and was now looking for a getaway. Why or how, we would see.<br/><br/>The post boat was something someone said jokingly as a reference to the Costner cinematic masterpiece The Postman, but I rolled with that. As a symbol of the british colonial power emanating from Singapore the red painted post boat would do its rounds. So that would be Swoosh\u2019s way out. Unfortunately Slash\u2019s killer Azure was right there and he turned tail.<br/><br/>Regarding the post boat everyone agreed that old dirty pound notes was an accepted unit of barter with a going rate of 5\xa3 per barter. As one player put it \u201cEverybody dreams of getting out of this peripheral shit hole and going to the pearl of southeast asia, so everybody\u2019s hoarding pounds to go there but still accepting food and stuff for barter as you have to survive day to day as well\u201d.<br/><br/>As the first session had been a bit short I felt there were pieces missing. Obviously I wouldn\u2019t have dropped in the circus if we\u2019d fleshed out more of the world in play, but still, pieces missing. <br/><br/>Since the pub and the general store weren\u2019t populated I took these as starting points. Azure\u2019s player had decided that Blood Banjo made great food but did not sell any spirits. I asked if Port Barth was a non drinking settlement but then he said \u201cno, there\u2019s a rundown english pub\u201d. That gave a classic conflict of law vs chaos between Blood Banjo and the pub owner. But I also had the general store so I decided that Port Barth would be run by a troika of power players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457731/#Comment_457731" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-31T20:55:17+00:00" title="October 31, 2016  8:55PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Behind the scenes continued, The Fronts</b><br/>I made this my first front: The Troika with countdowns for the three troika parties. I defined them by the establishments: Windjammer, Bishops Arms and The General Store. The front expresses envy (gone bad). It concerns the future of Port Barth and in the stakes is who will rule Port Barth when the dust settles? I didn\u2019t really think any of the agendas really fit, but envy would do.<br/><br/>Blood Banjo at the Windjammer is obviously a Grotesque Mindfucker who craves mastery. The threat is just Blood Banjo. He got the custom move that his food is so good that if you refuse his demands after having eaten you\u2019re acting under fire. His countdown is: Slash is killed - Go after Swoosh - Consolidate Power - Go after the General - Appoint himself dictator. The first step of the countdown is connected to the owner of the pub. <br/><br/>The pub owner is a Grotesque perversion of birth (metaphorically) who craves chaos. S/he has a bouncer. Custom move: If you hit the drink at the pub roll +Barter: 10+ The night of your life, mark 1 exp and if you\u2019re having a adate/meeting you succeed with manipulate/seduce, 7-9: Choose one; Gain 1 STD (1Harm AP) or one additional barter spent. On a miss, both. The countdown is: Start rumor about Slash - foment unrest - Direct any anger towards Blood Banjo - Aggression - Deal with the General store owner - Leave on the post boat. So the reason why Blood Banjo hired Azure to off Slash was a rumor placed by the pub owner\u2026<br/><br/>The third threat is the owner of the General store. S/he is a warlord that craves control and is assisted by a Sheriff, a Harbormaster, a Post officer, and some errand boys. As a custom move if you have defied the general store owner in the past you are acting under fire when dealing with her/him. The countdown is: If there is unrest - Retaliate with violence - Marshal law - The owner is appointed dictator by her/himself - Public hangings to set example - Total control.<br/><br/>So it\u2019s the pub owner that has set the ball running to foment chaos, but the other two crave control. Their own brand of control of course, but the General Store owner thinks bigger. And has the people to back her/him up.<br/><br/>The second front I called The Swamp. It expresses decay and its agenda is to consume Port Barth. The Stakes are: Will Port Barth survive? Will the Embong clan unite the rice farmers? Will Abeline conquer Port Barth? Will sickness take hold?<br/><br/>Here I had four threats: The Embong clan, Abeline, The Swamp, The water.<br/><br/>The Embong clan is a Brute Family with the impulse to close ranks and protect their own. They\u2019re a medium gang (1arm 2 harm) and have two water buffaloes, Bock &amp; Ram. The custom move is: When you go into rice country roll+sharp: 10+ You avoid the ambush, 7-9: You spot it in time to prepare for it or to flee. On a miss you blunder into it. The countdown is: Weasel sent to look for his brother - Weasel reports or disappears - The Embongs gather the rice farmers - They come to Port Barth in force - Violence - War<br/><br/>Abeline is a Brute Hunting Pack with the impulse to victimize vulnerable people and envy. No cast or countdown yet, since we hadn\u2019t seen anything of them yet. But I made a custom move: When dealing with \u201cAbers\u201d roll+Cool: 10+ They respect you. 7-9: Choose one: They double the cost, they surround you, they mess with your gear. On a miss all three.<br/>This was supposed to show Abeline as the small envious village hating its successful neighbor while maintaining an \u201cInnsmouth look\u201d.<br/><br/>The swamp is a Furnace landscape with the impulse to consume things. The custom move is is: When in the swamps roll+weird: 10+ You find your way, 7-9: Choose one: You lose your time, place, gear. On a miss all three. The countdown is: It\u2019s too quiet - Someone is lost in the swamp - Someone is lost in the swamp - Someone is lost in the swamp - Storms - Monsoon (total destruction)<br/><br/>The water is a Breeding pit landscape with the impulse to generate badness. Custom move: If you drink the brackish water roll+Hard: 10+ spend a few minutes barfing then OK. 7-9: 1harm(AP) now and 1harm(AP) later as you\u2019re sick. On a miss 3harm(AP) now, 3harm(AP) later as you\u2019re sick, sick, sick. The countdown is: A PC drinks the water - 2nd PC drinks water - 3rd PC drinks water and gets infected - if not cured quickly 5 named NPC\u2019s will be infected - 15 named NPCs are infected - Outbreak!<br/>When somebody gets infected they suffer 1harm(AP). Don\u2019t roll custom move. Infection is transmitted by body fluids. When infected roll+Hard at session start: 10+ You heal by yourself, 7-9 infection doesn\u2019t worsen. On a miss you take 1harm(AP) and your acting under fire. To heal roll+Angel kit stock spent. 10+: Clear, 7-9 cost 1 add stock.<br/>The countdown is:<br/>This was just to give a feel of how dangerous the swamp is.<br/><br/>The third front was The Circus. It expresses ambition and its agenda is to take their best. The threats are Zuzu Jupiter and Brainwashing. The stake is will Zuzu take their best?<br/><br/>Zuzu Jupiter is a Collector Warlord and it is him and his circus. Custom move: When Zuzu touches you roll+Wierd: 10+ Clear, 7-9: Zuzu tells you what to do, mark experience if you do. On a miss you wake up without remembering anything but having done what he wanted. The countdown is: Arrives in Port Barth - Scouts talent - Makes them an offer they can\u2019t refuse - Brainwashes them - Makes them show obedience in public - leaves and takes them with him. The brainwash isn\u2019t really hashed out but the countdown is something like: First successful touch - second successful touch - third successful touch - under fire to disobey - Males you do something you don\u2019t want - Owns you.<br/><br/>The last one is iffy and I need to rework it into something more suited to the threats and fronts framework.<br/><br/>But on the whole I loved the fronts on my first try. They take some time to put together, but not too much, and gives you as a MC an easy tool set to manage off stage badness and NPC clashing interests without having to keep it all in your head. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve mangled the intent of some of it, and some things, like drinking the water, is overcomplicated.<br/><br/>A front that is missing is the british colonial warlords, but since we hadn\u2019t touched upon it at all in our first session, I think I\u2019ll wait a bit with that to see how the story unfolds. Also I\u2019d forgotten to do a home front. And I didn\u2019t use the first session sheet at all. Oops.<br/><br/>But so far so good. <br/><br/><b>What I learned</b><br/>Asking questions really work and the fronts are a nifty tool. And I wish I\u2019d kept myself in rein a bit better, but nobody complained about the circus so I guess it's cool. And that rolling with what shows up in play actually works, even when you'd normally just retcon stuff. Also I got reaffirmation that player investment is increased with joint world building. <br/><br/>(And that I should probably keep posts a bit shorter in the future.)<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457804/#Comment_457804" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-02T17:52:36+00:00" title="November  2, 2016  5:52PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Paul, all my AW games have taken place before the present.

It's in swedish, but here's a rough translation:<br/><br/>Basic Questions<br/>1. What happened that caused the catastrophe? (Unknown, nuclear war, plague, aliens, religious endtimes etc.)<br/>2. When did the disaster happen? (Now, in 10 years, in the 70s, in the 30s, etc.)<br/>3. How fast did it happen? (One day, one year, five years, ten years, etc.)<br/>4. How much time has passed since the disaster? (A generation, two hundred years, last year, it is still ongoing etc.)<br/>5. Where are we? (In the archipelago, in the desert, among the ruins, on the sea, in the woods, etc.)<br/>6. What is the biggest scarcity? (Water, food, fuel, heat, oxygen, etc.)<br/>7. Biggest threat? (Slavery, cannibalism, disease, the environment, etc.)<br/>8. The psychic maelstrom, how does it feel? (As a maelstrom, as a sound, like a feeling, like a children's book etc)<br/><br/>In depth<br/>1. What happened is perhaps the most defining of the world. If, for example, there was some kind of plague that caused the downfall, it will teach people in general to be very suspicious of strangers.<br/>2. This response sets the standard for how life looks like. If it is the post-apocalyptic seventies, it's sideburns and muscle cars all the way. If it is the thirties, it's all about tommy guns and trench coats.<br/>3. Are people still shocked or have they had time to adapt?<br/>4. This answers the question about how the world is run, and if there is anyone who still remember the good old days.<br/>5. This question determines what kind of game world we start in. Remember that we can be on a different world, after the disaster, if you want to be a little crazy.<br/>6. This question is a bit so-so. In the desert, you lack both food, water and fuel, but it is mostly to set theme.<br/>7. This answer sheds some more light on the culture of the area.<br/>8. You can skip this question and answer it when someone uses the maelstrom first time. Maybe you have gotten a feel for the world by then and that gives what the maelstrom is.<br/><br/><br/>Examples<br/>"Vanilla Apocalypse World"<br/>1. Nuclear weapons, clearly nuclear weapons.<br/>2. About five to ten years, a little more high tech gadgets are in circulation<br/>3. It went quickly<br/>4. Around 50 years, there are a few who were children before the disaster, but they are old and confused now.<br/>5. In the desert.<br/>6. Water, food, fuel, everything.<br/>7. Violence.<br/>8. As a maelstrom that sucks everything out of you.<br/><br/><br/>"Forest World"<br/>1. It was bioweapons that unleashed spores in the atmosphere.<br/>2. In a hundred years, everything is sci-fi hightech.<br/>3. Some years.<br/>4. Two years ago. The disaster has just subsided.<br/>5. In the forest, most of it is dense vegetation now.<br/>6. Spore free air.<br/>7. Disease.<br/>8. A clear tone / vibration.<br/><br/><br/>"Waterworld"<br/>1. Global warming.<br/>2. Nineties.<br/>3. Some years.<br/>4. A few generations.<br/>5.The sea, in the warm latitudes.<br/>6. Clean water, fuel.<br/>7. Inbreeding.<br/>8.

Azure is independently commissioned, by both the inn owner Blood Banjo and the business owner Tweedledum, to ensure that the circus disappears. Zuzu Jupiter proves to be interested in finding new talent for his circus but when he learns that Wei is the best doctor in the world he takes Wei onboard the mail boat. There Wei saves the life of Zuzu\u2019s partner who has suffered a knife throwing accident. Contrary to expectation Zuzu is not overly pleased. Wei experiences something supernatural and drowns in the swamp, as it feels. Zuzu Jupiter convinces Bishop, the bar owner, to lend Bishop's Arms to the circus and the tent is set up on the square in front of it. Azure manages to get a place with the circus with her knife throwing capability under the idea that it is easier to destroy something from within than from without. Wei wakes up again without apparent detriment, but is shocked and decides to consult the library at the store to learn more about the supernatural. On the way there, he is stopped by Ambassador and the other hunters outside the General Store. They are angry at having been evicted from Bishop's Arms and Ambassador also has a sore foot. When it turns out that Wei has to amputate the atmosphere becomes tense and Sheriff Patch agrees to let Azure control the situation with her two-bladed spear. Violence subsides however, and they get to the inn to borrow the right tools for the job. Following the hunters there Azure is stopped by Weasel, Slash\u2019s little brother. He threatens that the Embong clan will have revenge. Azure kills him and dumps the body in the swamp. Then Wei succeeds in amputating Ambassador\u2019s leg in an extremely protracted, bloody and messy bout of outdoors surgery.<br/><br/><br/><b>Behind the scenes:</b><br/>Following my front making after the first session we started out by naming some of the characters and defining who they are.<br/><br/>Bishop\u2019s Arms is owned by Bishop, a fifty year old muscular lightskinned british racist asshole who thinks she carries the white woman\u2019s burden. And, since everything\u2019s gone to hell, waits to see it all go up in flames. Bishop is assisted by her bouncer called Clumsy, a vietnamese man of uncertain age who also happens to be the biggest person in the PC known world.<br/><br/>The General Store is run by Tweedledum, a correct british gentleman of medium height in his thirties, with a pencil line mustache usually only dressed in a tank top and his black leather pants. Sees himself as the British Empire\u2019s representative carrying the white man\u2019s burden with wide streaks of misogynism. At his beck and call are a couple of so far unnamed thugs and:<br/>Smokes, the postmaster, so far undetailed.<br/>Patch, the sheriff, a tall chinese man with wispy hair and really bad posture, dresses in khaki, colonial style, and carries a six shooter on each hip.<br/>Sabre, the harbor master, malay with a pirate complex. Dresses like it\u2019s talk like a pirate day every day but does not talk like a pirate. Has a large sabre for show but is an effective bureaucrat.<br/><br/>Then we started playing.<br/>Frankie\u2019s player was unable to play but the other two wanted to so Frankie quickly disappeared out of the picture. I\u2019m considering what kind of love letter he\u2019ll get next time, but nothing has really gelled yet. Following the fronts both Blood Banjo and Tweedledum wanted order so they could focus on their power struggle, and Azure wasn\u2019t going to argue.<br/><br/>Wei\u2019s player has posited him as a person with a morbid personality what with an \u201cunusual anatomical interest\u201d and his Touched by death skill. But in play he\u2019s a really nice guy. So I wanted to probe this. So I asked if Wei had demanded payment for helping Ike Pin-Lao (see last episode). Yes of course, she replied. But they\u2019re poor so I\u2019m accepting foodstuffs. I have to admit she did a perfect layup for a smash: Nam, father of Ike, shows up with a big bag of rice looking both thankful and tearful. Wei understands that he\u2019s happy that Ike\u2019s life is saved, but also that this is their last food. Being such a nice guy he turns down the rice and Nam exclaims that \u201cYou are the nicest person in the world!\u201d.<br/><br/>Zuzu Jupiter is always looking for the best talent and decides to see if Wei really is the nicest. Iknow, here I was really testing Wei\u2019s player. But she did sacrifice some of Wei\u2019s stock in trying to help Jupiter\u2019s partner Serpente (I love random name generators). I figured it was part of taking away the player\u2019s things, and she did use some stock, but only managed 7-9, so Jupiter\u2019s partner would be out for a long time. Then Jupiter touched him and Wei\u2019s player missed the Weird roll for the custom move, wonderful!<br/><br/>Azure managed to impress Zuzu Jupiter\u2019s aide Chang-with-the-wallet enough to get introduced to Jupiter and inducted to the show, but nothing happened when they shook hands to seal the deal.<br/><br/>Then Wei\u2019s nerdy player wanted to go to the library to learn more about the supernatural. \u201cWhere is there even a library in Barth?\u201d I asked and she said \u201cat the General Store, of course.\u201d But outside the store where the angry evicted hunters who used to hang out at Bishop\u2019s Arms which now housed the circus watched over by a nervous Patch, the sheriff.<br/><br/>I have to admit I was interested in putting Wei in a spot to find out what really makes him tick. And I figure, him being all good guy and all, this spot needs to be where his usefulness is compromised, i.e. his stock is spent and healing turns into roll-and-hope or a hunt to get more stock. Plus I got the vibe when Wei saved Serpente that Wei\u2019s player wants to be a hero and actually save people, regardless of Marked for death. So one of the hunters, Ambassador, a big burly bear like person complains about a sore foot but when the boot comes off it\u2019s gangrene. Wei delivers the bad news and is surrounded by upset hunters who demand that he save Amabassador\u2019s foot.<br/><br/>Azure hears the commotion and seeing how ill-prepared Patch is to take on a gang of hunters she offers to \u201csettle the situation\u201d, violently. Pressed he agrees but before she can let her spear do the talking Wei has settled the gang and is ordering them to help him. A procession marches to Bishop\u2019s Arms because Wei wants to operate indoors. But Clumsy is implacable, only circus people allowed inside. Everything is threatening to turn violent but Wei heads them off towards Windjammer.<br/><br/>Azure is stopped by Weasel who threatens with the revenge of the Embong clan but Azure is not impressed. Azures player wanted to go Aggro, but I didn\u2019t allow it since she is the battle babe and he is one unarmed teenager. So we had a good discussion about violence and the moves and how they\u2019re supposed to work. Then Azure killed Weasel with nobody witnessing it and just dumping the body in the swamp.<br/><br/>Then Blood Banjo stopped anybody from amputating anything inside, he doesn\u2019t like blood all over the furnitures, but he allowed for bringing a table and a saw outside. Wei hit an 8 and the operation turned out much bloodier and exhausted all his stock but finally he succeeded in saving Ambassador\u2019s life.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458054/#Comment_458054" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-13T11:45:54+00:00" title="November 13, 2016 11:45AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What I learned:</b><br/>Go Aggro is as complicated to get as people have been hinting, but I think we\u2019ll land in an understanding. I still have an easier time with making the characters lives interesting than playing to find out, and I think I\u2019m too worried with how to drive the fiction to allow for more rolls, to engage the game side of RPG:s, rather than focussing on the fiction. But steady wins the race. Also I realize with hindsight that I am actually stopping myself from putting the npc:s in the crosshairs, which I\u2019ll have to be better at. I guess I\u2019m just afraid of depopulating the port that we\u2019ve created, but that is allowed...<br/><br/>I guess I have to make a new threat in Barth called The Hunters, and set up the home front, and the colonial warlords which I\u2019d forgotten, but I think we\u2019ve got stuff moving nicely.

Frankie takes Swoosh all the way to Kemaman in exchange for the keys to the workshop and the ownership certificate. Unfortunately, when they reach the destination the tank is empty and he can\u2019t afford to pay pumplord Pumper in Kemaman. But Pumper offers him a deal: To take a grenade and blow up Azure. Frankie reluctantly agrees. Meanwhile, Azure allows herself to be given the night of her life at Bishops Arms by Patch, the sheriff, and manages to get herself drunk, laid and appointed deputy sheriff. When Frankie comes back to Barth things get awkward when the twins Taps and Chimes for a moment consider killing him. But instead they all become three-part shareholders in Swoosh\u2019s Mechanical. Frankie goes to hand over the grenade to Azure. Azure has a supernatural experience of drowning in the swamp after talking with Zuzu Jupiter. After an intermezzo in the square, where everyone in Barth becomes witnesses, the grenade is somewhere out there in the swamp and Frankie, soaked in mud, is sentenced to severe penalties for having introduced hazardous explosives to the empire\u2019s outpost. When Azure then rescinds her deputization Patch suffers a breakdown. Mason Storm, the remarkable fine mechanic comes out of the swamp, where he unsuccessfully tried to fish. He is approached by Taps wondering if he can build a deadly trap for a single person which Mason agrees to. They hear a shot and when they come to the square Patch is dead. No one knows if he shot himself or was executed by Tweedledum. The Sheriff post is now officially available. Azure manages to accidentally break the wall at the General Store and is punished on the spot by Tweedledum. A shot in the stomach seem reasonable. Mason indulges himself with the night of his life at the Bishop's Arms. He wakes up in a bad condition, with far too little money in his pocket and a sexually transmitted disease, without a single clue about who he got it from.<br/><br/><br/><b>Behind the scenes</b><br/>Well, Wei\u2019s player couldn\u2019t join and Mason\u2019s player got delayed at work. So we started by resolving Frankie\u2019s and Azure\u2019s loveletters.<br/><br/>Frankie was told that last session Swoosh had forced him to take him out to sea on his boat. Apparently Blood Banjo had sent Azure to kill Slash as a warning, Swoosh would be next. So he had to choose between: * Taking Swoosh all the way to Kemaman to get the keys, the deed and become indebted to pumplord Pumper (that\u2019s what you get when asking for player input on names). Oh, and get to know a secret (the twins aren\u2019t really teins, at least not with eachother). *Taking Swoosh to Abiline for six barter, marking experience and then rolling on the Abiline custom move (because \u201cEverybody knows how they are\u201d). *Throwing Swoosh overboard and taking the keys, the deed and the suitcase filled with 20 barter in dirty pound notes. Naturally rolling do something under fire to see if he gets everything.<br/><br/>I told Frankie\u2019s player this letter was to see what kind of person Frankie is and without hesitation he chose the first option. \u201cFrankie is a good guy, trying to do some good\u201d. This was fertile ground to mine for sure.<br/><br/>Azure\u2019s player had earlier said that she\u2019d killed 4 or 5 people in Kemaman before moving on to Barth, so I thought it was some muscle of the local strong man she\u2019d offed. Now I asked the players who the diesel boss was. Pumplord Pumper, a sweaty overweight man in his fifties in a tanktop and a great moustache. He wanted revenge on Azure and told Frankie he could fill up for free if he took a rusty old potato masher hand grenade and blew up Azure. Hesitantly Frankie agreed and went home with the grenade rattling around in a box.<br/><br/>Azure\u2019s loveletter had her either give in to Patch's advances and allowing him to settle his debt to her by offering her the night of her life at Bishop\u2019s or refusing him and making him an enemy. Azure gladly took the offer, aced the custom roll and chose to have Patch make her deputy on top of it all.<br/><br/>Then we started the session proper. Frankie returned and was met by the twins demanding to know where their boss was. Swoosh had begged him not to tell anyone where he was, so Frankie just mumbled something about Swoosh not returning and \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got the keys!\u201d Taps\u2019 drive is to get her own workshop so she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes that Swoosh had left the shop to the good for nothing Frankie. For a while murder was in the air, but Chimes is a lover, not a fighter and Frankie succeeded in manipulating Taps, they would be three way partners.<br/><br/>Azure had her loyalties questioned by Zuzu, how could she become deputy if she was with the circus? Azure tried to point out that it was good to have connections, but Zuzu was disappointed. <br/><br/>Then I dropped the ball big time. Azure\u2019s player missed the custom move for Zuzu and got \u201cyou wake up having already done what he wants\u201d. But I couldn\u2019t figure out what he wanted. Then Frankie went looking for Azure but found only the hunters who said that she was probably off snogging with the sheriff. Then Patch showed up saying he had no idea where she was. For some reason I wanted to put Frankie in a spot by having Patch confront him about the box.<br/><br/>What I should have done was have had Azure already told Patch she was quitting being deputy, at Zuzu\u2019s behest. Instead everything turned wierd when I had Azure saying it against her will to Patch\u2019s face, when she finally turned up. \u201cAm I brain washed?\u201d her player asked, and I said yes and he was like \u201cCool.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t cool, AW is always geared toward player agency, there should always be a player choice involved in how they act, maybe not in what they do. If it makes sense. It would have been ok to have Azure already having quit the job, but not taking over her in the middle of a conversation. I felt like I failed big time.<br/><br/>Also, I hadn\u2019t really understood how much of a good guy Frankie is, which turned the scene at the plaza into something really weird when he just wanted to tell Azure that someone wanted her exploded and everybody else reacted really negative to him bringing an old grenade into town. I think this was a case of playing on webcam and us not really getting each other\u2019s body language, but I don\u2019t know.<br/><br/>Then Mason Storm\u2019s player joined and I tried to move the spotlight around. But it was late and I was a bit fried from work so it all just kind of slowed down. And Frankie\u2019s player had to quit early.<br/><br/>I felt it was a really bad session, but the players were really happy afterward so I guess I somehow powered through thanks to my winning personality or something. I even apologized to Mason\u2019s player for the not so fun first try but he replied \u201cAre you kidding? I get to design a death trap and then my character drinks himself into oblivion and gets laid. What\u2019s not to like?\u201d<br/><br/>I think that what I bring away from this session is a feeling that I didn\u2019t put everything in cross hairs or delivered the feeling that everything balances on the edge of chaos. Mostly because I was trying to balnce stuff myself in order for Mason\u2019s player to be able to join smoothly. I guess I should try to just play to find out instead...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458625/#Comment_458625" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-08T10:55:47+00:00" title="December  8, 2016 10:55AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>S01E04: Everybody needs good neighbours</b><br/>When Wei thinks he\u2019s managed to rescue Ambassador and Serpente both are hit by severe fevers and he realizes that he can only save one of them. He chooses Ambassador. Azure is sent out in the swamp by Zuzu Jupiter to spread the news of the impending circus performance, but gets lost. After a day, she cannot hold out from drinking swamp water, which causes her to vomit blood. Another night and she staggers out of the swamp and sees a watchtower and a few huts that she does not recognize. A person dressed in roots and lianas explains that she has come to Abiline and will meet with the Council. Dizzy, she tries to advertise the circus but the Council sentences her to a fine for trespassing and espionage and calls on her to bring the circus there instead. Wei gets the hunters gratitude for having saved their friend and Zuzu\u2019s mission to do away with Serpentes body. He sells it to Blood Banjo knowing fully well that it will be served as \u201clong-pork\u201d. But he gets to keep the head. He extracts the corneas and ear bones before he heads out to give Serpente\u2019s head a dignified burial in the swamp. But Wei gets lost. Many hours later it starts to darken and Wei happens on a wrinkled little woman called Beak. She laughs and shows the way to Barth, a ten minute walk away. Wei regretfully tells her that her grandsons Slash is dead and Weasel is missing. The next day Wei is trying to buy medicine at the General Store, but they\u2019re all out. He is a silent spectator when Beak gets humiliated by the racist Smokes, and she promises that the Embong clan will have their revenge on both Barth and Wei. Zuzu is dissatisfied with Azure and sends her out in the swamp again regardless of the fact that she is wounded. But Azure stays in her sick bed. A sudden cold gust rustles the leaves and rattle all shutters. A moment of relief from the jungle heat or a premonition of the deadly monsoon?<br/><br/><b>Behind the scenes:</b><br/>Loveletter time! I was particularly happy with Wei\u2019s letter, because it was a tough choice (with Serpente moaning about \u201cwho will take care of my children?\u201d) with a built in benefit, since Wei is Marked by death. Every time somebody dies in his care he gets Weird +1.<br/><br/>Azure\u2019s in turn had her touched by Zuzu and asked to go out into the swamp to get the locals to come to the circus. Missing the swamp roll she loses time, place and gear and ends up in Abiline without her rifle, having drunk blood vomit inducing swamp water. I asked what the Abiliners looked like and apparently they dressed in swamp thing fashion. And are led by a council of yoda-looking old people.<br/><br/>That Banjo bought the body made sense to me, since the sheriff disappeared and nobody cared. Azure\u2019s player was happy that she\u2019d only eaten the tofu dishes. The corneas and ear bones was simply what Wei\u2019s player googled that you could transplant from the head, thanks to the swedish donor\u2019s registry.<br/><br/>Wei naturally got lost, and was found by Beak, comically close to the village. This was to enforce the weirdness of the swamp, which everybody was starting to realize.<br/><br/>The scene where Smokes was unabashedly racist to Beak and Wei did not speak up because he wanted to buy stock for his angelkit got suitably uncomfortable. When Beak promised death Wei couldn\u2019t really deny that he was a douche. Beak\u2019s promise was me announcing future badness.<br/><br/>The wind was also this. I realized I\u2019d forgotten to fill out the countdown for the swamp when Azure and Wei got lost, so the session ended with the eerie feeling of cold wind.<br/><br/><br/><b>What I learned:</b><br/>Gameplay-wise the session was hamstrung by Mason\u2019s player getting stuck at work and finally not beeing able to join. I held back so as to allow him to join without being in the middle of something which lead to everything just being stretched out and not very engaging. We all agreed that this was like that odd out episode in a TV-series where you feel like the producers realized they had to make it one episode longer without the material for it. So a bit of a low point. I clearly felt I need to work on making their lives more interesting.<br/><br/>At the same time my players are getting into how AW works so the playing is going smoother. We\u2019ll have to see how it goes.<br/><br/>As for Paul\u2019s hopes that \u201cthe idea of the apocalypse potentially being fairly *local*, and the possibility of those outsiders, or even people unaffected by it, arriving at some point. Lots of territory there for discovery, social mores, religious positions, and so forth.\u201d I think that so far Mangrocalypse is shaping up to just be no-brains postapoc in an exotic skin. I guess we'll just have to play to find out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
