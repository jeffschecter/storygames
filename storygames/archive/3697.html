After fumbling through the rules for a few minutes, we really got it working well. Had a lot of fun. I picked the Physical Violence/ Social pregen dude, and really worked it.  <br/><br/>One problem that I'm really having with the system is, "What is a good mental challenge in Beast Hunters"?  If someone pointed a knife at me and said "Come up with a dozen physical or social challenges that can be engaging, and more than the same Offensive Action over and over again", I could do it for physical and social quickly, perhaps in 30 seconds.<br/><br/>But Mental? My mind draws a blank on the idea of fulfilling mental challenges. I'm looking for:<br/><br/>1) Ideas of mental challenges for Beast Hunters.<br/>2) Ideas of ways that "Mental Offensive Actions" can address them. By this I mean that usually a challenge takes at least 3-7 "rounds" of narration to get enough AP to make those good strikes. So I'm looking for some possible narrations that can lead up to that strike.<br/><br/>Example of Good Physical Challenge, but bad Physical Offensive Actions:<br/>Conflict: You are in a fight with a monstrous boar in a jungle.<br/>"I stab it with my spear"<br/>"I swing back, and stab it again with my spear"<br/>"I dodge, then stab it again"<br/>"I use my spear to stab it"<br/>"I stab at the boar while remembering that time, long ago, when I stabbed another boar with my spear"<br/>"I scream and stab it"<br/>"Stab stab stab stab stab"<br/>"Stabbity stab-stab-stab with a backflip and STAB. With my spear."<br/><br/>Example of Good Physical Challenge, with good Physical Offensive Actions:<br/>Conflict: You are in a fight with a monstrous boar in a jungle.<br/>"I run forward at it at a breakneck speed, leap, and stab it with my spear."<br/>"I somersault to the left, break into a sprint, and dive behind a huge stump, using it to give me an advantage for an additional attack later"<br/>"I run up a tree, spear in hand, carefully shimmy over to a branch, and get the drop on it"<br/>"I leap onto its back and ride it like a rodeo animal"<br/>etc<br/><br/>So, what I'm looking for is an example of a Good Mental Conflict, and at least Three Different Ways (like the "actual play quotes" above) that players could address/narrate a Mental Offensive Action for that conflict.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82971/#Comment_82971" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T12:10:08+00:00" title="July 24, 2007 12:10PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I make an attempt below, but the best I can make is a situation where you have to do some Thinking before you can do some Physical Actions.<br/><br/>Conflict: You are stuck in the center of an ancient, abandoned Aztec-style temple holding the Artifact you sought after in its bowels.

As a result, about because I picked the spirit warrior, I started narrating things like "I throw my spear into the hill, causing the spirits of earth to quake" or "I call upon Mother Rain to bring a deluge onto our foes!"<br/><br/>One of these, I think wasn't a bad mental action:  "The spirits of the dead warriors materialize behind me, causing my foes to tremble with fear."  Mental challenges feel like the staredown -- dramatically awesome in a movie, but in a game it could be lame to keep narrating "I stare him down!" over and over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83028/#Comment_83028" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T14:22:33+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  2:22PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have not yet played out a Mental Challenge in any of our BH games, but as soon as we do I'll chime in here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83047/#Comment_83047" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T14:46:43+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  2:46PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did this whole conflict with Hatehawks.

But I use mental challenges often as tests of willpower, too. Say the hunter needs to cross through a narrow canyon, with icy winds blowing at her. It's not a matter of physically making it through; it's a question of whether the hunter's drive and passions are strong enough to carry her forward. The maneuvers against the hunter are not just the cold, but all the temptations of a warm cave, the comfort of taking the long way around and being able to hunt down some food on the way, the sweet relief of giving up this particular venue.<br/><br/>And the hunter responds by focusing on all the things that drive her forward. She recalls the faces of her parents. She starts singing one of her tribe's ancient songs, straight into the face of the wind. She grabs the necklace of the rival she's out to kill so hard in her hands that blood starts dripping into the white snow-covered ground. And after a strong gust pushed her to her knees, she calls out her opposition:<br/><br/>"Hear me, spirit of this place, and know me.  I am Nioqhe of the Bherikal-nadan."  She raises herself up to one knee, stomping her foot into the ground. "Your treacherous path may take my footing."  She pushes herself up further, the wind tearing all around her.  "Your freezing breath may take my ears."  She marches forward, step by step, her teeth grinding and her eyes narrowed.  "But you will not take my revenge from me."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83506/#Comment_83506" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T13:36:38+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  1:36PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2007 1:36PM by johnzo.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For posterity, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3676&amp;page=1#Item_15" rel="nofollow">here's a mental challenge.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
