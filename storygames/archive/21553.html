I'm sure I'm not the first to wonder this:<br/><br/>Is it better to take your idea and write a book/novel/short story/long story than to try and write an rpg?<br/><br/>Better in the sense that it would be more productive and better served as one not the other.<br/><br/>I have ideas that may well be better as one not the other (whether they would succeed is entirely a different question). But as much as I like stories and fiction, there is something particular to rpg's that is more satisfying: you aren't just creting a single story, but a world that can be shared. As a creator that is something I would like to do a bit more than writing a story. <br/><br/>Unfortunately while neither are especially easy or quick to do (I mean in the professional-get-published sense, rather than homebrew for your own entertainment - which is perfectly fine), fiction is easier. This is because to publish an rpg you need to not just write the text, but lay it out, find art, find a way to at least print it electronically. None of those things are as important, if at all, with fiction. YOu don't playtest a novel; fiction doesn't require rules and dice.<br/><br/>If anyone else has considered this question for their own work, how (if) did they resolve it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471276/#Comment_471276" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-30T13:27:40+00:00" title="March 30, 2018  1:27PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done/am doing exactly that, and I'm sure others have as well. <br/><br/>You have great ideas about the game and wish that the story would unfold as your vision allows, but minor obstacles like the other players and rules get in the way. This is especially true if you are a storyteller gamer and many of the other players are not.<br/><br/>I have started novels/short stories for both my GURPS Saduria gameworld and around the character I developed for Trail of Cthulhu (a campaign that floundered mainly due to GM inexperience). My imagination was swirling with the ideas that I'd come up with in the initial creations but the chances of those ideas seeing the light of day in play were practically nil.<br/><br/>The solution is to give an outlet via creative writing. My stories are highly unlikely to become available to others and I would be amazed if anyone else found them interesting, but I am able to develop those ideas I had without needing to crowbar them into a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471278/#Comment_471278" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-30T15:23:03+00:00" title="March 30, 2018  3:23PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you have ideas that you think would be better in one form than the other, I would say to trust your writer-instincts and choose the mode that you feel best suits the idea. I think it's also worth noting that you don't necessarily have to sacrifice more literary inclinations even if you are "game writing"; the format is absolutely a fertile ground for experimental fiction, both in the sense of the incorporation of other fictional modes into game writing, and for treating game writing as a fictional mode or framework in itself (adventure/scenario/module writing in particular I feel doesn't get as much literary respect as it sometimes deserves).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471288/#Comment_471288" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-30T21:44:02+00:00" title="March 30, 2018  9:44PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want to control your stories, write a book.<br/><br/>If you want to lose personal control and share storytelling with a group of friends, play an RPG.<br/><br/>If you're a crazy person, write an RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471289/#Comment_471289" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-30T22:58:49+00:00" title="March 30, 2018 10:58PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with yukamichi, trust your instincts on how functional one choice would be over another. <br/><br/>However, If you purely thinking in terms of which one will reach a wider audience, or be more successful in terms of being published, I think that's the wrong way to approach it. <br/><br/>But also I don't see a reason you couldn't do both as well.

It just happens that a large portion of traditional RPG marketing is based on pretty pics rather than the text on its own merits.<br/>However, I don't believe either fiction or RPGs to be any harder than the other to market: both suffer from an overcrowding of offer compared to their existing audience, and the real breakthroughs in both fields - in terms of reception - are those titles which colonize new audiences. Also in both fields, great advancements of the art-form have often been driven by works which weren't individually very successful, in terms of reaching a large audience (often, in literature, this has proven temporary - as in posthumous fortune - something which RPGs as an art-form are still too young to have experienced).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471303/#Comment_471303" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-31T10:00:15+00:00" title="March 31, 2018 10:00AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf" rel="nofollow">AsIf</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you have a particular plot in mind, then it's probably a linear narrative (story, screenplay, what have you) rather than a game.

THe GURPS supplement (or whatever it was) came out later. I don't know if Martin was involved.<br/><br/>But the proiect never stemmed from a published original rpg, and had the books not been written then the aforementioned product wouldn't have either.<br/><br/>Same with the Expanse and, iirc, Malazan. Both came from extensive rpg campaigns that used previous systems or games. I don't know what games they used. The Expanse is now getting an rpg treatment, but that's not being writen by James SA Corey and wouldn't have existed had the books, and TV show, come out first and succesfully. <br/><br/>So I'm not proposing a choice between either running your story as an rpg and writing it as a novel. <br/><br/>Which is fine and good luck if you do that.<br/><br/>But between writing an rpg or writing a novel. So the rpg would be something in the vein of (looking at the top of my shelf) Coriolis. Not specifically, but as an example of an rpg with a dedicated specific and unique setting (as opposed to, for example, GURPS).<br/><br/>I hope that's clear                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471313/#Comment_471313" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-31T14:28:53+00:00" title="March 31, 2018  2:28PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Write a book because you want to raise some interesting questions... and then answer them yourself.<br/><br/>Make a game because you want to be involved in raising some interesting questions, but you want them to be answered by others.<br/><br/>However, I have to add:<br/><br/>I find this to be a very strange dilemma.<br/><br/>Why?

Art and layout aren't any more integral to RPGs than to fiction. <i>Reaching an audience</i> is the issue. It just happens that a large portion of traditional RPG marketing is based on pretty pics rather than the text on its own merits.<br/>However, I don't believe either fiction or RPGs to be any harder than the other to market: both suffer from an overcrowding of offer compared to their existing audience, and the real breakthroughs in both fields - in terms of reception - are those titles which colonize new audiences. Also in both fields, great advancements of the art-form have often been driven by works which weren't individually very successful, in terms of reaching a large audience (often, in literature, this has proven temporary - as in posthumous fortune - something which RPGs as an art-form are still too young to have experienced).</div></blockquote>\nGood advice, but I don't think I can agree that art and layout aren't more important. I say this because rpg books just contain more art and have greater layout issues (as they contain rules and technical info) than a novel. THere are of course exceptions, but I don't see myself writing that kind of book. I also don't see, but could be proven wrong, many rpg books being as popular if they were presented as mere text. Though the idea of a format similar to the size and shape of fiction books is appealing (it worked for the Dragon Warriors books back in the eighties, coming out of the Fighting Fantasy boom).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/emarsk" title="emarsk"><img alt="emarsk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/831/nTAGTUPOK6CW5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/emarsk">emarsk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471331/#Comment_471331" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-01T10:25:33+00:00" title="April  1, 2018 10:25AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Layout, presentation and visual appearance are very important for RPGs. Otherwise we'd read RPGs in epub format, instead of pdf; but we don't, right? Why?<br/><br/>I think that the fundamental reasons are two:<br/>1. An RPG text is structured: it contains rules, pieces of advice, examples, maybe some setting, playing material like PC sheets\u2026 A good visual layout should support this structure, helping the reader to memorise and navigate this sea of heterogeneous information.<br/>2. The more an RPG text tries to convey the tone and describe the setting, the more the rules exposition becomes confusing and hard to internalise - or risks to. Therefore an RPG text is usually focused on teaching the rules well, not describing the setting and the tone. The visual and art are important to fulfil - or supplement - that role.<br/><br/>Novels are almost always "just" a linear text with very little structure[*], so the layout can be really simple: you basically just need to separate the chapters and apply very basic formatting for paragraphs and dialogues. A novel text is also completely focused on describing a world and conveying a tone, so you don't want extra media for that[*]. (Art can actually spoil the experience if it conflicts with the reader's imagination.)<br/><br/>* For a notable exception on both points, read Ursula Le Guin's "Always Coming Home".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471332/#Comment_471332" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-01T11:27:56+00:00" title="April  1, 2018 11:27AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ghostwhistler, while it's true that "Wild Cards" didn't exist as a published game before the publication of the shared world anthology series, the anthology has its origins in George R.R.

Have been a lot longer since I've been RPG-ing.<br/><br/>I think if you have a story pre-planned, you should write it as a story rather than an RPG. An RPG is a tool to tell stories. In fact, I tend to playtest my RPG designs solo--using the rules to write short stories about the same group of characters. The stories themselves don't usually go anywhere, but they really help me see where the rough patches are in my rules.<br/><br/>I guess if you have a rough story in mind, solo-playing an RPG could help you flesh out the moment-to-moment action?<br/><br/>But RPGs should be systems for how characters interact with each other and the world. If you tie it more to an actual story, it may be a more experimental game or it may be more of an "adventure" <i>within</i> an RPG campaign.<br/><br/>Even then, adventures that have the story <i>too</i> tied down are hard to run at the table. (I know; I've run a total of 4 sessions, and each have had their own little disasters in them because I'm still learning how <i>not</i> to write a story for them!

You could create an adventure for an existing game system, or a custom campaign setting, or a rules hack, or a collection of NPCs, or a map \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t even get into whether you should write your fixed story as a book or a play or a short story or a podcast or something else.

I think I may have learned it from larp writing.<br/><br/>Another guideline for gming: If you have to stop your players from playing, you're doing it wrong.<br/><br/>There was one sessions where I wanted A Thing to happen. So I started making notes.<br/><br/>Hm, that would require this PC to do this amazingly stupid thing, and that PC to do this other dumb thing -- okay, so if I did X and Y...<br/><br/>But wait, then what if the PCs did this logical thing? Okay, how could I stop that?<br/><br/>Right, and if they did this other thing, how do I stop that?<br/><br/>Okay, at this point, I realized that I was trying to stop my players from, well, playing. Not cool. This was not a plot I could run. So, I started prepping a different plot.<br/><br/>Then, one of my players couldn't make the session. I looked at my notes, and said, "Hey, would you mind if I specified that your PC did [stupid thing] for [magical compulsion] reason winding up in this [damseled position] but winding up just fine once the others rescue you and it's the session after?"<br/><br/>Player: My character will be fine by the session after?<br/><br/>Me: Absolutely.<br/><br/>Player: Sure!<br/><br/>In other words, since the player was not making the session, I could use the PC as if she were an NPC so long as she went back to being a PC when the player returned. The set up happened off screen, the PCs found out what had happened, and the players got to do whatever the heck they wanted. But without that? I would not have run that plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471450/#Comment_471450" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-05T08:01:14+00:00" title="April  5, 2018  8:01AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not a counter argument, but an addendum to Lisa's post.<br/><br/>You can totally play in a particiationist way if everyone is okay with that. I did it and I think these were better than trying to trick players in an illusionist way. Also 'better' (more) than a backstory for a session, and also better than writing it down in a short story if you are not into creative writing.<br/><br/>I had an IMHO awesome vision and my players opted to make it true! They still retained a lot of freedom, but their question was not what to do but HOW to do it. It seems like it's not a big thing but players could totally change tones, themes and causes. If you know Swords Without Master you know what I mean. F.e. I knew I wanted them to kill the zombie king in a specific way and the player happily flashed out the hows and the whys!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
