First order of business - marrying the weak Outside Chief, His Nose Is Broken. She brings it up to her mom, She Jumps, who is Inside chief. No can do, she says, I've already found a match for you - the mysterious, handsome stranger, who is in reality the scary-ass monster Loon Man in disguise. <br/><br/>So a series of huge conflicts ensue, and they take their toll on She Changes Minds. No, she doesn't marry Loon Man. Yes, she marries His Nose Is Broken and becomes the shadow Outside Chief. Hooray! Victory! But the cost, oh, the cost - she racks up corruption by going Outside in the conflicts, she tells lies that destroy her mother's reputation and get a capable Inside chief banished, and best of all, she joins the Bone Society and rockets up to second rank, becoming a full-on witch in the process.<br/><br/>[Insert metal guitar solo here.]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284097/#Comment_284097" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T04:49:25+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  4:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2010 4:54AM by Teataine.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, that's hardcore.<br/><br/>We played a ton recently, but completely different games because our schedules are all over the place and we are trying to run something regardless of who's attending...so we have a game ready of almost any combination of players. It's confusing a bit but we've gamed more in the last month than in the previous six months. It has also been an opportunity to try many older systems we never got to try before. (Some of this is July, but whatever...)<br/><br/><b>Ghost/Echo</b>: We kick it off by establishing it's a classic Matrix-y cyberpunk setting. Pretty soon we start making up our own dangers, with shared narration, running with vanilla Otherkind dice and ignoring most of the structure of G/E (as little there is). Being chased by the police, the characters go into a nightclub, looking for a contact who might help them. A player picks up the dice and says: "...and the danger is, I don't find him fast enough." He rolls and gets the danger. I narrate the contact suddenly putting a gun to his spine and whispering in his ear: "I bet you wish you had found me first." Lots of laughs, good moment.<br/><br/><b>Pathfinder</b>: Our silly dungeonworld game. They fight off an invasion of lizardmen riding giant turtles, then follow their trail back to the lizardmen city, infiltrate a temple and stop the ressuection-in-progress of a lizardman demigod with laser eyes. Good pulpy fun. I bemoan the moments where the system doesn't support the action and mood.<br/><br/><b>Rogue Trader</b>: Trying this out for the first time, we made characters and fought against an Ork Freeboota ship, after some good rolls their morale fails and the Ork captain apparently catapults himself into space and self-destructs his ship. Next time we'll investigate a strong energy signature on one of the planets. I expect lots of sanity loss. I love the mood of the game. The system is also pretty ok.<br/><br/><b>Guts &amp; Glory</b>: Quick and dirty playtest for my quick and dirty WW2 skirmish game. Everything runs smoothly for the first mission. Then we try to stop an SS transport as two desperate commandos. We blow a bridge and try to machinegun the survivors from a belltower, but we have to retreat almost instantly as someone fires a panzerfaust at our position. We skirmish around the village for a bit until we both get a bullet between the eyes in rapid succession. The beauty of random dice rolls.<br/><br/><b>BattleTech</b>: As survivors of a failed mercenary mission we scrounge around on an enemy territory, infiltrate a base, sabotage equipment and topple a guard mech with a makeshift mine. Then we just fuck everything up and get out without a scratch.<br/><br/>Call or Trail of Cthulhu tonight I believe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284162/#Comment_284162" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T12:30:18+00:00" title="August  3, 2010 12:30PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sunday (uh.. yeah... that's July, but anyway) we played "Narrative Old-School" with <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://d101games.co.uk/books/wordplay/" rel="nofollow">Wordplay</a>- my cynical, world-weary dwarf wizard (senior sub-lecturer of the Imperial University of Magic) accompanied an impetuous noblewoman to recover a legendary sword from a border fort - encountering orcs, skeletons, and some (luckily easily banished) madness spirits. The combination of pick-your-own-traits-and-beliefs new school and walk-in-turn-left old school worked surprisingly well. I didn't even ever regret making my character's highest trait be Pompous (6d) - it seriously came in handy ordering our mercenaries around. Explaining to the other player's character why we needed a pole of <b>at least </b>9 feet 6 inches in length in order to explore any ruin was a particular highlight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284650/#Comment_284650" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T11:19:58+00:00" title="August  6, 2010 11:19AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - the Kingmaker Device gets the Disposition check and we wind up with a map where Ord, Garrick, and the Kingmaker are at one end and Stefos and two Cogsquads are at the other. I want to keep Disposition because it creates unexpected arrangements to interpret that are tactically relevant (the winners decided this shape so it's for a tactical purpose (outside the narrative) but needs explaining (inside the narrative) and this friction is awesome). We offer a sudden burst of activity at the Kingmaker and the explosion tears Stefos out of the guts of it hurling him a thousand meters away along with clusters of machinery that turn into mindless bad guys. That's cool. JB offers that the junk transforms to bad guys IN THE AIR and Stefos is fighting them as he is hurled distant. Bob reflexively announces how awesome that is (totally playing into Stefos as warrior son of a god, making him awesome) and takes a fate point from the pool and hands it to JB. This is not in the rules. It is now \u2014 this is a reflex that hints at a rule, the kind of play we've seen before.<br/><br/>- the fight proceeds. Ord and Garrick disrupt the Kingmaker with death magic and claws, though Ord's wings are broken in the process. Stefos calls upon his father (piety), God of Seas, to melt the snow around him and the fight proceeds underwater, with Stefos' new army of mermen (warfare). He's getting hurt alone here, though, and has two consequences before Garrick and blast the remaining cogsquads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284651/#Comment_284651" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T11:20:40+00:00" title="August  6, 2010 11:20AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Psi-Run with a Story Games Newbie (me) and three trad-players.<br/> There was not much "running", as only two locations were visited, but come and meet<br/><br/>A strange firebranded girl,  walking around with an obsidian knife, knowing she's constantly follwed by something!!!<br/><br/>An emaciated 50-year old man, with a scar over his left eye, communist and nazi symbols tattoed on his hands and a strange relationship with Wrath and Violence... he can control it in others, but the rage inside him keeps getting bigger and bigger!!! Also, he's got a keyring with infinite keys attached... why?!<br/><br/>A darkish guy with a huge tattoo, a power over shadows and a glowing Machete!!!<br/><br/>they are rapidly reached and attacked by their pursuer, a man in white with a burning green circle (which they instinctively know as "The Nethersun") floating above his head, and, after some collateral damage and two (TWO!!!) brainstorms, they manage to subdue him. Instead of running, the girl uses her knife to detach the burning circle from the man's soul, and puts it in the entity that was following her, which  turns out to be her familiar... she's the Chosen One of a dark covenant wishing to control the world, and she's about to gain absolute power... but the man with control over wrath pushes the third guy to interrupt the ritual!!!<br/><br/>In the end, it turns out that the third guy is a member of another cult, competitor to the girl's one, and that they both want to control the emaciated man, whose power was, supposedly, to absorb and metabolize the wrath in humans, with a cathartic effect:  the rage he constantly feels is due to the fact that he was tortured and broken, and so he was not able to purify the wrath he absorbed from outside anymore. The keys he held openend and close the doors to the inner worlds  living in every person,  and he had to protect them to ensure the proper balance of the spirit world. when the little girl, her familiar/source of power destroyed, managed to take the keys from him and sever his connection to them, he resorted to the only resource he had left: the pain he suffered in life and that shattered his ability to control wrath. he released it over the world, and every living being suffered in one moment all the pain of its entire life: grown-ups and old people died, and the remaining children had felt the pain in such a way, that they would never consider again to hurt one another. <br/><br/>I think the exxplanation is nebulous and not totally understandable, but the game was really great, and the ending was totally powerful. We sort of went astray, away from the "run for your life" theme of the game,to a full-fledged fight between the pcs, but  in the end everything wrapped up fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shadowmourne" title="Shadowmourne"><img alt="Shadowmourne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/130/nQVJZC4DDIYSK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shadowmourne">Shadowmourne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284824/#Comment_284824" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T09:28:48+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  9:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally got to play Apocalypse World - finally got the game on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a> off the ground.<br/><br/>My Hocus, Hope - a poor con-girl who less owns and is more owned by an evangelical, violent group of storm worshipping thugs - managed to shave off some of the oncoming storm to create a sort of Mindspout that flings our feelings right back at us.

The TV-crazed engineer Murphy and the priest He-Died-Upon-The-Cross-For-Thee Stonefield pitches the idea for one of the candidates that TV is a good propaganda tool and they will build cameras for him if they get some cash and a little screen time for preaching. Later Murphy persuades the candidate that nobody will watch preaching, if they show some good honest blood sport more will watch. When he gets access to the TV tower to get fresh tapes he broadcasts a tape of his own, stuff and snuff he had recorded from the channels between channels: horrible machinations of the Rust. He Hungers for anarchy and the primal state and with help from the Rust every TV in town becomes a device of the Rust but it works better than he expected and abominations start crawling out of the TVs. The priest smites some demons and a few TVs and lead his flock in exodus but just as they escape from the city Jerry Springer and a cozy sofa and spotlight is there trying to tempt his flock away from him.<br/><br/>The priest pushes with his life to lead his flock to a safe oasis and the crazed engineer lets his TV take a bullet before convincing the rich candidate that fiction is better than reality and they can be gods of creation if they accept that.

Cecille, seeing the kids go and witnessing the fall of her only other keystone in this world, takes her own life.

Joel contemplates using terror to intimidate his employer into giving them more information, but is advised against it. Since both Agents have only a 1 in Dig, They rent a jet plane, land on Parliament Hill during a press conference, and let the PM know he's in danger.<br/><br/>Bang. A shot rings out, and the PM is hit. A quick scan reveals a sniper in the bell tower, so Jonah's Agent Spike draws his guns and fires (Kill 5), while Joel (Bob Smith) calmly takes command and tries to save the PM (Cool 5).The sniper has eight dice.<br/>Round 1: 4x1, 2x3 against Bob Smith's 2x1 and Spike's 2x3, 2x1. Sniper is SHOT. The PM is still bleeding, on national TV.<br/>Round 2: Bob Smith switches to Take 2 (his combat action is to grab a walkie talkie); Spike gives him defensive fire (helping), and after burning some aspects still gets hit, so he is SHOT. There is some discussion about the implications of burning the aspect "thin black jeans", and it is explained that Bob Smith will still be wearing pants, he just can't tell a story with them to get two extra dice.<br/>Round 3. Spike is back to Kill, and he ends up getting three hits. Jonah describes the overkill with glee, as the body falls out of the bell tower, and is kept dancing by the impact of bullets (Jonah demonstrates by doing the robot). This is on national tv, but the agents walk away. Player Success, despite dead PM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285778/#Comment_285778" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T09:23:32+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  9:23AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a Hard Holder woman in Apocalypse World named Uncle who is pre-operative trangendered with a soft face, commanding eyes, and a fat body but I'm constantly working out, taking testosterone injections, and nervously smoking because 150 hungry, idle, and savage maniacs demanding I tell them what to do isn't as relaxing as I hoped. <br/><br/>We live in The Factory, an old fishery.

Sometimes a session fails, though, and the post-mortem (especially when playtesting) is the interesting AP.<br/><br/>"We had some trouble in this session and in post-game analysis we think that the duty system created a lot of internal planning that was in conflict with other players' planning. As none of it was announced aloud, this became friction at the table and play was slow and stilted. Also, Scopes were constructed without the intent to use them in narration, and so there was some awkward play towards fate points and so that needs to be addressed. Ideas include granting a starting fate point (for MYSELF) to reduce the tension of fatelessness, removing the implicit pacing of an IMPENDING CONFLICT, and changing who may give who fate points. Probably we will use all of these. For the last, letting anyone, including the acting player, hand fate points around for hitting a scope is probably a good idea. Keeps it casual but takes the self-reward guilt off."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286241/#Comment_286241" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T19:32:27+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  7:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2010 7:46PM by lordgoon.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A long ship-to-ship battle was in the offing during this week's session of our GURPS campaign, which is set in a fairly trad fantasy universe during the Age of Sail. Our Dwarven pirate assailants were few in number, but magically formidable. About halfway through the conflict, their Mage summoned an enormous fire elemental, and it looked as though we were all about to be roasted like a chicken.<br/><br/>But Chris' character, who'd done basically nothing all campaign but sit in his stateroom building explosives, walked up to the elemental and said "Yo."<br/><br/>"Where am I?" roared the creature. "What's happening?"<br/><br/>"Well, the little guys with beards over on that ship summoned you here. You're on the deck of a ship, dude, way out in the middle of an ocean."<br/><br/>"What? Really? The ocean?" said the elemental. "Well...<i>fuck them</i>!!" And it instantly incinerated our foes' ship, then disappeared in a puff of smoke, and a plot twist worthy of M. Night Shyamalan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286262/#Comment_286262" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T23:40:53+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 11:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my Sunday Apocalypse World game the players attempt to usurp the leadership of the wandering town of RoverVille (a small collection of RVs).

They live around a ford in an otherwise impassable river.  Every spring the river floods, bringing more debris for the piles of trash that are scavenged by the artists for materials, and by other locals for whatever they can find.  The local word for bartered goods is "junk", as in, "Give me my fucking junk back, asshole."  There's mutants living in the red sandstone caves, a biker gang somewhere over the horizon, and a bunch of mudfish that have suddenly turned poisonous.

She was responsible for the outbreak.  "Daddy!  Mittens died!  Bring her back!"</li>\n<li>A crooked and inept cop, Rob, with a penchant for running things down with his car (even before the zombies were prevalent)</li>\n<li>A "useless" IT guy Randy still living with his grandmother, who is introduced into the game as Mittens steals his beef jerky during an "all night raid."</li>\n<li>Mrs. Mansen, the IT guy's grandmother, who was mentally ill and doted on Randy, who we later find out was the nanny of Suzy's millionaire father.</li>\n<li>Liz, who has been "injured" at the beginning of the movie by Mittens, who is also the mayor's wife.</li>\n<li>Charles, a doctor at the local hospital, who is rooming with his buddy Randy, despite the crazy Mrs. Mansen.</li>\n</ul>\nHighlights are as follows:<br/>Suzy appearing at Liz's hospital bed, pointing  accusitively and saying "You're infected.  The doctor should burn you right away."<br/>After which Suzy is taken into custody somewhere in the hospital. Mittens escapes the next scene with Randy's beef jerky intent on delivering it to Suzy.<br/><br/>The news caster announcing a substantial reward of four million dollars for Mittens, and advising caution in her capture.  Cut to Suzy saying "she gets frightened easily when she's away from home" in her saccharin childish tone.<br/><br/>Charles, the doctor, discovering an anti-pathogen in his blood and cutting himself with arrows to get the stuff on the arrowheads.<br/><br/>Rob, following a bloody trail of footprints from a murder scene to a rundown apartment complex, and discovering Liz (the mayor's wife) having extramarital relations with Juan.  The conflict was over whether Rob takes her in, or she can bribe Rob off the trail.  The scene fades out before we can find out what Liz used to bribe him with.<br/><br/>Mrs. Mansen jumping in to stop Charles from skewering Suzy (now zombified.)  Later, Mrs. Mansen hits the sporting goods store and comes out swingin "like we did back in 'nam."   She is the first to "escape."  She does so by defeating a mutant confabulation consisting of six zombies in one big symbiotic mass.<br/><br/>Liz finally manages to "escape" when Juan finds her and leads her to a secret underground smuggling tunnel.  They abscond together into the night.<br/><br/>Rob and Randy are both taken out as a zombie attacks Rob during a drive-thru food run.  The zombies gained "new abilities" and formed a bike gang.  We see Rob's cruiser being driven by one of the zombie gang members, splattered with blood, but we never actually see Rob's corpse.<br/><br/>Randy almost bit it in an earlier scene when his grandmother (Mrs. Mansen) insisted he "say hi to Jenny from down the block.  Get her phone number.  Spending some time with a girl would do you some good."  Jenny is, of course, a zombie by now.<br/><br/>Only two, maybe three scenes didn't end up in some kind of conflict, so we paced rather fast.  All in all, good times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287672/#Comment_287672" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T16:38:37+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  4:38PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>Montsegur 1244 @ Dragonflight<br/><br/>Nice one, Johnzo.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nJohnzo also ran a great game of In A Wicked Age @ Dragonflight - one I don't think I'll ever forget.

Corba, for very complicated reasons, had stolen Phillipa's (my) newborn baby and was running towards the exits.  I had one scene card.  Ping had three.  I waited until I could bear no more, stole back control, and tried to get Phillipa clear of the scene with the baby.  Ping would not consent to that, stole the scene back, and the baby did not survive it.  It felt like a showdown between me and Ping, but a healthy one.   I'd already used my story control currency influencing other things, so I was content to let the cards fall where they may, and allow Ping the infanticide she was craving.<br/><br/>This was the meanest Montsegur I've played yet.  Poor soulful Bernard (Ben) was hired by Corba to spy on Escalarmonde (Kristian) who is becoming a woman on too accelerated a schedule...  Arsende (Susan) discovered that Raimonde (shared) gets paranoid when his pants are down, and winds up in the dungeon for her troubles -- and then the furious Corba stole the scene simply so she could go down and instruct the dungeonkeeper to torture Arsende.   Amiel (me) murdered Raimonde on PIerre Roger's (Susan's) orders.  In the wailing aftermath, Corba was put under house arrest.  Corba stole the baby and used it to parry Pierre Roger's sword when the lord turned matricidal.   Pierre Roger and Phillipa were half-siblings, and everyone -- especially Corba -- delighted in proclaiming this to the gay innocent Phillipa, who denied it every time.<br/><br/>But the true soul of the game was Bernard, the sad witness of all this saucy carnage.  He lost his nerve to follow Pierre Roger, he lost his nerve to fight, he tried to find solace in consolamentum, but he knew he wasn't destined for heaven and he lacked the courage to burn.  So he tried to recant, and the Inquisition recognized him, and burned him anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288009/#Comment_288009" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T06:34:53+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  6:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>This was the meanest Montsegur I'd played</blockquote>\nWow, you guys were a pack of bastards.

Last scene: She Changes Minds, He Loses Women and Pestilence Man walking off into the sunset of a still-drying new world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288640/#Comment_288640" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T04:30:28+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  4:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kick-started a new PTA series under our participation model.

The players were four absolute newcomers to role-playing, none of whom I knew particularly well nor had played anything like it.<br/><br/>It went <b>brilliantly.</b> I've run and played Lady Blackbird half a dozen times before, but never with an entire group of complete newbies... and they took to it like ducks to water. Steph, who played the titular Lady Blackbird, particularly got into her character. The only issue was that some of the players were not native speakers of English, and thus description did not flow quickly or naturally for them... but they still enjoyed the game thoroughly. Music was vital.<br/><br/>They brutally slaughtered the brig guards bypassed the ship's corridors by simply blowing a hole in the deck straight through to the Owl's hangar, and quickly escaped off into the wild blue yonder in under an hour. Along the way, there was a flashback to Lady Blackbird's meeting with a young Captain Cyrus Vance, where we established a long-standing attraction between the two, and Kale got <b>herself</b> into some pretty severe strife. In fact, she ended the session with the "Dead?" condition tagged after some failed ministration from Naomi.<br/><br/>John Harper, you are an amazing man.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289572/#Comment_289572" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T09:39:32+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  9:39AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an aerial battle between Ord the dragon, carrying his sorcerous and heroic allies, and chimpanzee-piloted airships with harpoon cannons and flying infantry with bamboo and leather and Levity-magic wings, Stefos the demi-god of the River is blown clear of Ord by a volley of harpoons that shatter against his shield.

I may have oversold the Reckless Breakage rule a bit to the players. (This is a rule where the player can gamble at breaking their weapon by rerolling a failed attack.) The Ardent\u2019s game went something like this:<br/><br/><b>Encounter 1:</b> Rolls reckless breakage on her metal spear. Breaks it. Fights with fists for a while, then picks up another metal spear from a dead Templar. Breaks it. She finds a obsidian spear after the fight.<br/><br/><b>RP scene:</b> \u201cMy daughter, as your Noble father, I cannot help you liberate the Brickyards. But take this: the magical metal Spear that is a metaphor for both our relationship and the fate of our Noble house.\u201d<br/><br/><b>Encounter 2:</b> (eh, blazing starfall + minions + strategery = let\u2019s skip this encounter)<br/><br/><b>Encounter 3:</b> Rolls reckless breakage on her ancestral metal spear. Breaks it. (Meanwhile, the Battlemind rolls Reckless Breakage for the first time and crits a templar. I imagine him basically pumping his weapon in the air like \u201cWHO\u2019S THE PSIONIC DEFENDER AND HAS FOUR ARMS? THIS GUY!\u201d)<br/><br/>The ardent would probably not be using Reckless Breakage for a long while, but her game was also a decent string of badassery. Did I mention the psionic punching because she broke her spear on someone\u2019s face? Yes.<br/><br/>(A repost from my blog; short and it fits so I hope it's acceptable.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289853/#Comment_289853" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T10:25:26+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 10:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World<br/><br/>My brainer Brace had sex with the group's savvyhead Gitch.

It was clear that a nameless evil in the New England town of Kugan's Rest meant harm to Blaine and Celia Peabody (of the Boston Peabodys). But they couldn't just leave - they were throwing a party in a fortnight and they'd already sent the invitations! <br/><br/>A cool game mechanic moment - Blaine is chopping at Celia Peabody (who is now possessed and basically the avatar of the Menace) with the 1-advantage-die sword that broke off the statue of Kugan in the town square;  and Smitty, who is played by a guy who I've played D&amp;D with for years and never before seen do anything but power-game - he says, "Don't hurt her!  It's Celia!"  So Blaine puts down the sword, and we just barely lose to the Menace - the last roll our one remaining character has 4 dice against the menace's 2, and we tie.  <br/><br/>Epilogue:  a fortnight later, some Bostonians show up at the deserted mansion on the edge of Kugan's Rest, "I dare say, where *are* Celia and Blaine?"<br/><br/>I was blown away that this game seemed to have brought out the real roleplayer in S.  Not just in purposely playing nonoptimally, he was also playing NPC's with different voices (his Nestor, the house caretaker, was awesome), and, well, kudos to Jonathan Walton.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290171/#Comment_290171" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T19:29:02+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  7:29PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lamentations of the Flame Princess: A giant bearded waterhorse smashes our boat to flinders, and we swear a blood oath to hunt it down and end it.

Our Gunlugger's often on the periphery of the action, which has been mostly social.  I prompt a meeting between him and an NPC.  It starts out well (mysterious summons, strange delicacy in the midst of squalor as Dog Head serves tea in porcelain cups at his junk shack in the dump), but then I find myself going out on an awkward, boring limb as Dog Head spouts some mumbo jumbo meant to point at a potential plot line.  Not AW-esque at all, as I start leading the player instead of following the character.  Fortunately, I had overrun the player a bit, and we decided to roll back the narative a little so his could do a read.  He failed miserably.  So the mumbo jumbo got replaced with, "You see a red dot appear on Dog Head's forehead.  What do you do?"  Gunfire ensues.  Much more satisfying.  Pity about the cups.
