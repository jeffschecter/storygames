Did her gift stick around after she'd done her part?<br/>- Boomer going from human-lover pre-New Caprica to Cavill's pet later.<br/><br/>I've never roleplayed a character already well-defined in fiction, so I might shy away from Helo or Boomer.

The system seems to work fine, but the game itself is challenging for players used to being part of a cooperative party, so we're still working out the kinks at the player level.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe set the game in a totally different refugee fleet, based around a battlestar (<i>Actaeon</i>) that was still fitting out before Fleet acceptance trials, and that the Cylons had therefore expected to be able to destroy while it was still in spacedock. Instead, the Commander ordered the crew to use demolition charges to blow the ship free of its moorings, and things got off to a rocking start. Now we have an incipient civil war over the rights of "Cylon clones," who are of course skin jobs who insist they were actually victims of Cylon scientific research.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209554/#Comment_209554" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T09:39:22+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  9:39AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started working on a homebrew system for play that felt like the new BSG series a little while ago.

I've played it seven times now (never been a Cylon, though!).<br/><br/>In a BSG story game I'd want to include some possibility of PCs being Cylons, and that pretty much means that I'd need to ditch the canon storyline. As described above, keep the miniseries and/or first episode and then forge a new path from there. It would be interesting to have a list of activities or events that would cause players to accrue secret "Cylon points", which the GM rolls against at the climax of each session to determine if a given player was a Cylon all this time.<br/><br/>For example, a critical failure on a given skill check could be simple bad luck... or it could be subconscious sabotage by a Cylon sleeper agent. Any time you roll a critical failure, you get one Cylon point.<br/><br/>Players would be aware of the kind of things that cause Cylon points to accrue (part of the fun is the paranoia and second-guessing) but they would not be permitted to keep an actual record.<br/><br/>Just before the climactic scene of each session, the GM checks each player to determine if they're a Cylon sleeper. Each player receives a note (saying either "Cylon!" or "Not A Cylon!"). I'd do all of this towards the end of the session so as to increase the possibilities for cliffhangers and sudden betrayals. Ideally there would be some kind of passions/aspects mechanics involved in the game - something that will strongly motivate Cylon players to promote The Plan, but still allow for the possibility of sympathisers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210022/#Comment_210022" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T09:46:19+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  9:46AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>at the beginning you draw cards to (secretly) find out if you are a human or a Cylon, but then halfway through the game you all draw cards again, so some of you might be Cylons and never realize til the game is almost over!</blockquote>Yet-another Werewolf/Mafia clone, with a twist. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210024/#Comment_210024" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T10:00:55+00:00" title="June  2, 2009 10:00AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: simjames</cite>Just before the climactic scene of each session, the GM checks each player to determine if they're a Cylon sleeper.</blockquote>And, of course, if the PC dies! *gasp* "And you wake up in the resurrection ship!" After all, that's the only really meaningful (physiological) distinction between a "skin job" and a normal human: the former are immortal. Gotta play the mortality angle up, some.<br/><br/>And the system ought to have a variety of means of reveal, both to the player of the (now) Cylon and to the rest of the playing group. Consider all the ways they find out about a Cylon in the series:<br/>* Boomer is caught committing sabotage (IIRC).<br/>* The music draws together four of the the Final Five.<br/>* The Fifth just walks onto the scene, to the shock and chagrin of Saul et al.<br/><br/>That leads me to think of at least two ways to reveal to the player of the Cylon:<br/>* In a "weird scene" moment.<br/>* At death.<br/>* Passing a note.<br/><br/>...and all sorts of ways to reveal to the remaining players. BUT... now that I consider it, I don't think trying to keep it secret from the players will work, totally. Play by post or IRS or similar, sure. But I find it a real bitch to keep whispering scenes or taking folks aside to keep a secret. Further, you'd have to do it for EVERYONE playing, else the secret is revealed by exception. Finally, let's be real: most folks with whom we regularly game couldn't hide being a Cylon from us, once they read the card. I can often spot total strangers as Werewolves, when I watch them first check their card in Mafia/Werewolf.<br/><br/>So why not go ahead and keep it open, then, once revealed, and avoid a ton of handling problems? In fact, you'd still get paranoia--even more, actually!--if the GM is testing for Cylon-ness EVERY time someone fails a roll. Heck, players would even wonder if their character was a Cylon or not, until a Big Reveal! Just takes some play balancing, to make sure not EVERY player becomes a Cylon (maybe do a Final Five thing--only 1/3 or so of the players can ever convert, then the GM's just faking the roll).<br/><br/>OK, just brainstorming, now. It's an interesting conceit, though: basically a form of Mafia with a way to be "corrupted" while going about otherwise normal (for BSG) day-to-day shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210030/#Comment_210030" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T10:26:28+00:00" title="June  2, 2009 10:26AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure you could do a BSG "mini-series" ala <i>Razor</i> with <i>The Mountain Witch</i>...
