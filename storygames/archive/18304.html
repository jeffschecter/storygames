The basic system sounded like a good idea on paper, but in playtest it turned out to be too difficult to set stakes that could actually work within the system.  I <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2012/06/house-of-masks-new-playtest-version/" rel="nofollow">revised the game</a> to make it playable, by completely removing the core mechanic and replacing it with something else entirely.  But it still has a limitation of requiring exactly six players to play.  This strict limit on players has made it difficult for me to get in more than one or two playtests.<br/><br/>I put a lot of thought and effort into <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2011/08/437/" rel="nofollow">Death Takes a Holiday</a>, but in the couple of playtests, it turned out that there was no incentive for players to edit others player's statements.

It tells cool stories about ghosts and monsters and people whose lives are in danger, but it never evokes a sense of dread or fear in the players themselves.  <br/><br/></blockquote>\nLooking at Nameless Horror, I can certainly understand why it's "not scary". The rules are all there for telling cool stories but there is nothing in the rules that mechanically inch people close to danger or death, so there's really no sense of dread.<br/><br/>I can't help but think that you need to add something like this:<br/><br/>On a series of index cards, write a different number of each, 10 through 20 (the numbers are kind of arbitrary, but you get the idea). fold the index cards to hide the value, and each player draws an index card. This is the player's DOOM number. The player is never, ever allowed to look at the doom number they own, unless the value crosses below zero (at which point it will become revealed).<br/><br/>When a player asks the two other players to interpret the tarot cards, they each roll a dice, in secret from the rest of the table, which is kept under a cup. <br/><br/>When a player selects an interpretation, the player hands over his folded index card to the interpretor, who reveals his die roll. The Interpretor subtracts the die roll from the player's doom number, and makes a note of the player's new doom number on the card. Again, the player never sees his doom number (but all of the other players will know what it is to some extent)...he just knows how much it has been reduced at each stage.<br/><br/>If the interpretor reduces the number to below zero, he reveals the index card.  The interpretor now takes full control of the scene, describing VERY VERY BAD THINGS that happen to the player's character. The tarot card interpretation can be ignored, or modified.<br/><br/>If an interpretor kills off a player, he gains doom points based on the inverse of the value of the dying player's doom number. The player that had just died will mark this adjustment on the interpretor's card.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412644/#Comment_412644" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T07:09:37+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  7:09AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds a little bit fiddly.

I started to rewrite Death Takes a Holiday (whose system never satisfied).  And so I'm rewriting it to work with the same core mechanic as the Nameless Horror game (whose mechanics were solid but not right for the horror genre).

Our poor GM had to went trough double of the prep work to have his NPCs make a stand against our almost all-mighty PCs. Though it was the campaign our group remembers with the fondest memories. Now after three different versions on the Anima Hack I'm making a fourth that brings back some of these abilities in a more balanced and simple core system. And then added some Tenra Bansho hacks as well. Sorry Andy, I couldn't help it, I'm a compulsive hacker...<br/><br/>I also turned a hack of the whimsy cards into a really simple and frantic story-telling game. Still it isn't exactly what I'm looking for (a really simple GMless RPG that can be played right out of the box and gives newbies the skills needed for GMing more trad games) but it's a nice step towards that direction. Mostly the problem is that the players might go into competitive mode and ruin the story-telling atmosphere I intended to give.

Sort of Microscope-y, actually, but before that and very focused on emulating this one arc. I'd played a lot of In A Wicked Age and saw the strength of using lists to provide both content and context. So I banged away at it and it was always boring and never worked, but the lists for this town were cool and coincided with my emerging interest in a game with Fiasco's parameters, so I re-purposed the technology.

I had a neat thing where - whenever a PC acted 'freaky' - they could buy the silence of witnesses by giving them a string, but if the number of strings built up to a certain level, the witness would expose the PC unless they were 'dealt' with (hopefully leading the PC to commit more 'freaky' acts and so cause a downward spiral).<br/><br/>Trouble was, it took one of the coolest things about Monsterhearts (acting like a monster) and then punished you for it. So the game would turn into the MC trying to push the PCs to use their skin moves, but the players refusing to do so because it would get them into more trouble down the line (which flies in the face of the basic MC principles).<br/><br/>PCs trying to deny, hide, suppress their monstrous side was the right vibe, but they needed to be motivated to engage with the mechanic of showing their monstrous side and buying people off with strings as opposed to their best tactical course of action to be refuse to show their monstrous side at all. There needed to be a bigger advantage to using their monstrous side so the game could be about using it, but managing the consequences, rather than just not using it at all.<br/><br/>So, basically, nice little mechanic, but it demotivated the players from actually using it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MrPurple" title="MrPurple"><img alt="MrPurple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MrPurple">MrPurple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412980/#Comment_412980" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T16:58:16+00:00" title="April 28, 2013  4:58PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of little drafts I make fail due to lack of interested players, so I don't have a lot of stories of this type. The ones I've actually got to try I tend to play loose with the rules anyway! I've had things where <em> some </em> things haven't worked out, though.<br/>One was trying too hard to set up player conflicts as a primary source of drama, when one player didn't run with it, the other couldn't meaningfully explore their agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
