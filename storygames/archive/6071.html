But, in my experience, Game Chef and the Forge Birthday Forum were the only times all year that I felt connected to the other people on the Forge.  Most of us had never participated in the Forge Booth at GenCon, most of us had never played games together.  And we didn't realize that those were what tied all the "old timers" together, that's why they were better connected with each other than they were with us, because they had sold and played games together. So when Game Chef and, later, Story Games started, we went there because that's where the community was for us.  I wasn't getting that spirit of mutualism at the Forge on a daily basis, but, for me at least, I was getting it at Game Chef and, in the beginning at least, here at Story Games.  Now I get it more from Story Game Boston and the people I talk to regularly over chat and in person.<br/><br/>That's what happened to the mutualism for me: I was always following it, going wherever I found it most strongly.  And that often meant that I was heading away from one knot of roleplayers and towards another (or trying to form another, as in SGBoston's case).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135655/#Comment_135655" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T08:03:44+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  8:03AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.

There was a palpable disappointment felt when the humanity (naturally occuring differences in personality) were revealed, and it was especially easy for some of us in the community to make villians of the old guard, with Dogs and BW being the new AD&amp;D.

I'm just not. What history I have with it is spotty at best, and the way things have worked there has had virtually no direct bearing on me. It's had plenty of indirect bearing, since I use the Forge booth and it impacted a lot of people who are important to me, but one way or another, I am a step removed from that.<br/><br/>So, purely on that point alone, this was very useful to me to improve my understanding of how that idea of community existed from its own perspective.  This is kind of a big deal to me, since Fred and I have been pretty successful, and we view ourselves as part of the community, and we try to bust our humps to give back and be supportive, but we do not do it in the same way it was done on the Forge, or view it through the same lens that the forge seems to.  In an of itself that's not a bad thing. It's a good kind of diversity, and it should be awesome, but sometimes it's not.  I worry sometimes about the timing of our success, how it coincided with events surrounding the booths and I sometimes feel like Charlton Heston by the statue of liberty - "We did it! We killed Mutualism!"<br/><br/>And I know that's crap. Mutualism is alive and well. Different, but alive and well.  I know that our success came in the footsteps of the success of Dogs and BE and other games, and I know that we're not pushing them out as we come up.  Intellectually, I totally get that.<br/><br/>But in my gut? Man, sometimes I wonder. Not whether it's true, but if those feeling are out there. And I sometimes really think they are, and it bugs the hell out of me.<br/><br/>All of which is to say, it's always useful to me to be able to boil back down to the sources on things I don't have direct visibility into, and which can generate mirages at a distance, and that era of the forge? Definitely one of them.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135688/#Comment_135688" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T10:32:13+00:00" title="March 20, 2008 10:32AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

I read a lot of game stuff out online; like, this insane amount.  And about a week after reading something, I realise I haven't said a damn thing about it - to someone that probably really would have wanted to hear it, even if it's mediocre / lukewarm.<br/><br/>When I'm being <i>lazy</i>, I ask if I've put as much feedback and playtest and such stuff "in" as I've gotten out, and get back a "sure".  Now, though, actually thinking about it, the people and places I get stuff out and put effort back in are so very radically different as to make almost no sense.  As an example: <i>I've recieved feedback a few times from Mike Holmes, and that has always juiced me up to help others, so I throw that effort back out - but might, for example, throw it straight at something I got sent from an RPGnetter.</i> <br/><br/>And all that?  Does weird things to the idea of a community of feedback.  Which I'm now thinking about.<br/><br/>In my case, I know that some of this comes from my standing off from the Forge, and I hate that.  Because almost every time I go Forgeside, I make a twit of myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135722/#Comment_135722" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T14:20:55+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  2:20PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2008 2:21PM by lachek.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can sympathize with the people who were disheartened, rather than encouraged, by Burning Empires. I could even feel a tinge of sympathy for a total ass such as Vincent Baker, but apparently game designing gave him more money than God, so, you know, go fuck yourself, no sympathy here.<br/><br/>But yeah, it's intimidating. A fat high production value book based on a real license, written by this one guy who then goes on to win an Origin's Award. How could anyone hope to just pop up and compete with that?<br/><br/>Or for that matter, Rob and Fred, Spirit of the Century.<br/><br/>But these works do, when you think about it, serve well to define a target for independently published games to aspire to. As long as 600-page full colour monstrosities are not the norm, there's still a considerable space for less accomplished designers with good ideas to play in.<br/><br/>So there are a few things I would urge "the community" to do, to keep the spirit of mutualism alive and well in face of these great achievements in indie publishing.\n<ul>\n<li>Don't design in a vacuum. Embrace open design. Take care to read and reply to comments about your design.</li>\n<li>If you have a tendency to release fully formed platonic ideal beauties that go on to become hugely popular, consider releasing smaller works now and then. Concept games, mini-games, ashcan editions of ideas you're considering developing further. Just to show that you are, in fact, human.</li>\n<li>Include plenty of poorly-concealed theory and design notes in your games, or if that irks you, on a web resource your game links to. Even if you can't actively help others on design matters, you do us all a great service by allowing us an occasional glimpse of the genius behind your work.</li>\n<li>Start (or continue) using transparent, conversational language in your texts. It makes it easier for us to understand your game and the design decisions that went into it, and it also allows us to identify with you. This increases our courage when it comes to actually publishing something.</li>\n<li>Spend as much time and effort on community communication as you are willing and able - public forums and podcasts are what keeps us together, not solitary blogs (which are great in other ways).</li>\n</ul>\nAs many others in this thread, I don't think there really is a problem right now, but cliques tend to get tighter as they grow older. The more public communication we can get the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135735/#Comment_135735" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T14:53:37+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  2:53PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait...<br/><br/>There's some dissatisfaction within the indie design community that one of its members designed something that's <i>too good</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135738/#Comment_135738" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T15:05:28+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  3:05PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's eerily like those old sci-fi fandom woes of the 50s, 60s and 70s I've sometimes read.

We talk to each other because talking with each other often helps ourselves. I'm not here to make friends or whatever, though it's possible to do so and it might happen, it's not my goal in posting.

And also their expectations for having helped or been helped. I admit, there's not much distinction if you ignore those parts (I say with a slight jab).

These same people also repeatedly tricked me into writing a game, and tell me how to make it "better" even when I argue till I'm blue in the face with you, Mike.  Then, if they do happen to be right about something in my design that I didn't see, they lord it over me by telling me to "keep it up" and that my game is going to "be awesome."  A guy can only take that kind of thing for so long.<br><br>In fact, some of the people here have gotten it into their heads that it's OK to expose me to blogs and podcasts that I'd never have otherwise concerned myself with, thank you very much.  And then you go to the blogs and podcasts and they're like "hey, here's fifteen brilliant ideas in one interview."   As if I needed brilliant ideas.  Of course, now this means I've been suckered into listening to podcasts at work and you know what that means - so much for trying to be the first office worker killed by self-inflicted stapler wounds.  Jerks.  <br><br>Goddamn.  I almost forgot the ones that played games with me.  Some of these "people" have actually gotten me to momentarily break a perfectly stable hermitude - in fact, a few have even had the nerve to play with me in person, which everybody knows disrupts my catatonic grit-eating schedule.  <br><br>So if there's any mutualism in this community, I sure as hell can't find it for all the rabid selfishness.  So I'm going to try responding in kind, and if that means you end up the same way, well, you started it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135761/#Comment_135761" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T19:11:04+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  7:11PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Wait...<br><br>There's some dissatisfaction within the indie design community that one of its members designed something that's<i>too good</i>?</br></br></blockquote>\nYes. Although instead of calling it dissatisfaction, I'd call it intimidation. As it happens, I started reading through Burning Empires again a few nights ago, and man, there's some intimidating game in there. Yes, it's inspiring and wonderful and makes me think about how far I could take my own ideas, but <em>I am not there yet</em>. There are significantly less-polished books out there that I can still pull inspiration from, but feel more like something I could do as a first product.<br><br>I think part of it is that the production quality, which is beautiful, is similar to fully commercial books like D&amp;D core books, and, by extension, Fantasy Heartbreakers. When people say, "we don't want to go there," with respects to Burning Empires, I think that's the "there" there. Its the worry that competing with BE might lead a designer to spend more on a first book than they should.<br><br>Now the reality of this threat is probably close to nil, but given the context, I can understand how it might provoke suspicion.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135762/#Comment_135762" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T19:28:19+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  7:28PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I wanted to write a game now, I'd be scared too when looking at BE.

For Luke and the guys. I held it in my hands at Gencon that year and  I thought "This is what Luke wanted to make, and he totally made it." It wasn't about production values, page count, color, size or anything else. It was about Luke making the game he wanted to make. I was very, very happy for him. when I did eventually get a copy of the book later that year, I spent a lot of time pouring over it and appreciating it as a physical artifact. Because it deserves to be appreciated as one, and because that's something I go for. It is, as far as I can tell, a great game (still haven't played it, or I'll be totally honest, read the entirety of it). It's also an excellent artifact. A game doesn't NEED to be both, and certainly isn't required to be both. But Luke obviously wanted BE to be both. And I think he succeeded. And I'm glad he did. And I don't feel like that effects my games negatively at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135782/#Comment_135782" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T03:35:19+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  3:35AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Preamble: 'm afraid that I'll pass for a rude jerk, but bear with me and my not-complete understanding of the rudeness levels of another language.)<br/><br/>Basically, spoken like someone who is pretty much an outsider of all these communities (more or less), and as such observing from an external standpoint... I think all this "Mutualism is dead" talk is bull.<br/><br/>The Forge grew, The Forge became too big, people went and built other hubs. Story Games, the Design Collective, the Ashcan Front, whatever. <br/><br/>Mutualism is still there, alive and kicking.<br/><br/>It's just that Vincent seems to have much less time, now, and conversely there are too many places to read and follow and participate in, and as such tends to perceive it less.<br/> (Vincent, if I got this completely wrong, sorry, feel free to point it to me and call me names <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/><br/>About the Burning Empires "scare"... I can understand the gut feeling Vincent had but... nobody needs to put out games like BE to be successful. <br/>Quite the contrary, a huge fullcolor (pricy) book like BE has turned off more than one (and I'm sure Luke knows). <br/><br/>Small, well done games still sell, and I don't know anybody who thinks that they are "less than state of the art finished" because they are not color glossy manuals... am I wrong? Is there someone here who considers that kind of production values <em>necesssary</em>? Desirable, yes. Admirable, yes (heck, from what I've seen online it looks gorgeous).

He spent months putting the visual package together all by himself! Pick up Burning Empires, flip through it, imagine all the art except the icons, symbols, and spot illustrations (weapon examples) were removed. That's a lot of art gone. Burning Empires, license or no license, money or no money, would still be a gorgeous book. All crafted by Luke's own hand. And it's not visual masturbation. It's not frivolous. It's as functional as Vincent's writing in Dogs. The colors, tabs, icons, and layout guide you through the book, and inform you how to use it. The textures are evocative of the content and feelings the source materials seeks to inspire. The spot illustrations provide wonderful contextual examples. The charts are beautifully and efficiently organized for quick reference. The play sheets, relationship maps, conflict charts, world maps, visual scene session breakdowns, visual campaign arc breakdowns are all brilliant. And have very little to do with the art and licensed material. It's mostly Luke's skill and hard work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd love to add that Luke is also an incredibly giving and unselfish person. Many popular indie games credit Luke going out of his way to help them with their layout or giving advice or production tips. Luke is constantly giving back. Not only is he highly talented but he also shares those talents with others!<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn't part of indie doing as much as you can yourself? Well Luke is bringing it! Other indie designers are wonderful illustrators. Shouldn't they bring bare their talents? What about Vincent's writing? Many people would love to have Vincent's skills. Don't hate on Luke because he's an artist outside of the gaming world. And please don't insult art in general by downplaying it as useless (absolutely necessary to play, no, can be incredibly useful to use, yes).<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting that all aside, I probably go to a con at least once every 1-2 months. In person, I was pretty dismayed by the negative comments levied towards Burning Empires by other designers. People who are part of a community Luke has given freely much of his time and money to help out with no direct benefit to himself. Want to criticize the content and mechanics? Please do! It will only make the community stronger to know what works, what doesn't, and in what context. But most people who spoke to me about it didn't even read the book!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Burning Empires is not a game for everyone. It may not even be a game for most people here. It's a big book (not as big as it seems, it's less than 300 pages converted to a standard sized RPG book and a huge amount of those pages are taken up by charts and lists that you don't have to read). It's a tactical and competitive game. It's crunchy. It's not a "sit down, ignore the rules and just read for the setting" book. It's difficult to hack. And it's a long game meant to be played over many sessions. Nothing is wrong with liking or not liking any of these aspects. It's all personal taste. But none of that speaks to the quality of the game mechanics and procedures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game mechanics and procedures are brilliant. Not for everyone. But still brilliant. It's frustrating that the game is often written off as pretty or heavy and not much else. You could take the system, break it into 5 different parts and each of those parts would be amazing games on their own. There are a lot of amazing ideas in there. In the last year, I've been a part of many online and offline conversations discussing game design techniques and experimental ideas to try out. And often, ideas are brought up that are currently implemented in Burning Empires which surprises many people. There is a lot in there. Setting and situation created together by all the players at the table. Player flags. Dispersed and shared GM responsibilities. Playsheets of all sorts. Beyond character creation, procedures for running the game with no to little prep. Combat rules that scale from one on one, skirmishes, mass combat, to wars between worlds! Systems for political and psychological warfare. Rules for generating technology and powers on the fly. It breaks away from the conflict, conflict, conflict style play and actually does a good job emulating the story arcs and pacing of a comic book. There are free form scenes, flashbacks, flashforwards, scenes where players generate story content, and full blown conflicts. You can even play Burning Empires as a romance soap opera or political intrigue game, with rules and procedures to back you up. It's versatile. Not for everyone. But damn, this game is way more than just a pretty exterior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of, "how can I compete with Burning Empires?" Why would you? It's not a measuring stick. And customers have wildly different preferences and nuanced reasons for buying or not buying any given game. Dogs sells incredibly well and it's a small book with almost no art in it. Personally, I don't care about page count. In fact, I prefer smaller books that bring more fun. Because if a book can deliver me as much fun as any other game, with a smaller page count... that means I can read it quicker and get playing faster. That's a pretty damn good reason for me to buy! Now a days, instead of flipping through a book to look at the art, chapter list or play examples before I buy, I go straight to the credits page and look to see if playtesters are listed and how many. If the list is small or non existent, I usually put the book down.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135803/#Comment_135803" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T08:19:49+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  8:19AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mutualism is both dead and alive, but you won't know until you open the box.<br><br>The cat, however, is totally dead.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135814/#Comment_135814" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T08:50:58+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  8:50AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2008 9:28AM by David Artman.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's "dead," per se.

Incidently, for those who perceive themselves as newcomers, <a href="http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Socratic Design</a> is back for a new round articles.  I welcome all questions and petitions for help.  Back to that quote.  There are some key things that Luke and Vincent said that apply here.  1) Do what you gotta do.  If you have a game and you really want to publish it, do it!  Don't worry about writing the next DitV, Mountain Witch, or SotC.  It's totally irrelevant.  2) If you want mutualism (and if you're like me, you definately do), you have to make it happen for yourself.  Buy someone else's game.  Play it.  Talk about it.  Then tell them about your game.  That's your end of the bargain.  Hold that up and see what the othe guy does.  3) Everyone's experience will be different.  Vincent's was different from Lukes and Clyde's was different from both of them.  And they are all different from mine.  So if your experience with the community doesn't appear to be the same to you as say... Jason's Morningstar's experience is, that's okay.  (Jason I used you cause I regard you as a friend and a mentor)  There's no template to trace.  Work to find a way that suits your wonderful individuality and go with that.  That how, IMHO, you'll be most successful and most satisfied.  4) Fuck the money.  Charge what you want for your game.  The market will tell you if that's fair or not.  And don't compare yourself to others.  If you <b>have</b> to use a standard, use this one: "Did I break even on my project?"<br/><br/>To luke and Vincent.  Thanks for sharing guys.  I really appreciate you opening up to everyone like that.  I hope to get to see you guys again in real life soon.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135851/#Comment_135851" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T13:46:07+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  1:46PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "If you want a picture of the future of gaming, imagine my boot stamping on a the Group Omega face . . . for ever"<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135864/#Comment_135864" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T15:47:23+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  3:47PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I can sympathize with the people who were disheartened, rather than encouraged, by Burning Empires.

You produced a game that is <i>really</i> awesome, be proud.<br/><br/>At least, that's where I'm coming from here, when I say I'd be scared shitless of BE. I'm not saying "What a bad game or what a bad designer", quite to the contrary.

As noted, BE would have been a gorgeous book without the art, but access to the art assets of the comic allowed him to be absolutely _luxurious_  with the art, and that's awesome.  And if Luke were the only person who was ever going going to be in a position to have that kind of resource then sure, I might see shaking a tiny fist.  But the reality is that the net is allowing more artists to thrive and more projects to grow.  If the idea of making an RPG about a webcomic or comic or program that you love is something that appeals to you, it is getting more and more likely that you can _do_ that if you really want to throw yourself into it.<br/><br/>And when that day comes, and you've got a pile of art stacked high and you are staring at it wondering how you are going to make a book that does _justice_ to all this awesome stuff you have been entrusted with, Luke is the guy who's going to be there and be able to say "This is what I learned form this, this is what worked for me, let's make yours even _more_ awesome."<br/><br/>So, I dig it that people don't have their heads all the way around BE at this point. No one else among us has done anything like it. <b>Yet</b>.  But we will.  Not all of us.  Some of us don't want to do that, and that's entirely fine, but those of us who look at it and think  that they couldn't are selling themselves short, or they somehow imagine that they, personally, must make this whole thing happen.  And heck, i can see why they might think that. There's a lot of DIY in game design, and if you have an idea you can often learn enough to put out a pretty good looking book.  That's admirable and fun, and no, it's not how you end up with Burning Empires.  That is Luke's baby, no question, but his are not the only hands that touched it. <br/><br/>And here's where we get to the mutualism that excites me.  As a community, we're beginning to recognize that we have different strengths and capabilities, and that while one person might have a really strong game, they're not necessarily going to be able to bring the same strength to editing, layout, playtesting or marketing, and that there are people in the community that they can lean on for those strengths without making their game into something which is somehow less theirs.<br/><br/>Now, again, we have different priorities.  Some of us don't want sales to impact our game design process at all. Some of us feel that owning the process from beginning to end gives them what they need.  Some of us could have a free pass to have their game come out looking like BE and would take a pass.  And that is totally fine. Even more, if those are your priorities, then the very existence of BE shouldn't even move the needle.<br/><br/>And even saying all that, I have some fear of BE, and a product that looks that good, but I think it's a different fear.  I fear that if I ever made a product that looked that good that it would be shining a god-damned spotlight on my game, on every nook and cranny and asking "Is my game good enough to look this good?"  and it would probably turn me into a nervous wreck.  When you make that big a promise with the wrapper, the candy inside better be delicious.  BE pulls this off, and I commend the game for that, but even more I commend Luke for explicitly taking this work of love and putting it out there in the position of highest risk, where it will suffer attacks from all sides.<br/><br/>I have no way to look at that and _not_ be inspired to make my own game better. Simple as that.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136096/#Comment_136096" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T07:56:27+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  7:56AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lukzu</cite>This is it. This is what kills me: "Intimidating," "Compete," "Less accomplished designers." Even in jest, there's a clues to the roots of these misconceptions.<br/><br/>It's not a competition. I'm not trying to scare anyone. I produced a game to exorcise my demons<i>just like Vincent did with Dogs</i>. More than that, I'm just like the rest of you: I'm like everyone who's published a game -- no worse, no better -- but I'm even more like<i>everyone who hasn't published a game but wants to.</i>I remember what it was like before I put a game out and I still go through all the same bullshit now as I did then. Putting me or what I do in any other category than that is putting yourself down. Anyone can do what I did.<i>That was the fucking point of producing Burning Empires.</i>It wasn't a fuck YOU, it was a fuck THEM.</blockquote>\nLuke - none of those things were said in jest. And they're not misconceptions. Let me explain.<br/><br/>It <b>is</b> a competition. I will read you favourably and interpret your incredulity as an honest misunderstanding. An unfavourable read of that passage, written by you, could easily be likened to some pretty high school girl claiming "it's not a beauty pageant" while carefully doing her makeup in front of her less attractive peers.<br/><br/>It's a competition because the first question every Forge post receives is "Why should I play your game over X?"<br/>It's a competition because critique from the community is all based on the quality of what is already out there.<br/>It's a competition because the crowd our games cater to tend to be far more critical than the crowd who buys every d20 supplement that gets released.<br/>It's a competition because games like IaWA presses down the price point such that the cost per player per hour of generated play approaches nil.<br/>It's a competition because fantastic games/systems like The Shadow of Yesterday, FATE and The Pool are given away for free.<br/><br/>You can write a game to exorcise your demons all you want, but the moment you let that beast out into the public - in print, electronically, for pay or for free - it becomes a player in a free market of products and ideas, competing for capital and/or mindshare. If it doesn't stack up against its competition, it sinks. If it's a viable competitor, it swims. Regardless, it's served your purpose of exorcising your demons and sticking it to the Man, but in the eyes of everybody else its value lies solely in how it gives existing games - including their own - a run for their money. <br/><br/>Without competition, our games would <i>suck</i>. Without harsh critique where our games are compared to games that came before, there would be no progress in our collective design. The games would be incoherent and likely unusable outside our own groups. Even with a high degree of mutualism, an extreme amount of acceptance - in the "each game is a special butterfly" sense - would kill the healthy culture of competition we currently enjoy, whether we want to admit the existence of competition or not.<br/><br/>Burning Empires did two things for me. One, it set a target for quality that I could aim for, and I am certain anything I release to the public will be better for it. Two, it set a target for quality which is so high I will probably never reach it, which means any game of mine will be unfavourably compared with BE in that category. The first thing is encouraging, the second is intimidating - but both help me make better games.<br/><br/>Does that make better sense, Luke?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

It was the first indie game I laid out dough for. I haven't played it yet because my gaming groups haven't displayed sufficient interest in the game's strategic elements to overcome the learning curve.<br/><br/>I am extremely happy Luke made BE. I am extremely happy for its success. I most definitely consider it part of the "indie" game library, for any given definition of indie. If I didn't consider it indie - as with D&amp;D - it wouldn't apply as a comparison to my own efforts. That is why I am intimidated - because I know Luke did all that work himself, and that's like, fucking superhuman. Ubermensch are scary people. Knowing that, when I do put some sort of game out for public consumption, it will on some level be compared to BE (and I will be compared to Luke) is close to paralyzing for my creative processes.<br/><br/>Then I look at something like IaWA and I'm more encouraged. Not because it's worse than BE as a game, but because given a metric shit-ton of good ideas, razor-sharp development, intense playtesting, harsh editing and grueling layout work, I believe I can make something that can sit next to it on a gamer's shelf and not look completely out of place.<br/><br/>That doesn't really have anything to do with mutualism or lack thereof. Luke and others should definitely aim for the stars if they want to, and our community will increase its overall product quality as a result. The point of my (first) post was to lend some credence to Vincent Baker's comment on the podcast, but also to make the claim that there are things Luke and other developers can - and <b>are</b> - doing to contribute to mutualism in the process of making, testing and running their games.<br/><br/>That's all.

This is the part of gaming that makes me weep, the part where gamers are fascinated by production value and pretty covers and not whether something is actually a good system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136651/#Comment_136651" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T09:59:37+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  9:59AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hehe... what makes <i>me</i> weep is any judgment of an aesthetic reference product which prioritizes (or disregards) any of these elements: (re)playability, presentation, clarity, diction, innovation, tone, manufacturer/author, or elements of inspiration. <i>BE</i> has them all, of course, in equal measure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395110/#Comment_395110" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T05:11:50+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  5:11AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RISE FROM THE GRAVE, THREAD!<br/><br/>This is the money quote, from Luke, in context. Jesus, he's not over here as much anymore, so this shit gets lost.\n<blockquote><blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I can sympathize with the people who were disheartened, rather than encouraged, by Burning Empires. I could even feel a tinge of sympathy for a total ass such as Vincent Baker, but apparently game designing gave him more money than God, so, you know, go fuck yourself, no sympathy here.<br/><br/>But yeah, it's intimidating. A fat high production value book based on a real license, written by this one guy who then goes on to win an Origin's Award. How could anyone hope to just pop up and compete with that?<br/><br/>Or for that matter, Rob and Fred, Spirit of the Century.<br/><br/>But these works do, when you think about it, serve well to define a target for independently published games to aspire to. As long as 600-page full colour monstrosities are not the norm, there's still a considerable space for less accomplished designers with good ideas to play in.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is it. This is what kills me: "Intimidating," "Compete," "Less accomplished designers." Even in jest, there's a clues to the roots of these misconceptions.<br/><br/>It's not a competition. I'm not trying to scare anyone. I produced a game to exorcise my demons <i>just like Vincent did with Dogs</i>. More than that, I'm just like the rest of you: I'm like everyone who's published a game -- no worse, no better -- but I'm even more like <i>everyone who hasn't published a game but wants to.</i> I remember what it was like before I put a game out and I still go through all the same bullshit now as I did then. Putting me or what I do in any other category than that is putting yourself down. Anyone can do what I did. <i>That was the fucking point of producing Burning Empires.</i> It wasn't a fuck YOU, it was a fuck THEM.<br/><br/>-L</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395111/#Comment_395111" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T05:32:34+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  5:32AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.
