As <a href="/forums/profile/Cneph">@Cneph</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">@jackson_tegu</a> have very nicely pointed out, the Kitsune's motivations to change shape are different from those of both the Cuckoo and the Doppleganger. The Kitsune takes on other people's forms <i>specifically</i> to trick others or to cause trouble for the person who's form they stole. This realization has allowed me to keep developing it, when my first instinct was to simply give up given the presence of other shapeshifters.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414494/#Comment_414494" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-21T21:33:38+00:00" title="May 21, 2013  9:33PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, a skin is both a type of monster and a type of student.

Some Kitsune intentionally take the form of young women walking alone at night specifically so they can waylay and eat travelers. Others take that form because they've fallen in love with a human. I rolled a bit of the Korean Kuniho into the skin too, which is <i>always</i> malicious (that's where one of the names and the "devoured a thousand livers"origin comes from).<br/><br/>The malicious bent of the skin is intentional, both to help give it a "real world, non-supernatural" identity (the pathological liar), and because my buddy and I think we <i>have</i> to do a skin for the Tanuki, another shapeshifter.

To the internets! I realize that good Skins have several "flavors" or "modes" in them that touch on either their different natures or the different mythologies of the thing that Skin is about. As you said, The Vampire isn't just one version of the vampire; it's <i>all</i> of them (or at least quite a few of them). Foxes are the trickester figure in a lot of cultures' folklore and mythologies. I even considered mixing some Coyote elements into the Skin.<br/><br/>All that being said though, I'm trying to retain a distinctly Japanese feel to the Skin. My friend (who I bounce idea off of and keep trying to get to join the damn forums) and I have brainstormed several creatures from Japanese folklore that we think would make good Skins. Our goal (though it is a lofty one which may never see completion) is to eventually put together a small <i>Monsterhearts</i> supplement called <i>Foreign Exchange Students</i>. We're envisioning it as a collection of distinctly non-European Skins divided into sections based on country or geographic region. Each section would have a few new Skins based on iconic creatures from that region, and possibly even new Moves or new names for the original Skins to give them the flavor of a different culture. It's a big goal as I said, and it may never happen. But we're still going to try.<br/><br/>I hadn't thought of the "crazy chicks are hot" image when choosing stats, though making hot and dark their high stats could look that way. I simply thought "Kitsune are manipulative and magical, so hot and dark". Maybe that should be reexamined.<br/><br/>Stories do often have people catching glimpses of the Kitsune's tail or other fox features, especially when they are fleeing from danger. The 'Sunshower' move was trying to capture a bit of that, but the move is getting scrapped. Perhaps a modification of the 'run away' move. Like "When you 'run away' add this option to the 7-9 list: people catch a glimpse of your tail; you gain the Condition <i>suspect</i>." Why someone would take that when there's no real benefit is problematic.

I am so into it. <br/><br/>Y'know what would be cool is if Foreign Exchange Students were spins on current skins. Like the kid from Mongolia is an Alma, not a Sasquatch, and has just a couple different moves. Then you can steal moves from the main skins like gangbusters. Way less work that way. You could pick the least played or least favorite skins and rework them to make them more interesting. I have trouble getting into the Fae, for example. Maybe if they were rewritten as a Yaksha, it would give me more to work with.<br/><br/>Also, I wasn't calling you out on the "crazy chicks" thing. <i>My</i> mind went there immediately and I was like, "whoops, try to keep the unhelpful sterotypes out of it, Morgan."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414637/#Comment_414637" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T14:15:03+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  2:15PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2013 2:15PM by jackson_tegu.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Echoing what Lisa was saying above, &amp; adding something that Jay Loomis said at Fabulous Replacement - Jay said, approximately &amp; better, <br/><br/>These aren't monster teenagers with monster problems - these are monster teenagers with teenager problems. It's about how they react to school, and parents, and love, and feeling left out. The needs they're trying to get met have to do with immediate things, things that touch on what we players went through as teenagers.<br/><br/>Edited to say: Foreign Exchange Students sounds super rad!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
