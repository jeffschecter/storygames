One of my regular groups (actually my most regular group) is a bi-weekly gaming group. Here's how we organize our "stuff":<br/><br/>*Whoever GMs always keeps the character sheets. This isn't for fear of cheating/changing them, rather it's so that someone doesn't forget their sheet, and thus set everyone back.<br/><br/>* When *I* GM, I keep all my scratch paper, character sheets, NPC notes and stuff in either a Trapper(tm) folder (blue), or a psychadelic fractal folder. Sometimes, if there's a lot of data (or time spent on a campaign), I'll make that folder "permanent" and add it to my bookcase. Currently, I have about 4 such folders: A fat one filled with The Riddle of Steel printouts, character sheets and data. A thinner one filled with With Great Power/Night Watch sheets, printouts, printed Google maps of Seattle (the setting), NPC notes, pages with R-Maps on them, etc.<br/><br/>* For our group, we used to just email each other to organize for a session. The other week I set up a new Google Group: This gives us a group email, and a "play area" to create things like wiki-ish pages, or to upload files. Currently, I am using it to store all the data for our L5R game electronically, from an XLS of all the character stats, to sheets with NPCs and motivations, game rules/hacks, etc. We use the group mail address to organize for the gaming day ("Tomorrow, right?" "Yep." etc).<br/><br/>Of the above, I would give the Google Group a fat thumbs up, but the problem with it is that you can't organize stuff by "folder". So all this L5R data is just sitting there in this pile on our group page. If there were a way to create folders, I could sort this data by campaign: I could post a folder for L5R, the next GM could post a folder for his game, and so on. For a group that might create lots of data, that could be a deal-breaker.<br/><br/>How about you and yours?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137547/#Comment_137547" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-01T20:27:18+00:00" title="April  1, 2008  8:27PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  We keep the char sheets on the table we play at.

But I believe that every group I'm involved in has a game wiki, livejournal group, email list or the like, where I can post my character sheet and other relevant data.

(And with certain GMs, the odds of losing your sheet that way are pretty high!)  If some of the NPC-playing duties are farmed out to the rest of the group, NPC sheets (if any) usually go back to the GM afterwards.<br/><br/>Each person who GMs a game in our group has a different style.  Each typically takes their notes on paper (looseleaf binder, spiral-bound notebook, legal pad, graph paper, whatever), but organization after that varies from "jam all my notes into one big messy pile" to "have a box of index cards with neat section divisions" to "type up my notes afterwards and clean them up for easy reading" to god knows what else.<br/><br/>We send e-mail around to organize the game, and have a forum to do other discussions.  Most of our games end up having a website at some point, but they're rarely if ever updated consistently -- at some point, real life intervenes and the updates stop.  We tried the wiki thing, but it was a bust -- only two people in the group actually like working with wikis and no one else even bothered to look at it.<br/><br/>Before a game starts, we tend to do a lot of face-to-face discussion about it.  At least one and sometimes two or three sessions can be nothing but talking about what we're going to play next, what kind of game we want it to be, character creation, gameplay examples, long- and short-term ideas for the game, and so on.  Of all of the group organization techniques we use, this is probably tied for Most Important with "e-mail to let everyone know when we're playing."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137616/#Comment_137616" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T07:30:07+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  7:30AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I maintain an RPG community site called <a href="http://www.hammergames.org" rel="nofollow">Hammer Games</a>, which is currently built on XOOPS (thinking about migrating - suggestions?). As such, it was a breeze to plug in forums, a calendar application and a wiki. Currently, most of the games I play in use the wiki as a character repository (see <a href="http://www.hammergames.org/modules/mediawiki/index.php/Ars_Magica:_Martine" rel="nofollow">this</a> for a recent example) and we've started using the forum for between-session planning and occasionally even for forum role-play, in cases where it makes sense to do so.<br/><br/>Like Accounting, we've had some problems since not all of our players are into editing wikis, posting on forums, or even checking their damn email (GAH!). Yet, the benefits of a central, public, editable, regularly backed-up repository of characters seem to outweigh the occasional transcription job the computing-adept among us have to perform for the less able.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137621/#Comment_137621" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T07:51:38+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  7:51AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the momement, I'm not actively gaming. My next game will not be hosted here at home, so I will have to adjust things.<br/><br/>How I have organized things for the past 5 years or so:<br/><br/>I have a plastic hanging file case with handle that is used to keep notes on the active campaign together assuming the campaign is something that needs more than a few notes. I keep all the PC character sheets in one folder, NPC sheets in another folder, dead, retired, or otherwise innactive PCs in a third folder. Another folder holds session notes for myself. If there are lots of session notes etc. for the players, they will be in another folder. Additional folders depend on the game in play and can include folders for setting materials, the rule book might fit in the case, when playing a module, it might be in the case, there might be a folder for maps. In my first Arcana Unearthed (d20) campaign, I kept detailed session notes and the notes from previous sessions went into yet another folder.<br/><br/>Campaigns with lots of supplemental rules or setting information that I have printed out will be organized into notebooks (with whole PDF books printed and bound into report covers). I used to use a rolling TV cart as a combination of table space for my notes and dice, and underneath, all the books in use (though RuneQuest and D20 both always blew out the ability to keep all the books handy). Sometimes it held a stack of those plastic "in box" trays with blank paper, various notes, maps, etc. stored there.<br/><br/>The file case will definitely be continued (I actually started using one in college) since it's a handy portable organization system. With my next campaign planned to be original D&amp;D, with the rules compiled into Word documents, I hope to be able to keep everything in the case (I will probably also print out the PDFs to have the original rules available in case there's a question how I house ruled something)<br/><br/>When I started the Arcana Unearthed campaign, I also started a Yahoo group that I use. Mostly we use it for e-mail purposes. I was trying to keep a data base of who was available for the next session but that never worked perfectly. I have also created data bases to find out game preferences and to keep contact information, I have also used polls to determine play schedules or game preferences. I have posted a few files to the file area (handy for making not entirely legal rules compilations to members of the group for example).<br/><br/>A note on GM keeping character sheets: I think this is handy for games where there is a lot of flags on the sheet for the GM to use in prep. There are lots of trust issues involved with who holds onto the sheets. I am way past playing with players where fear of players cheating on their sheets is real, though I have occaisionally audited character sheets and found errors (probably more often, the player was missing out on a bonus or some skill points rather than claiming too many bonuses or skill points). Fear of losing sheets or forgetting them or whatever is a trust issue too, but I think it's one where there is a lot of logic in the GM holding everything. If the GM forgets his notes, or loses them, for most campaigns, the game is rather dead. What I would love is a way to easily maintain two copies of sheets. Unfortunately, while electronic character sheets meet this need, I prefer hard copy, but don't want to kill trees by printing out new sheets every game session or two or three. With my upcomming D&amp;D game, we are looking at alternating GMs (either within a single campaign, or structuring it like the "multi-verse" of the old days where each GM had their own campaign, but PCs could visit other campaigns). In that case, it may make sense for players to hold onto their sheets since there would be no reason for the game to not run on a particular week because the GM isn't available.

I encouraged the switch to Google, as GG allows for me to use my own mailing list (part of my web hosting account), but still have the messages archived on the Goog. This was important, as Yahoo's mail delivery is spotty at best.<br/><br/>Electronic copies of character sheets go on the Google group. Physical copies are the players' responsibilities, though some of our more casual/sporadic players give their copies to others for safe keeping.<br/><br/>I don't write session logs or anything, though I was giving out bonus XP to people who wanted to write up their own. The resulting logs get stored on the group, as well as the XP spreadsheets that I manage. (Yes, this is all D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>As for my own notes, they usually start in Word, Pages, or OmniOutliner/Graffle. I don't worry to much about the physical copies; they tend to end up piled in a box. I do have a spiral-bound, quad-ruled notebook that I use for all my gaming; it's mostly a collection of initiative and hit point scribbles from over the years. However, for a recent SWSE game we started, I instead used a artsy square notebook I got at a seminar, 'cause SWSE is all about square books.<br/><br/>I'd honestly like to get a little bit more organized, but none of my gaming has really demanded it.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, as for organizing, we do it all via our email list. We have a set biweekly schedule, though, so the emails are mostly confirming who can make it that week and what's being run. We tend to do as much prep as possible via email so that sessions can focus on play. I'm trying to push the idea of group chargen at the table, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137716/#Comment_137716" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T13:05:21+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  1:05PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm actually playing in two groups. One group is a local group, and we don't do anything wacky for organization. The GM hangs on to character sheets, since we take turns hosting and it's easy for sheets to get forgotten. We tend to play prep-light games, so not a whole lot of other info is needed. I'm running Dogs right now, and I have a seperate notebook for that with town info, but that's about it.<br/><br/>We've had to get more creative with our other group, which is made up of former members of our Ohio group. We're all living in different states now, so we play over Skype. That means centralizing information has been a bit of a challenge. Most recently we've been playing IaWA, and we set up a wiki for that game. That turned out to be really handy in terms of tracking things from one chapter to the next, and I think we might use something similar for some of our games in the future.<br/><br/>~Anna                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137724/#Comment_137724" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T13:36:50+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  1:36PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quintin, that file box is similar to the ones I use.<br/><br/>I like the idea of using a laptop. Back in the day, I used a Compaq luggable computer for a Traveler campaign and it was really neat. But these days, I find I just don't want a computer on the table when I am running. Perhaps it's because of how much of my life happens on the computer that I prefer to dispense with computers when role playing.<br/><br/>I think there is also a problem of computer interfaces not being perfect. I can update a character sheet quicker with pen and paper. I can track NPC hit points and such quicker with pen and paper. I can lay out 3 or 4 sheets of paper plus have a GM screen with charts and tables standing up and have more information accessible at once than on a laptop.<br/><br/>The Traveler campaign and computer worked out in part because the character sheets were so simple I just kept a text document (opened in Borland's Side Kick) with a session log, information about the PCs ship, notes to myself, and a 3-6 line writeup of each PC (attributes, skills, equipment). In the foreground, I ran a program that tracked the ship's fuel (I had my own star ship system). I could see several PCs on the screen at once, and easily scroll to the top (log) or bottom (characters) to find the information I needed.<br/><br/>I suppose with my upcoming OD&amp;D campaign, I might be able to do something similar because the character sheets would be comparable in complexity, and I could easily keep two windows open, one with my dungeon notes, the other with my PC notes. I'd probably still use pen and paper to track monster hit points in combat though.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137743/#Comment_137743" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T15:05:44+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  3:05PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have a Yahoo group for almost every campaign.  I'd prefer Google Groups, but the consensus in my gaming circle is that most people watch their existing Yahoo groups and prefer to keep everything in one place.  Regardless, we need a mailing list because too many people have a hard time telling the difference between "Reply" and "Reply All" (I need a :rolleyes: smilie here.)  Having a calendar with reminders and some place to upload files is also really useful.  <br/><br/>I used to also create Websites for each game I was in, coded in HTML and CSS, but it took too much of my time and nowadays I set up wikis instead.  I've used pbWiki, Wetpaint, and more recently, Wikidot which has become my favourite -- it's easy to edit and it offers nice tools such as site forums.  When I'm GM, I require every player to post their character sheet so we can download it someone forgets their copy at home.  Some players prefer to leave their character sheet with the GM, some want to hold on to it, but I want a copy so I can plan my games.  My paper notes I keep in a 3-ring binder, with plastic pockets for the character sheets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
