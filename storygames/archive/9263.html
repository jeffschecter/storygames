I'm working on a game idea that is set during World War II, and one aspect of the game involves researchers and civilians working as part of the German government under Hitler.  This could happen off-screen as part of the back-story of the game or it could be directly tied to the players- that is, the PCs would be working for Germany during the Nazi regime.  Of course, there would be no reason to play them as Nazis, and the characters could be very sympathetic- struggling to support their nation while quietly resisting fascism, etc.<br/><br/>So my question(s):<br/><br/>1) Would you find this to be a fun and interesting play challenge or would the very idea of working under Hitler be a buzz-kill?  <br/><br/>2) Would the answer be any different if we were talking about playing hapless front-line German soldiers? <br/><br/>3) What lines and veils would you feel were necessary to keep play from straying too far out of your comfort zone?  <br/><br/>Having played some of this out before, I know at least one of my friends who felt uncomfortable with this, and we shifted the scope of our play to accommodate him.   Also, being an American, I'm especially interested in hearing the perspective of folks from other countries on this.  <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205002/#Comment_205002" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T07:23:49+00:00" title="May  3, 2009  7:23AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2009 7:24AM by Graham.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm comfortable with this and it sounds interesting.

You've said:\n<blockquote>1) Would you find this to be a fun and interesting play challenge or would the very idea of working under Hitler be a buzz-kill?</blockquote>\nI'm sure it can be interesting and satisfying, but what is the desire for "fun"? I think when people say "fun" they usually don't mean they derive something that can be called "enjoyment" from it, but the happy, light version, which may not be something to aim for.<br/><br/>The answer to question 3 would be that a GM shouldn't do the usual "This is what I'm willing to run" thing with this game. He should tell people what the game is about, and ask them if they're willing to play. And as always about boundaries, when one person says no don't try to convince them, it's a form of pressuring, stop. About the in-game veils and boundaries? I'd definitely stay away from graphic descriptions, even if your character does do something that is... bad, I'd just describe it, even though that would take away from the emotional impact, there's an opposite risk - emotional porn.<br/><br/>I think some people who talk about how their characters raped, and murdered, and tortured? They do this because they are <i>not</i> deeply engrossed in the character and(/or?) to show how "superior" as role-players they are, both willing and capable to play through anything. That's a load of bull. It's like teenagers who watch movies like Saw, or who watched the hot-fat shot in Watchmen and laugh.<br/><br/>Bleak and stark often mean stripped down. Less is sometimes more.<br/><br/>As for "Front-line soldiers", that's almost another issue. Then you'd consider why they do it, what it means to them - protecting their country, serving their leader, being one of the community? And if you just play them as soldiers without exploring the reasons, then it's pure colour, and couldn't matter less that Hitler is their leader.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205066/#Comment_205066" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T16:20:17+00:00" title="May  3, 2009  4:20PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would totally dig on playing a Nazi as long as the system didn't reward me for committing atrocities or something stupid like that.

If that's something this game provides (even indirectly), I'd be excited about it. If it's just some paranormal pulp game, then I'd want to know why I'm no just working for the allies. On the other hand, I'd feel really uncomfortable with a game that implied the nazis were just "complicated character" trying to do their best in a difficult world. If there are nazis, I want to see evil nazis. If there also happen to be characters who are entangled in nazism, but not necessarily evil, that's cool with me.<br/><br/>That said, nazism is obviously a touch subject. Nazi symbology may be seen as politically charged, even if presented in a ficticious or historical setting.

To be clear, the game won't intentionally be focused on the Holocaust, but because the history is there, there is potential for the players to move the story in that direction if they choose, particularly if their characters are on the inside.<br/><br/>Thanks for your perspective- I understand your point about serious games and fun, and it's one I've considered a lot as we've discussed <em>Grey Ranks</em>.   I think there's always room for fun when building stories collaboratively, but there's definitely a different weight to carry when dealing with such heavy issues.<br/><br/>Tony, there's definitely a heart of paranormal pulp to this, but I'm hoping that the whole is richer and more interesting than the parts.  To address part of what you said, my default assumption is that players will be playing Allied characters, but I wanted to test the waters and see whether playing both sides at different times would have broader appeal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205084/#Comment_205084" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T19:05:00+00:00" title="May  3, 2009  7:05PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Been thinking about this today.

I'm not sorry that I played that game, but it was better as a one-shot; I don't think that I could have played even an <i>opponent</i> of Hitler within the Nazi party as an ongoing campaign.<br/><br/>Nazism was a very dark thing, and many people have strong feelings about it. Even if the characters you portray have no direct connection to the worst Nazi atrocities (Gregor Strasser died before the Final Solution), there's a ... pollution from being close to those monsters.

There were some pretty famous people who fell into that category: Heisenberg, Jung.... I would want to have a <i>very </i> serious discussion of lines and veils before a game like this, though.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, there was somebody like Heidegger who was a fairly enthusiastic Nazi and jew-hunter.  That would be a step too far, and I wouldn't want any of the other players to go there either.<br/><br/>EDIT: On second thought, Mann moved to California for the duration of the war.

You are Good People. But there's a huge amount of social and even legal pressure to be otherwise.  A best case goal of the game might be something like Oskar Schindler, using the system to do some good. But the mechanical pressure of the system would empower you more to feed the Nazi agenda (which shouldn't always be the worst evil of killing Jews and other marginalized groups, but helping the political and war effort in someway).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206169/#Comment_206169" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T15:52:11+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  3:52PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a game last summer called Valkyrie that hews pretty closely to your thesis, Alvin.
