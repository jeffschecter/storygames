                            These discussions get into the subject of solitaire rpgs. I like them because they represent views of both people that are skeptical and people who see solo roleplaying as a possibility. You might even say there is almost an evolving attitude towards the subject.

                            Apocalypse World and other "PbtA" ("Powered by the Apocalypse") games have been quite popular at Story Games and have received a lot of discussion, especially Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, and Dungeon World. <br/><br/>We've had a few interesting threads, like this one, where people challenged each other to create custom moves for PbtA games. If you're working on moves for PbtA games, all of the following are worth taking a look at:
<blockquote><b><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13109/apocalypse-world-custom-moves-make-the-game" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World: Custom moves make the game</a></b></blockquote>
There were some other, similar threads, which got pretty funny, include the infamous "on a miss, wolves" thread:
<blockquote><b><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19130/on-a-miss-wolves" rel="nofollow">On a miss, wolves</a></b></blockquote>
And the followup:
<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20550/on-a-miss-you-fall-on-a-bear" rel="nofollow">On a miss, you fall on a bear</a></b></blockquote>
There have been times when these discussions got beyond humorous, like this discussion which looks at what it might be look to be the Biblical God in the context of PbtA design:

                            This discussion ended up covering so many of the core concepts of games and game designs. I think it highlights well the different schools of thought about games, what we expect out of them and frankly the passion of the individuals involved in the discussion. <br/><br/>As a very broad topic I think it was very enlightening.

                            We had a brief but very constructive conversation about what to do with traditional "linear" adventure modules - adventures which expect you to play through them in a predetermined way, with a set starting point and endpoint. If you'd like to play in a style that's more open-ended, but want to use the material in those adventure modules you already own, how would you do that? Some good tips and techniques can be found here:

                            Occasionally we have been known to dissect a particular game, creating discussions and guides to getting the most out of it. Some people consider the very first "story game" RPG (at least consciously so) to be Ron Edwards's <i>Sorcerer</i>. <br/><br/>However, the game is notoriously "difficult" for some people, who tend to struggle with it before "getting it". Nevertheless, those people often turn into <i>Sorcerer's</i> greatest fans. About a decade ago, Jesse Burneko wrote a series of threads which serve as a guide to understanding and playing that game, in great depth:
<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/5957/practice-sorcerer-all-in-one-place" rel="nofollow">[Practice: Sorcerer] All in one place</a></b></blockquote>

<b><i>D&amp;D</i></b>, the classic RPG at the root of the hobby, has always received a lot of discussion here. Of particular interest is hearing how people have made the game their own. Several posters have formulated their specific way of running and playing D&amp;D at their table, in great detail, both in terms of specific techniques and in terms of broader philosophical and aesthetic approaches.<br/><br/>These are great to investigate - whether you're looking for a whole new way to play D&amp;D or just to borrow a house rule or two.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> has been developing a variety of house rules for 5e, to the point of starting to refer to her house rules as "2097e". These include procedures for all kinds of things, like who the monsters attack in combat (a sort of "monster AI", to aid in objectivity and let the GM just adjudicate outcomes). If you follow the links, you'll find a variety of discussions, house rules, and experiments:
<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21581/2097-d-d-house-rules-as-per-pauls-request" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D House Rules [2097e]</a></b></blockquote>
<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> has his own version and style of running D&amp;D5e, with, among other things, an experience system inspired, in part, by <i>Dungeon World</i>:

<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> posted in great detail about his own "City of Brass/Mirrorrim" campaign, which involves a number of really unusual choices, from the particulars of the setting, to the detailed play agenda, to new races and rules modifications. Deals with social issues (like poverty!) in an urban setting in a most unusual way, and you can see the evolution and development from a novel concept for a con game to a megadungeon campaign in this series of threads:

There have been a number of threads dealing with how to run 4th Edition, as well. (Here are a few examples:)<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/7879/ganakagok-ified-d-d-4e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/7879/ganakagok-ified-d-d-4e</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13680/story-gaming-d-d-4e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13680/story-gaming-d-d-4e</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/16138/d-d4e-big-next-time-gadget-techniques-for-fictionful-4e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/16138/d-d4e-big-next-time-gadget-techniques-for-fictionful-4e</a><br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting, though, is this treatment of <i>The Chronicles of Prydain</i> as a heavily structured D&amp;D campaign, by <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> :
<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21460/d-d-4th-some-notes-on-my-chronicles-of-prydain-microcampaign" rel="nofollow">[D&amp;D 4th] Some notes on my Chronicles of Prydain microcampaign</a></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21762/d-d-4th-chronicles-of-prydain-campaign-notes/p1" rel="nofollow">[D&amp;D 4th] Chronicles of Prydain Campaign Notes</a></b></blockquote>
Eero has also written a lot about his idea of "primitive D&amp;D", which is, in many respects, an approach to "old-school" or "OSR-style" D&amp;D, but, in other ways, breaks from the OSR tradition. His thoughts have spawned a number of discussions on the nature of "challenge-based adventure" play. You can see how that all got started here:
<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/14363/lets-ask-eero-about-primitive-d-d" rel="nofollow">Let's ask Eero about Primitive D&amp;D</a></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d" rel="nofollow">Writing up Eero's Primordial D&amp;D</a></b></blockquote>
We have also discussed D&amp;D as a larger phenomenon, with particular attention to the online game/show <i>Critical Role</i> - a controversial but very interesting discussion, as I struggle with the idea of a new following for this classic game inspired by watching other people play online:

                            Other games occasionally get a thorough treatment, as well. For example, here is a guide for how to play <i>Vampire</i>:
