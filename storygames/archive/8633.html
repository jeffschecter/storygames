If you've played the game you know what this is about. You against a bunch of enemies, preferably on a rooftop, back and forth and throwing people of said rooftop. But the thing about it is that it is fast, all about reaction time and quick thinking and looking for that oppertunity to counter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I ODed on Afro Samurai a while back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also love the plannig ahead of Burning Wheel. But this doesn't give me the dynamic I am looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hand to hand rules of Conspiracy X got close to this, but no cigar there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there came along this game design contest here in Norway. And I went through several ideas. This one didn't make the cut.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I need to share it before it is lost in the background noise of my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Core system:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nYou roll a D6 + skill versus a target number.<br/>\nTarget number is based on what kind of Attack you pick. -&gt; a simple list needed here (availability might be skill based, or build your own fighting style approach)<br/>\nYou need three different colours for your dice, lets just say red, white and blue.<br/>\nThe characters have stat/skill that determine number of dice in your pool. ( I imagine you can do some cool thematic stuff with the varying the pool sizes dependent on the situation/condition of the character).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fighting</b><br/>\nYes its droll, but that is what this idea is all about.<br/>\nSomehow you determine who goes first. (bidding from your pool, or maybe a sort of L5R build up with badness going to the guy who attacks first, yet build up gives bonus to attack). The important thing is you have one attacker, one defender. You only determine this in the beginning of the fight. What to do with many on one comes later.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you have attacker and defender.<br/>\nThere are three zones that the attacker may go for and subsequently three zones that might be defended. High, Middel and Low. Each corresponds to  a die colour:<br/>\nred die -&gt; high zone (head, neck shoulders)<br/>\nwhite die -&gt; middle (chest and abdomed)<br/>\nblue die -&gt; low (thighs and legs)<br/>\nBoth attacker and defender needs to pick a number of dice equal to their pool. They pick from the different colours in secret, and hold their dice in their hand (lets call this the Hand).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey then pick a single die from their hand (still in secret) and roll at the same time. The attacker annouces what kind of attack move his character uses as he/she.<br/>\nWhen the dice are on the table we look at and compare the following.<br/>\n1. Total of die + skill.<br/>\n2. Colour. Are the dice the same colour or are they not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Total.</i><br/>\nThe attacker needs to roll as high as possible. If the total is higher than the attack target number he scores a Hit.<br/>\nThe defenders total needs to be above the block target number. Preferably above the attackers total aswell.<br/>\nThis gives us the following combinations.<br/>\n<br/>\na. Attacker hits - defender misses block.<br/>\nb. Attacker hits - defender matches block but not attacker total<br/>\nc. Attacker hits - defender matches attackers total.<br/>\nd. Attacker misses - defender blocks.<br/>\n(both misses - in which we just roll the next die)<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Colour.</i><br/>\nLets look at what happens if the colours don't match.<br/>\nCombination a. means the attacker lands a Hard Blow.<br/>\nCombination b. means the attacker lands a Weak Blow.<br/>\nCombination c. means the defender blocks.<br/>\nCombination d. means that Attacker/Defender roles switches (they still have to finish their Hand, no refilling from pool).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the defender guessed/predicted the right zone.<br/>\nCombination a. Attacker still lands a Hard Blow.<br/>\nCombination b. Defender blocks.<br/>\nCombination c. Defender blocks and may use counter move (limited set of moves that lands blows on the original attacker). Attacker defender role switches.<br/>\nCombination d. means that Attacker/Defender roles switches (they still have to finish their Hand, no refilling from pool).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay flows back and forth like this until the Attacker's Hand is spent.<br/>\nIt is then refilled and play proceeds until one of the parties is Finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the Defender has more dice left these are not spent.<br/>\nIf at some point the Attacker still has dice left in his hand, but the defender is out, the attacker rolls the dice left, looks at the totals and each hit lands a Hard Blow.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191147/#Comment_191147" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T02:31:14+00:00" title="February  4, 2009  2:31AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Taking a beating</b><br/>\nThe defender will take some blows. These accumulate. At some point this total passes a Threshold (Guts/grit kinda thing). At this point the attacker may Finish hir opponent (knock out, disarm, kill, hurt badly, different options based on weapon/fighting style maybe). Hard blows fill up the towards the threshold much faster than weak blows (maybe weak blows dissappear or reduced between rounds. Or your finishing options depends on the weak to hard blow relationship).<br/>\n<br/>\nA defender may trade down a Hard blow by taking a Knock Back. The effects of the Knock Back depends on what zone the Hard Blow lands in.<br/>\nLow zone -&gt; defender falls down (tactical constraints, vunerability or impossiblity of becoming the attacker/counter until back on feet. A combination of these).<br/>\nMiddle zone -&gt; defender is pushed back (into obstacles, off roofs, through windows. It is a viable strategi to be pushed of a roof to escape an impossible fight or to set up a chase)<br/>\nHigh zone -&gt; defender is stunned (hand size knocked down next round)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a game featuring armour then picking what zone may depend where the fighter is wearing armour. One possible solution is to have armour convert Hard Blows to Weak and Weak to nothing. I see a trade off between protectiveness and hand size. The important part is that this shouldn't be roll based. The only rolls should be attack-defend.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>many on one</b><br/>\nAlways try to break big fights into one on ones. Then switch between them at fitting intervals.<br/>\nThe source material is full of many on one fights. Here postioning becomes king. There is a limit to how many may pounce on the same guy/girl (say three/four). I'd go for an option where the who goes first determines who may attack.<br/>\nIf the lone guy is the attacker he picks a target. This defends, the others have to wait until there is a switch in who attacks.<br/>\nOnly those that beat the lone guy in the intiative may attack. The lone guy needs to roll one die for each attack to block. Not rolling a die counts as a failed block (hit -&gt; Hard Blow).  Any attacker that misses are out of the round.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis favours many on one tactics. Some weapons and fighting styles may work better in these situations. Some working better when many on one, some better the other way round.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>enemies</b><br/>\nI imagine that you'd divide the enemies into three catergories, Mooks, Champions and Bosses (more thematically appropiate and evocative names would be needed off course). with the mooks only dangerous in large groups, the champions fit for one on one duels and the bosses dangerous in one and one capable to fight against a group of PCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how far I got before I scrapped this idea. It could be used for a kung-fu game, samurai showdown, Final Fantasy Advent Children fights, Assasins Creed or maybe a Jedi game with cool powers thrown in (maybe forced unleashed could be used as inspiration). At least I have spread the meme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Books%20Burner" title="Books Burner"><img alt="Books Burner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/2913/avwg2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Books%20Burner">Books Burner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191165/#Comment_191165" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T05:19:27+00:00" title="February  4, 2009  5:19AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome Idea!<br><br>But you should use a Beast Hunters!<br><br>(Don't thank me Chris, I will always remember that you screw up Anima Prime)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191237/#Comment_191237" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T15:47:39+00:00" title="February  4, 2009  3:47PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beast hunters is indeed cool.

Let's take a look at Kaare's design here.<br><br>I like the idea of attack series and building up pressure.  Using different hit zones for that could be neat, too.  There was a German game a long time ago called Schwertmeister (swordmaster) that tried to use those elements, but it didn't work out so well IMO.<br><br>Now, the problem I see with your design here is that it doesn't really do what you were talking about with Assassin's Creed.  It doesn't look like the defender has a lot of choices or can make a big difference--the number of dice is limited by the pools (i.e., skill levels), and they always roll one die, albeit of different colors.  Given that a block only has a one-in-three chance of actually doing anything, the defender is deep in the hole here.  <br><br>After six attacks, assuming a 50% hit chance with the attack, the defender might finally block--after taking two heavy and one light blows (assuming the attacker goes hit-miss-hit-miss-hit-miss, and the defender wrong color-wrong color-right color miss-wrong color-wrong color-right color hit).  Things look worse if the attacker's chance at hitting is higher (but the whiff factor for both is already up there).  And there was little tactical choice to be made by the defender; picking the right color may or may not have a tinge of strategy if you know your opponent.<br><br>I would allow the rolling of more than one die for the defender at some cost, at least.  Maybe she gets hit hard for each die remaining in the attacker's pool when her own run out or something.  That way she can try and strategize some.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191306/#Comment_191306" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-05T10:40:42+00:00" title="February  5, 2009 10:40AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But Assassins Creed is about <i>reaction</i>, not <i>guessing.</i><br><br>How about: attacker and defender arrange their three dice out in front of them, symmetrically. Attacker holds an object above the table - maybe above a shallow box to keep it from rolling all over the place - and drops it. As soon as the object is dropped, attacker may reach for one of her three dice. By the time the attacker's chosen die is rolled and hits the table, the defender must have chosen a defending die and have it in her hand. (And yes, must then roll it for defense. If the defender hasn't chosen a die by then, maybe there is some fallback resource to spend on a weaker general defense.)<br><br>If you still want some planning, maybe the three dice are chosen in secret (from a larger selection of tactics) before they're laid out for the conflict, and then they're revealed.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191331/#Comment_191331" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-05T13:40:16+00:00" title="February  5, 2009  1:40PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jupp you are right.
