He will be referred to as GM in this book.<br/><br/>This project was born to help translate other games. We are not a very big game publisher. We are just a group of friends producing their own games indipendently and promoting RPGs all around!<br/><br/>You can, of course, download this game for free, but by donating the price of one coffee, you give us the possibility to translate our other games, Deus Opera, Holy Truth, Robot Commander and Dream of Me. All of these games have been published or are ready to be published in Italian.<br/><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/119751/Witness-Protection-Program-%28English-Edition%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/119751/Witness-Protection-Program-(English-Edition)</a><br/>Thank you very much!\xa0                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CynicalSleuth" title="CynicalSleuth"><img alt="CynicalSleuth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/538/n27XUW2DMWMWH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CynicalSleuth">CynicalSleuth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422327/#Comment_422327" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T14:31:14+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  2:31PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, very interesting.
