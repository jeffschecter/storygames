I'm behind a little here.)<br/><br/>Here's some random trivia for you!<br/><br/>Apparently, Pi Day was invented by "Larry Shaw". He may have a gaming connection:\n<blockquote>Larry didn't have much time to talk, because he was about to officiate a marriage happening on the "Pi Shrine," a metal plaque on the sidewalk imprinted with pi information. The retired physicist, once a senior media specialist at the Exploratorium, said this is actually the second wedding he's officiated. He once did a pirate-themed wedding for somebody who was really into Dungeons &amp; Dragons; he recalls that a guest pretended to rob the ring bearer, shouting, "It's all booty for me!"</blockquote>\nEnjoy some pie today or yesterday or tomorrow. Much love.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
