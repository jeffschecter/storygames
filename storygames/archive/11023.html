I'd been looking at using it for this, that and the other thing and also browsing the various hacks I'd seen posted.  This led to talk of the WWII variant and from there to other wars, like Vietnam.  And then things took a darker turn.<br/><br/>At this point I'm going to direct you to the <a href="http://www.samhawken.com/?p=2153" rel="nofollow">lengthy blog post</a> I made about using <i>3:16</i> to play out the neo-Nazi fantasy of a book called <i>Devil's Guard</i>.  After this point I'll assume you went there and read it so I don't have re-explain the point.<br/><br/>:: intermission music ::<br/><br/>Okay, let's continue.<br/><br/>As you can see, I'm building off my other <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10918&amp;page=1#Item_86" rel="nofollow">thread on playing a terrorist</a>, this idea of challenging players' base assumptions by encouraging (I don't like the term <i>forcing</i>) them to take on roles and attitudes they might under other circumstances find discomfiting.  I continue to wrestle with the sometimes fine line between productive transgression and gratuitous transgression.<br/><br/>What's the difference?  It seems to me that the strongest case for tackling challenging and/or unpleasant subject matter is whether or not there's something to be learned.  As we got from the (admittedly minor) controversy concerning the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10956&amp;page=1#Item_10" rel="nofollow">how to punish a slave</a> discussion, what's informative to one set of players can be just plain squick-tastic to another.  In the latter case there's not a lot to be learned except that some things are out of bounds.  Getting into a game where distinctions are drawn between ideology, reality and man's treatment of other men... that seems worthwhile, assuming it can be pulled off.<br/><br/>A lot would depend on the GM in this instance, posing situations that present three solutions: one based on the players' likely reaction and one based on the <i>characters</i>' likely reaction and one based on some kind of amalgamation of the two.  How a player threads the line through these goes a long way toward making such an exercise worthwhile as a learning experience instead of a hootin' and hollerin' celebration of the \xdcbermensch.<br/><br/>But get right down to the brass tacks, as I did in the blog entry, and what you have is a demand on players to take the role of human monsters.  There's no two ways about it.  And potential learning experience or no, is it worthwhile to even tackle that sort of thing in a roleplaying environment?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244398/#Comment_244398" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T11:39:51+00:00" title="December  1, 2009 11:39AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might be worthwhile in a couple of roleplaying environments I can think of, but none related to hobby games.

I won't even play Nazis (or the Confederacy, for that matter) in board games.<br/><br/>You might be able to work out some interesting individual stories in short sessions or as part of a broader plot, it's the reason Hans Landau works so well in <i>Inglorious Basterds</i>, but I think that playing such characters over any length of time will either be depressing or get reduced to parody pretty quickly. <br/><br/>The other unspoken huge problem with these scenarios (Nazi-style death camps, chattel slavery, etc) is they almost always involve the sexual domination and sadism, not to mention violent rape, that comes as part of the territory with such totalitarian power structures. Not a fun campaign for any women at the table (or homosexuals for that matter), unless you pull punches in a way that subverts your original question, I think.<br/><br/>IMO, there are just too many ways for a game like that to turn suddenly and perhaps irrevocably unpleasant that it's not worth whatever lessons might be learned; I think any of us that are socially-functioning human beings have probably already learned them. Getting folks to think is nice, and challenging a few ideas is not necessarily bad, but making the game into an ANTI-social situation is where you have to pull up.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244404/#Comment_244404" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T11:54:09+00:00" title="December  1, 2009 11:54AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.wargamedevelopments.org/Wargame%20Developments%20Handbook.pdf" rel="nofollow">This issue has</a>been discussed before by parts of the wargaming hobby community.

A game specifically designed to explore the unpleasant or<br/>uncomfortable aspects of conflict. Most of these deal with areas not usually considered "suitable" for games, such as<br/>terrorist attacks, bombing of population centres, or the moral dilemmas arising from conflict. Most wargames, however,<br/>contain "black" elements; after all, playing a game about war can be considered in poor taste in itself. A controversial<br/>area of WD activities that is surrounded by much hypocrisy. Two very successful examples of "Black Games" were<br/>"Home Front 86" where the players believed they were running a "refugee centre in Wales in WW3" but ended up<br/>running a Concentration Camp similar in operation to Bergen-Belsen (See Disguised Scenario) and an experimental<br/>"Northern Ireland Workshop" (See Workshop) where every aspect of the "troubles" were examined using improvised<br/>theatre, role-play, and traditional gaming techniques. Some supposedly "Black Games", dealing with the IRA threats to<br/>Army units, were in fact put on by serving military members of WD, in an honest attempt to gain additional insights into<br/>very real operational problems.

I can't believe I couldn't remember it before.] Robert Bohl, and Tim Kleinert) a few years back in which I played an ex-SS officer. He'd contributed to this mind-shattering horror, only to discover that he had a Jewish uncle, a fact he'd kept hidden until the end of thwar. His secret agenda in the mission was to find him and get his forgiveness.</p>\n<p>The character, Felix Baum, was a terror. He wore little black spectacles and a dark grey fedora, walked without a sound, and carried a pair of silenced Mausers. He did magic at one point that literally undid a victim completely from time, so thoroughly did he kill him. He had a clockwork heart with which he'd replaced his real heart so he could do what he did. He solved problems like you'd imagine a horror fiction Nazi assassin would: he killed them, thoroughly and efficiently.</p>\n<p>But he'd developed a sudden realization that what he did was awful, so he was trying to find his heart. He did, eventually \u2014 it was this shriveled, jerky-like thing in his ex-boss' (now Stasi) desk drawer. And he found his uncle, a horror of machine and man grafted together, cowering in the sewers of Berlin. Felix brought him coffee and they played chess together as the credits rolled.</p>\n<p>Now, what's interesting to me is the guy didn't stop being a monster at any point. The very reason I played that character was so that I, a Jew, could get in his head a little bit as a person. He was contrite, at least in theory, but mostly, he murdered people. OK, his reasons were pretty good, but nothing he did, or could do, made up for what he'd done. He killed some people who'd done evil things in the process, but that sure didn't make things better for anyone. And it's not like apologizing to this one guy, just because he suddenly saw him as like him, made him good.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245186/#Comment_245186" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T16:39:50+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  4:39PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, that game sounds terrific.

My orphanage is the best in the country, this is well-worth a little discomfort every once in a while, right? As long as no one gets hurt. Too much. I tell the men they must not leave marks. The boys are resilient, but we must remain discreet. The people, they wouldn't understand. One boy died. It was an accident, they told me so, and I believe them. They aren't monsters, after all. Just a little eccentric, they can afford to be. I fixed the paperwork, told the boys he was adopted. Some believed me. Oh I hope this doesn't get out. Not just for me.

Baltar and Tom Zarek are compelling characters in an ongoing story about how governments are run and how people become dictators or terrorists. Also, Rorsharch, the iconic super(hero?) from Watchmen, whose violent means of fighting justice are never justified in their own right, just explained. Ozymandias would be the ultimate example here.<br/><br/>As a lover of human monster stories (horror, vampires) these tales can be amazing. It just all depends how far you're willing to go.

They are indistinguishable from humans, just better looking, stronger. They regard people as 'cattle'.<br/><br/>The presence of ogres as a threat was integral to the Red Cow setting, they are a mythical enemy of the clan.<br/><br/>I decided to run with it to see what would happen. We discussed how to play such a character in a way that was sympathetic. I suggested looking to Dexter or Lecter as archetypes here. The killer gains sympathy if he acts in ways we wish we could, standing outside convention. If the audience hates the victim, then the killer is a sympathetic character because he acts simply as others, constrained by norms, would wish to. Provided we want the killer to triumph or at least evade detection, then the character can be a 'hero'. <br/><br/>I have some mixed feelings about how successful it has been in play for two reasons. The first is the inevitable problem that many of the murders do not go unnoticed, and so the authorities must choose to hunt the killer down. Of course revealing the player's as the killer, effectively ends the game for him, apart from some sort of dramatic swan song. This makes a lot of contests high stakes because, frankly I can only think of so many ways to narrate failure, that don't end up with the authorities on his tail.

It seems like it would create a nice amount of intra-party tension as they uncover the evil in the midst, and conflict over whether to cut him loose or close ranks around someone who's essentially a serial killer.<br/><br/>I mean, I can see how this could be troublesome if you have a different plot pathway you want them to go down, but I also figure you made some allowance for this eventuality by allowing the ogre in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248834/#Comment_248834" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T08:47:44+00:00" title="December 28, 2009  8:47AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2009 8:49AM by madunkieg.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing an apparently evil character isn't as special or offensive or objectionable as you make it out to be. There's someone who does it at practically every RPG game, the gamemaster. Do we make moral judgements on the GM for playing adversarial characters? No. Do GM's make moral judgements on themselves for playing such monsters? No. So why is it taboo to play such a character? Perhaps as players we make more effort to identify with our characters.<br/><br/>Now, here's a question, can you design a game in which your character does not morally reflect you as a player, put that right up front so that players feel more comfortable exploring what they may see as villainous behaviour. I'd like to propose that there are some out there. World of Darkness dips a toe into this pool, and Legend of the Five Rings does a beautiful job with the Scorpion clan, but I think Houses of the Blooded does it best, particularly the larp rules. An example:<br/><br/>At the start of the game, you get another player who will play your enemy. You approach that player, say "hi" and start a discussion as to how your characters will be enemies. You're making friends with the player all the while making enemies with the character. When that other person does something against you, you the player don't take it personally because you spent a great deal of time working with that other player to arrange such an event.<br/><br/>I want to see more of that in gaming, where the game does as much to create and reinforce friendships between players as it does to create conflicts in games. When games do that, we can open a lot more doors to gaming possibilities, including exploring monstrous behaviour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249397/#Comment_249397" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-02T17:25:28+00:00" title="January  2, 2010  5:25PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>I want to see more of that in gaming, where the game does as much to create and reinforce friendships between players as it does to create conflicts in games.

It works from two points: 1) the player character is not the player, and 2) the players themselves are building a collective story through their characters.  These would seem to be so simple conceptually that they needn't be explicated, but time and again I've seen players blow up over something one character did or said to another character that wasn't meant to be taken personally and yet was.<br/><br/>I'd like to think that as games move more toward actually storytelling as part of their mechanics, as opposed to handling things like driving cars or tossing softballs back and forth, the line between player and character will grow thicker, thus setting the stage for more daring and fulfilling play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249403/#Comment_249403" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-02T18:52:13+00:00" title="January  2, 2010  6:52PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>I'd like to think that as games move more toward actually storytelling as part of their mechanics, as opposed to handling things like driving cars or tossing softballs back and forth, the line between player and character will grow thicker, thus setting the stage for more daring and fulfilling play.</blockquote>\nActually, I think it more often goes the other way, that we're more connected and involved in the story than ever before, that people are taking bigger risks, having more empathy for the characters. Take the example Joshua Newman gives above, trying to get into the head of someone who holds very different beliefs. That's an attempt at empathy. With storytelling front and centre, investment in a character is now a lot more than just "did my chosen strategy work?" The story can now challenge beliefs. It's that increased connection that I think demands more recognition of the player's experience playing, as well as the needs of the story.<br/><br/>That's what I think the biggest mistake was with one of my game designs, I didn't do enough to recognize the player behind the character, putting them in very difficult situations demanding a lot of empathy, but not finding ways to make that empathy rewarding for the player even as the character met a tragic fate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250258/#Comment_250258" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-10T21:49:46+00:00" title="January 10, 2010  9:49PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ian Cooper</cite>Interesting, in our game, set amongst the Red Cow clan of the Cinsina, one of the players requested to play an Ogre.<br/><br/>For those who don't know Glorantha, ogres are cannibalistic uber-mensch.

I am very leery of players who want to do something that's significantly at odds with the generally agreed-upon texture and flavor of the game. It might be interesting, and it might be great, but the good odds are on it just annoying, even alienating, the other players and forcing the GM to find, as you say, increasingly strained ways to fit their non-standard character choice into the smooth flow of game-play.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

You make sure everyone's playing the same game. In the Cold City game I mentioned above, we were a bunch of players who a) knew what each other liked (with one exception, which I think we dealt with OK) and b) were playing to shared expectations, given the subject matter. It's fine for that to be a surprise <em>as long as it's OK with everyone for there to be real surprises</em>.</p>\n<p>You don't rope your friend who likes Demolition Man (this friend is obviously hypothetical) into seeing 2001 just because they're both science fiction.

Someone's gotta be doing all the detective legwork, putting stuff into the computer, following the money, following the women as a harmless-seeming old man. I picture Alfred as a guy who's been forced to drive himself to brilliance as much as Bruce, but because he cares about someone, not because he's in perpetual mourning.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251123/#Comment_251123" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-16T06:35:36+00:00" title="January 16, 2010  6:35AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>Ian, would it totally derail your game to have the authorities start to figure things out and put some pressure on the group?

Following divinations that revealed the murderer was hiding amidst the clan I had the authorities charge one of the other players - a Humakti - with tracking down the murderer. Perversely making the conflict one between the players seemed to ease the tension of beginning the hunt, I think because the ogre's player began making trades between his fun and the Humakti players fun. We already have a good social contract for PvP conflict without concern, it's all in the open and based on maximising fun for all.<br/><br/>As it should in Glorantha it ended up with competing and interwoven heroquests with the Humakti using the Summons of Evil to flush out his foe, and the ogre trying to convert more clan folk to Devil worship by spreading heresy. Both players seemed satisfied with the conclusion.<br/><br/>I think the lesson I learnt most was that if a player builds a highly-charged background like this then we have to agree beforehand that we will not defer but play it to the hilt, or not do it all.

I recall when I asked to play a vampire character in a <i>Shadowrun</i> game and all the trouble it caused because the GM was unable to weave this particular (and kind of important) character element into the ongoing game.  We had all these normal characters and one superhuman one, all without any idea how to mesh these together.  The end result?  A stillborn game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
