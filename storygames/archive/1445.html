                    I'm nowhere near the actual printing portion of DEAD, but I've started scoping out things like printers and box manufacturers now, because I figure it'll take quite a while for me to find one.  While I've been doing that, I've started to wonder about the first run of DEAD - how large it should be.  Of course, that also depends on how expensive it's going to be to produce (and any price breaks I get on printing) - if putting everything together costs $10 a set, I can afford twice to invest as much as $20 a set.<br/><br/>I was just wondering what has been comfortable for everyone else for the first print run, that they didn't feel like they were getting in over their heads, more than actual price breaks and the like. <br/><br/>How much were you willing to invest in your game before you knew if anyone would buy it?                </div>

About $800 so far; I haven't gone to press yet.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the money came from $1200 fund set up for me that could *only* be drawn from for education or to do business-type things, and I'm done my schoolin'.  So, uh, it's not like I had any other way to use it.                        </div>

                            With Don't Rest Your Head, I invested about $75 in it, and that was as much as I was willing to at the outset, because I didn't think anyone would be that "into" it (I was wrong).  I started out selling it through Lulu, and it turned out to do pretty well.  Eventually I got enough cash from that to put together about an 80-copy run to send to IPR.  Right now, it's fairly self-feeding; I just did my first "refill" of 100 copies for IPR.<br/><br/>With Spirit of the Century, I invested about $600 in the production.  It's a fairly sparse-art project there, and most of the money was sp ent on it last year.  Note, all $600 has been spent on the art, and most of the art is little 2"x4" rectangles, with at most one image placed per ten-ish pages in the 400-page product.  I ran a "willingness to buy" survey on evilhat's website and asked people on various Fate fan lists to respond to it.  The responses I got indicated that around 140 folks were willing to buy it (and willing to answer a survey saying as much).  Given that, I decided I was willing to lay out cash to preprint about 125 hardcover, 125 softcover versions of the product -- about a $4,000 cash outlay.  Luckily, the willingness-to-buy folks followed through (near as I can tell, at least), and then some -- we're up to 250 copies presold, and have since bumped those numbers to 175 hardcover, 200 softcover.  But note that those numbers got bumped up after we saw a lot of the preorders come in, so it was definitely done from an informed perspective.                        </div>

                            Brian, we decided that play-it-when-you-buy-it was worth the cost and irritation of getting our cards cut and collated.  We revisit that discussion with every print run.                        </div>

I think that knowing I needed to cut the cards myself would discourage me from buying a game, especially since I don't own a big paper cutter and I don't have quite that much faith in my ability with scissors.  I very much appreciated the effort that Jason and the rest at BPG put into cutting the Roach cards in advance.                        </div>

                            I've always felt that cutting the cards for the Roach was worth the effort for a better product, but it is a chore.  We're currently looking into taking advantage of the changes at <a href="http://www.rpiprint.com/" rel="nofollow">RPI</a> (where we've done all of our book printing) since their acquisition by <a href="http://www.us297.alphagraphics.com/" rel="nofollow">Alphagraphics</a>.  I'm told that they can handle our card order now (they couldn't before), but I've yet to see any specific details or examples of that.  I'm crossing my fingers.<br/><br/>Kuma, my recommendation would be that if you're thinking you might do a 100 copy print run of your book, go ahead and do 200.  IPR is currently  quoting us $453.65 for 100 copies of our 76 page book, and $605.31 for 200 copies.   If you only sell 100 - ever-  you've wasted maybe $150.  If you sell 200, you've saved around $300 (the difference on having to do another 100 copy run).                        </div>
