It is the only game (understanding that of course there are the likes of e.g. T&amp;T that also do this - I'm lumping them all together here) where I've seen gamism become truly complex, intelligent and adult in terms of challenges and their background.<br/><br/>In most games that purport to offer challenges, it's probably a simple rules-mechanical system that we're discussing. In last week's D&amp;D session I modeled the likely socio-psychological dynamics of the den of bandits we were about to ambush, and then constructed a ruse of war optimized to make it compelling to the specific audience. When the plan inevitably went extinct on contact with the enemy, we improvised like crazy, and managed to pull a victory of sorts, although my own character died to totally accidental combat attrition in the process.<br/><br/>The above sort of content is not available in other games. If it was, I might be interested. (And yes, I am interested in various clones and such, there are plenty of new ideas and content out there for this style of play.)<br/><br/>It should be noted that somebody who's played different games than me over the years probably experiences all this very differently. For example, if you've started roleplaying with D&amp;D in your teens, you probably have a very different relationship to this whole challenge-based gaming thing than I do. It suffices to say that my own early gaming was relentlessly artistic/immersive, so truly successful challenge-based gaming worthy of the name of wargame is pretty fresh for me. Not that I understand how somebody might not like this even if they did play it a lot in their teens, though - seems to me that it is very much my mature intellect and reading background that makes the game interesting, as I can draw upon everything between the heaven and earth to interact interestingly with the other players.<br/><br/>As for the mechanics and procedures, the game has plenty of these, and they work very well to achieve the above goals. I admit that the actual game texts are generally pretty sucky, but if you can get over griping about that and instead learn by mentoring or by reading very widely and experimenting on your own, it seems to me that it is reliable to discover an excellent game beneath all the cruft.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423870/#Comment_423870" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T06:06:29+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  6:06AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2013 6:10AM by lumpley.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure!<br/><br/>We're playing Dungeon Crawl Classics, in the funnel. This means that we each have 4 0-level characters on a dangerous adventure. "The funnel" refers to the idea that the survivors become our PCs, but having 4 0-level characters on an adventure that will kill them is a fun way to play even if they won't.<br/><br/>We've followed some bandits to their hideout in the woods, where something has gone clearly wrong. We don't have the details yet but it looks like some terrible monster has massacred the bandits and moved in. We'll deal with that later in the evening. For now, there's something weird in their yard, a tree stump with a squirrel on it but it ain't no normal squirrel. We investigate, and it's some kind of classic D&amp;D monster where a tentacled tree stump beast uses a squirrel-shaped lure to draw larger animals in as prey. Of course we find this out by getting too close to it. It kills, what, 3 of us? 4? Kills and eats us. We figure out (at some cost to life and precious lantern oil) that it doesn't mind being set on fire, and we waste many arrows and darts discovering that it'll take a lot more than our weapons to kill it. One of my characters, a dwarf, was its last victim, before we figured out that it was slow-moving and that as long as we kept a safe distance we'd be okay. Tragically, this character was the one who'd been carrying all our extra gear, since he had the encumbrance capacity and all. We had a quick debate about whether to try to dart in and grab his pack while the thing ate him, and decided it would be comical and not a good idea.<br/><br/>The fun in that game was high-color tactical play, where we (the players, not our characters) use our wits, our characters' surroundings, and our characters' meager resources to try to put off as long as possible the hilarious inevitable. <br/><br/>You know the kind of Odyssey of the Mind-esque puzzle game where you dump out your kitchen junk drawer and have to use its contents to build a tower that will hold an egg 12 inches off the table? It's fun in that same kind of way. The characters and all the fiddly little game mechanisms are like the corkscrew, the rubber bands, and the packet of coffee stirrers you have to build the tower with.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423871/#Comment_423871" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T06:16:25+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  6:16AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2013 6:20AM by lumpley.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Should I add? That game happened to be comical, but it's fun when it's grim and tense, too, and it's fun when comedy spikes the gravity or gravity spikes the comedy. It's the colorful tactical wits play that's fun, and you can dress it up lots of ways.<br/><br/>I understand that Eero personally likes to play so that the challenges the players face are all difficult but conceivably manageable, so he spends some time and care making sure that's so. I don't personally mind challenges that turn out to be impossible or easy, just as long as they're vivid, so that's where I spend my time and care.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423874/#Comment_423874" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T06:44:30+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  6:44AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2013 7:09AM by Judd.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have just started delving into the OSR stuff.<br/><br/>It is fun to see the games whose mechanics I didn't enjoy so much through AD&amp;D and AD&amp;D 2nd edition cleaned up, reorganized and put in a way that makes sense. The earlier editions and the Rules Cyclopedia were things that never hit my table, so I don't have any nostalgia for them but I like what I'm seeing, design-wise, from LotFP and Into the Odd. I'm intrigued by Whitehack and Stars Without Number.<br/><br/>I like the space it leaves for DM's to tinker, play and design. I'm enjoying tinkering with some <a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/lotfp-adventurer-and-salvage-union-of-marsui/" rel="nofollow">light setting stuff, making encounter tables and tables that make up monsters and their lairs </a>so I can make shit up and put it down on index cards during my train rides to and from work.<br/><br/>The guys I game with (two I've been gaming with since college and the other two since I was a wee 13 year old lad) are pretty used to being thrown into situations without an easy solution, with no game balance at hand, so they took to Lamentations of the Flame Princess pretty fast, using whatever resources they had at hand, bribing the City Guard to help them kick down a monster's door and when necessary, running like hell. I think they took to it through a combination of video game experience, Burning Wheel, boffer LARP's and me saying so at the table, asking them to roll up 3 characters to have one on hand in case one perishes.<br/><br/>The OSR stuff I dig has a good combination of color and utility, like <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/117257/Qelong" rel="nofollow">Kenneth Hite's Qelong</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6MR1KWIUR9UeUI4czl2TGhlTnM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Into the Odd's short but sweet PDF</a>, or the way <a href="http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/products/lotfp-weird-fantasy-role-playing" rel="nofollow">Lamentations of the Flame Princess</a> lays down setting expectations in spell and class descriptions.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423876/#Comment_423876" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T07:25:27+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  7:25AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the response so far!<br/><br/>FYI: Played Holmes D&amp;D first, then AD&amp;D, then found Traveller, Champions, and then everything exploded. My thinking in many ways has been affected by the years I spent at publishing companies who needed to make standardized rules for standardized setting books/adventures. I think that matters to my reaction to the flora and fauna of RPGs<br/><br/>It seems to me that part of the appeal is taking the simplicity of, say, the White Box, is that the GM/Group then begins adding to it to make it <i>their</i> world and <i>their</i> game. This is, of course, was the way it was done in the past. But before tournaments and such at conventions.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? Is that part of the fun as well? (Judd seems to imply as much for his play. And when it comes to LotFP, as Judd again suggests, the rules have been tailored to <i>that</i> world and that kind of experience with color. Which, of course, was the author's home system for home play.)<br/><br/>I came across an essay last night on the four Zen moments of OSR GMing (<a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?402972-The-Zen-of-Old-School-D-amp-D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?402972-The-Zen-of-Old-School-D-amp-D</a>):<br/>Rulings, Not Rules<br/>Forget Fair<br/>Heroic, not Superhero<br/>Game Balance is a Minor Factor<br/><br/>And I had this weird moment of going, "Oh, I think I understand Traveller now." Like, all the examples of skills in the book are really <i>examples</i>, and the tiny game system really is there just to make up rulings on the fly. And the Players will be using color and fiction to solve problems as much as anything else (as described in the posts above) and so on. Thoughts specifically on this from anyone? Or is the gonzo nature of fantasy RPG setting helpful or required to port of the fun and the execution of such play?<br/><br/>Also, where the heck does one buy LotFP? My google-fu is failing me.<br/><br/>Thanks again!<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423878/#Comment_423878" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T07:26:49+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  7:26AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with everything above. I will add that there is a certain joy in going back to old games (not just OSR games) and rediscovering (or discovering for the first time) gems of game design. Take, for instance, Moldvay Basic D&amp;D. Its procedures are tight and focused and its feedback mechanisms pave the way for incredible emergent gameplay. It doesn't tell you how you should play, but will relentlessly kill characters of players that don't adapt their actions to the environment created by the rules. As new players explore the environment of the game, you can actually see them becoming seasoned veterans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423880/#Comment_423880" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T07:36:03+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  7:36AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As new players explore the environment of the game, you can actually see them becoming seasoned veterans.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/interview-megan-mcferren-on-moldvay-dd/" rel="nofollow">Like Megan did</a>...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423881/#Comment_423881" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T07:37:37+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  7:37AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, where the heck does one buy LotFP?

They kick down doors and get treasure, marshal their resources and go back at it. At first the characters are really super-disposable but as the characters gain levels and the players gain dungeon-savvy, they become more durable and everyone at the table feels like they can actually invest in them.<br/><br/>All this time, the GM is making shit up, hacking at published things or things found online.<br/><br/>But at some point in the cycle, shit starts to change. The characters get land or start their own adventuring company or somehow or other invest in some corner of the world that they want to stake out as their own or whatever it is that they do and I think that is when shit becomes more character-driven. But my sense is that it takes a while to make sure this isn't just another first level character for the garbage heap and even a while after that. The investment and character to drive the action is forged at the table.<br/><br/>...or at least I think that might be how it goes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423886/#Comment_423886" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T08:09:54+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  8:09AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran slightly-modified Labyrinth Lord for my friends. LL is a Basic/Expert D&amp;D clone.<br/><br/>It was an attempt at a real sandbox setting, with a huge mountain range in the hinterlands of an uncolonized land. I used some game-mapping software to built the terrain, and I actually crafted the mountains and valleys and whatnot, so I knew the topography pretty well. I put a little effort into the ancient history of the region and sprinkled ruins and other evidence. I thought about the humanoid politics of the region and populated the area sparsely with tribes and villages. I dropped a human keep on the edge of the wilderness and tried to make it a comfortable base for the PCs.<br/><br/>The players at first didn't realize how dangerous the environment was, despite my warnings. Stephanie wasn't taking the game seriously, too. The group was more into character development than exploration and challenge. So table problems that ultimately killed the campaign. That said...<br/><br/>There was a lot of fun there! There were grisly moments when Stephanie's (first) character carelessly jammed her hand in a dark crevice to search for a lever to open a secret door, and a skeleton on the other side ripped her hand off and she bled out. There were triumphant moments as the group learned secrets of the ruins. There were exciting moments like when the party was in a pitch black cave -- the kind where you crawl around through tight cracks and stomp through waist-deep water, not the huge type where you take a defensive fighting formation -- and some weird octupus thing started strangling people. <br/><br/>The group was slowly learning how to survive. Brandon's first character died. His next was an extremely cautious wizard who never took risks he didn't have to take. Marc played an elf who kept out of trouble and gathered information before acting, but was willing to take calculated risks. A couple characters died, but it's so quick to make new characters in LL. They just rolled right in with new PCs.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423887/#Comment_423887" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T08:15:58+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  8:15AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because low-level characters are so fragile, it discourages a player from developing them much.

As characters were lost, players got discouraged. Stephanie didn't really even create a truly new character. She basically re-created the same one, as her sister, with the same themes (a ranger-type fighter with a pet dog) and the same reckless personality (that is more Stephanie's style than Stephanie's PC's style, frankly).<br/><br/>Some of the players were starting to "get it" (I was telling them outright from the start, but it was something they didn't want to believe, I guess). Some weren't. The ones who did get seem to get it weren't in love with it. They're not challenge-based gamers, not for the long haul.

The players explore this location, using their characters. The game doesn't care who your character is -- every element you have on your character sheet is a potential resource for exploring the location. Treasure is there to give you a reason to explore, traps and monsters are there to make it dangerous, and the town (or other civilized areas) are there so players can trade around the rewards they have collected from exploring.<br/><br/>That's the basics. What happens to the campaign after many sessions of play is up for grabs. At the start, PCs are interchangeable, ie the dungeon doesn't care which PCs go exploring. Players might get attached to their characters after many sessions, but the game doesn't. Whether or not the DM does is up to the DM. Maybe the game turns into a series of character-based quests or becomes political intrigue, but that's all add-on stuff that the DM (or the group) creates.<br/><br/>So, the basic "story" is dungeon-driven: some people explore a dangerous location.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423894/#Comment_423894" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T08:34:24+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  8:34AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I find most attractive in OD&amp;D/OSR play is its biggest similarity with <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>: that characters aren't something you develop beforehand, aren't really a player's decision to make, but sort of "happen", shaping up from the scars and bruises they collect as they survive adventures (<i>if</i> they do).

Of course it depends on the skillz, but I'd say that a moderately experienced DM (even just a half dozen sessions under his belt) can run your basic dungeon after a half an hour of prep. He just needs to download a small dungeon, do a quick overview (really, this is where experience mostly counts - an experienced DM can run a standard dungeon with no prep at all, just reading as they go), and then start play.<br/><br/>If you want to set up a sandbox campaign, the initial setup for what I'd consider a minimal beginning would take an hour if you know what you're doing. if you don't exactly, and need to read your initial adventure locations carefully in advance, then it might be something like two hours. A properly seeded sandbox will then run five session on its own before you need to pay it any more attention.<br/><br/>The above minimal numbers assume that you're not creating any original material yourself, and that either somebody is telling you in detail what to do (where to go for good 1st level dungeons, how to draw a map, that sort of thing), or you already know yourself. Really, the skills required to actually DM are much more of an issue than the time-investment, I think; you can't just spend more time in prep to compensate for lack of inspiration, for example.<br/><br/>Of course it seems to be something of a trend for DMs to be too ambitious with their campaign design. You can put hundreds of hours into it if you want to create everything yourself, and want to prepare massive detail. However, nothing in the game requires this, it's all additional investment that hopefully pays off for the DM who wants to do it.<br/><br/>Also, I don't blame anybody who thinks the above numbers absurd. The fact remains that the texts of the game are generally somewhat sucky, and they make things seem more difficult and time-consuming than they really are. I think you're better off looking for some OSR blogger's tutorial on "how to start my own sandbox" than the Mentzer explanation, for example; it's likely to be much more concise and elegant.\n<blockquote>For <i>all</i> players, though, the actual length of play looks like an issue: relative to my own fascination (to find out who these characters will become), play moves slowly and it will take a great many sessions to get anywhere of note \u2014 or that's the idea I got, anyway.</blockquote>\nThis I agree with, it is a sedately paced game. Or rather, perhaps I might say that you have to enjoy the minute details, for otherwise you'll grow bored before the big overarching considerations have time to emerge. The first three sessions or so of a new campaign are likely to go by without anything but simple dungeoneering, and it might go on much longer, all depending on where the players want to take it. Our big campaign in 2010-11 (a hundred sessions total before changing life circumstances ended it) took about ten sessions to mature into a fully-fledged sandbox thing, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423898/#Comment_423898" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T09:08:44+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  9:08AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                              First and fore-most (for me) is the nostalgia factor. As I <br/>type this I have, in front of my laptop ( a computer more <br/>powerful than the ones that controlled the first moon <br/>missions!) the Holmes edited Blue Book Dungeons and Dragons. <br/><br/>  That's where I started. Discovered in the back inside cover <br/>of this venerable tome was a computer punch card - back when <br/>computer information was stored on card-board; more <br/>specifically, the holes in said cards. On the back of this <br/>particular unpunched card is the hand written introduction to <br/>the first adventure I went on. It was penned by a friend of <br/>the family called Speedball (along with all that his nickname <br/>implies!). Frankly, they are a poorly written mess - both the<br/> punch-card introduction and the Blue Book rules BUT...<br/><br/>  ... I would rather run that version of D&amp;D than any other <br/>that came after it! And not just for nostalgia's sake. There <br/>is an "openness", a "permissibility" to the rules that only <br/>years later do I recognize. Example:<br/><br/>"You are sure to encounter situations not covered by these <br/>rules. Improvise. Agree on a probability that an event will <br/>occur and convert it into a die roll - roll the number and <br/>see what happens! The game is intended to be fun and the <br/>rules modified if the players desire. Do not hesitate to <br/>invent, create and experiment with new ideas. Imagination is <br/>the key to a good game. Enjoy."<br/><br/>  THAT should be the OSR mantra! THAT should be Rule 0! <br/>However, the 96,473 rules that were added in "Official TSR <br/>Products and Supplements" (accept no substitutes! - Gygax <br/>actually said that in 1st ed. AD&amp;D)  rule-lawered the fun out <br/>of the game for me. <br/><br/>Don't make me read "The Complete Book of Elves" . I AM an <br/>elf! I have attribute scores! <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> I'LL</span> tell <span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU </span> <br/>what an elf can do/know/sense/resist if you just pass me the <br/>d20.<br/><br/>  And that, Charlie Brown, is the true meaning of OSR (at <br/>least for me). That, and the beer and pretzels.<br/><br/>EDIT: I managed to save this last night when the site went down and I've been reading the responses with a certain glee - knowing what kind of responses the question of OSR would generate (both in their differences and in similarities). Gygax, himself, had some strong ideas about "story" in RPGs that would have surprised and confused a younger me.

Also, the huge amounts of random tables mean that occasionally everyone at the table, including me the GM, is surprised! My favorite DCC moment was when a dwarf in the party was messing with an enchanters table that he'd found in the dungeon. He was trying to create an herbicide to deal with the giant plants in a nearby room, and failed his roll. The enchanters table had a random table to roll on if you messed with it, so I did, and poof - a clone of the dwarf appeared. The player got one of the empty character sheets, copied their dwarf to it, and was no playing two identical dwarves who would diverge from that point on.<br/><br/>There are a lot of gonzo, crazy mechanics, and the fun came from seeing the ways it would shape and alter what's happening, and sometimes interpreting so that it made sense was fun too.<br/><br/>Also, it was really cool watching my players formulate a plan and see how it took shape and played out. They were crazy geniuses.<br/><br/>There wasn't much in the way of character driven story (and the moment there started to be I had to ruthlessly direct them back towards the dungeon). But there was a story! It was about these people who were once tax collectors and farmers turning into scarred, veteran weirdos and the crazy adventures they'd been on and the dangers they'd faced. The word I've heard used is "picaresque" and I think it's apt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423901/#Comment_423901" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T09:28:55+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  9:28AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As far as the games I've played go, your character's personality is just more fiddly bits to use as best you can to come out ahead as a player. If you care about character arcs or any, any, any lit 101 stuff, I'd choose a different game.</blockquote>\nI basically agree, but I'll also expand upon the point a bit: character personality can well matter in D&amp;D, and there are character arcs on a campaign level, but they're just not dramatic in nature. Both personalities and arcs are key ingredients in our particular style of sandbox play.<br/><br/>Consider the question of the good alignment: why ever burden yourself with something like that? The answer is simple: we are in fact not playing to solve and survive any arbitrary challenges, we are choosing the subject matter of our game to reflect our own interests. One of those interests might be the question of how a basically decent person might succeed and survive in the cruel world of D&amp;D. Playing a good character can, in other words, be a self-imposed handicap or framework within which the challenge occurs. The same goes for other matters of character personality: if your desire is to triumph within the constraints of your character's established nature, be it a sense of honor or greed or whatever, then this is very much a strategic and tactical constraint for you.<br/><br/>As for character arcs, your character's arc concerns the strategic goals you choose. In our campaign right now we have a character who's dedicated himself to curing a space-borne plague of alien slugs infesting a certain town, for example; he is, simultaneously, being hunted by a bloodthirsty redcap desiring revenge for past slights. Another character has sworn fealty to him as his servant, being a sort of Sancho Panza for his Don Quixote. He has an established headquarters with a library, laboratory and certain martial preparations in the capital of Bulgaria, and he recently hired an entire 1st-level adventuring party to go to Stonehell Dungeon to seek a supposed cure to this plague while he himself remains behind to treat the symptoms.<br/><br/>None of the above stuff arises from player desire for drama; it's all either necessary positioning, results of past choices or arbitrary fluff cum established fact. And of course all sorts of yarns can be created post facto about these antics, despite story-telling being of no concern when the events are actually in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423902/#Comment_423902" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T09:45:21+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  9:45AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423903/#Comment_423903" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T10:04:18+00:00" title="November  7, 2013 10:04AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's interesting.

The primer touts a principle called "Rulings, not Rules", which apparently means "everything in the game will be determined by arbitrary GM fiat". I'm not making that up. An actual quotation from the text is "Rules are a resource for the referee, not for the players." Another actual quotation, from the section for GMs, is "You are the rulebook. There is no other rulebook."<br/><br/>This conception of the GM as the all-powerful guy who gets to make all the decisions and can ignore the rules as much as he likes -- does that reflect the OSR movement as a whole? This is not a rhetorical question. I've read only this one document, and I'm curious.<br/><br/>(If so, how can you possibly make such a game work? It sounds like a recipe for unmitigated disaster. This principle seems, for instance, to be utterly incompatible with a second principle touted by the "Quick Primer for Old School Gaming": namely that the game is about player skill, not character skill. If the GM gets to decide everything, the only player skill that is left is "influencing the GM to make decisions favourable to you".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423906/#Comment_423906" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T11:06:24+00:00" title="November  7, 2013 11:06AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Victor: Well I, for one, don't consider myself beholden to that bit of text.

I just had the bad guys all make saving throws.  If they failed they fall off.<br/><br/>On the same boat was the gunner.  He was pretty badly wounded.  I was trying to figure out what to have him do.  Try and take a shot?  That seemed weird because his boat is being thrashed around.  Jump down and attack the PC?  That also seemed weird he was badly wounded.  Oh, I know!  I had him make a Morale check.  Yeah, he failed.  So I had him panic and jump off the boat.<br/><br/>Most situations have been about applying existent rules, and less about making up whole new rules.  Sure the whether something matters or not is up to me.  Whether something is worth a roll or bonus is up to me.  But I haven't really INVENTED new rules whole cloth.<br/><br/>There's also been a lot of what I call, "Is it bigger than a bread box?" rulings.  Which to say there's just a lot of decisions about how shit in this imaginary space world *works*.  How many cryotubes fit in an 80 ton cargo bay?  Do 600 year old vaults of confiscated maltech have inventory records?  Do the ships computers have maps of their home world?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423917/#Comment_423917" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T12:25:47+00:00" title="November  7, 2013 12:25PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2013 12:28PM by John_Harper.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is great.<br/><br/>A few thoughts:<br/><br/><b>- Character stories.</b> We played 55+ sessions of Stars Without Number, starting with 4 players and 12 characters. The game setup was "You have a starship. Here's the mission board where you can select jobs." The <i>action</i> of the game was 100% focused on the color-rich tactical play that Vincent and Eero described. But the emergent story of the game answered the questions, "Who are these people, really? What are their ethics and values? What do they really care about? How do they change the setting?" The best part, to me, is that none of us had to put any effort into that stuff. We played the challenge-based game to the hilt and the character stuff emerged as the natural accumulation of choices and consequences.<br/><br/>In other words, we didn't create fully-formed characters and then try to portray them. Instead, we created (partially) blank slates and then found out who they actually were once it was all over.<br/><br/>Also, the stable of characters meant that any one character wasn't critical to play. They could die, retire, or decide that their goals no longer aligned with the rest of the crew. We had one character simply walk away to pursue other interests. And another that fused with a piece of nanotech gear and then was essentially sold off to another ship for profit. In 1-to-1 character-to-player games, these decisions would be disruptive, but here they were simply interesting outcomes along the way.<br/><br/><b>- GM Prep.</b> I'm a very lazy GM. I never do prep if I don't have to. One thing I looooove about these OSR games is how easy they are to run. When I ran Moldvay and then World of Dungeons, I would just google up a dungeon before the session, print it out, and go. If they decided to fuck off and go somewhere else, a few minutes of googling and another print out and there was a whole other thing for them explore. There's an infinite pool of dungeon-y stuff to draw on.<br/><br/>With SWN and Kevin's other games, he gives you these excellent random-table content generators that can spit out the contents of an abandoned room, the values of an alien culture, or the side-effects of a pre-tech artifact at a moment's notice. You don't have to prepare anything in advance. Like Bret said, it's a surprise to everyone, including the GM. "What's in this guy's office? I don't know, let's see!" It's fast, effortless, and fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423918/#Comment_423918" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T12:56:13+00:00" title="November  7, 2013 12:56PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, your post is an illustration of the first half of that rules/ruling: you had information to choose from, but you made a ruling as to what kind of roll to make. A ruling of some sort had to be made.<br/><br/>The other half is the shift from. ASIC D&amp;D to LotFP. At some point, as the setting becomes more specific, I imagine the rules start changing -- slowly at first, and then more dramatically, to get the rules the GM needs to model the setting and actions of the characters.<br/><br/>My thinking is those two points are on a continuum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423919/#Comment_423919" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T13:00:10+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  1:00PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the rulings not rules issue, I think its intent is exactly what Eero, Judd and Vincent have described. Here's the <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fantasy Adventure Game Basic Rulebook</i>, p. B60 (Tom Moldvay, 1981):\n<blockquote><b>Dungeon Mastering as a Fine Art</b><br/>The success of an adventure depends on the DM and his or her creation, the dungeon. The DM should have the dungeon carefully mapped out before play begins. Even so, a DM will quickly find that it is impossible to predict every possibility. After all, there are several players, and only one DM! It is not unusual for players to find a solution, or pose a new problem, that the DM has not even thought of. It is very important for the DM to be <i>flexible</i>.<br/><br/>It is important that the DM be <i>fair</i>, judging everything without favoring one side or another. The DM is there to see that the adventure is interesting and that everyone enjoys the game. <b>D&amp;D is not a contest between the DM and the players!</b> The DM should do his or her best to act impartially when taking the part of monsters or handling disputes between characters.<br/><br/><b>"That's not in the rules!" </b>The players will often surprise the DM by doing the unexpected. Don't panic. When this happens, the DM should just make sure that everything is done in the order given by the outline or sequence of events being used. Minor details may be made up as needed to keep the game moving. All DMs learn how to handle both new ideas and unusual actions quickly and with imagination.<br/><br/>Quite often a DM can decide on a solution to a player's actions not covered by these rules. Other times, a problem may have no simple solution. One quick way for a DM to decide whether a solution will work is by imagining the situation, and then choosing percentage chances for different possibilities. For example, suppose the DM is running a combat that is taking place on a ledge next to an unexplored chasm. One player suddenly decides that his character has no chance to survive combat. The player announces "My character wants to jump into the chasm to escape!" There may be a chance that he will fall to a nearby ledge or land in a pool of water at the bottom of the chasm. The DM thinks about the dungeon for a minute, and remembers that an underground river flows through some of the lower dungeon levels, so there might be a pool below. Even so, the character will fall 60', and a normal fall will do 1d6 points of damage per 10' fallen. This character has only 7 hp, and seems likely to die even if the water cushions his landing and reduces the damage. However, there should always be a chance to do something nearly impossible. A player should have, at the very least, a saving throw or a stated percentage chance of a miraculous occurrence saving the character. The DM answers: "Looking down into the chasm, your character can estimate that he has a 98% chance of dying, no saving throw, if he jumps. If you decide your character jumps, roll percentage dice. A result of 99 or 00 will mean that your character lives, but any other result will mean that he will die in the attempt. Do you still want to jump?"<br/><br/><b>"There's always a chance."</b> The DM may want to base a character's chance of doing something on his or her ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and so forth). To perform a difficult task (such as climbing up a rope or thinking of a forgotten clue), the player should roll the ability score or less on ld20. The DM may give a bonus or penalty to the roll, depending on the difficulty of the action (-4 for a simple task to +4 for a difficult one). A roll of 1 should always succeed, and a roll of 20 should always fail.<br/><br/><b>"The DM is the Boss."</b> The DM decides how these rules will be used in the game. A good DM talks about problem areas with the players and considers reasonable requests by them. The players should realize, however, that the final decision is the DM's: not theirs, and not this booklet's! If a disagreement holds up play, the DM may make a temporary decision and talk it over with the players when the adventure is over. If a player disagrees strongly enough, he or she may quit the game. It is up to the DM to create an adventure the players can enjoy.<br/><br/><b>"Everyone is here to have fun."</b> The DM should make the adventure seem as "real" to the players as possible. All should avoid getting stuck in long discussions about rules or procedures. The game should move along with humor, as well as excitement.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423920/#Comment_423920" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T13:26:24+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  1:26PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>With SWN and Kevin's other games, he gives you these excellent random-table content generators that can spit out the contents of an abandoned room, the values of an alien culture, or the side-effects of a pre-tech artifact at a moment's notice.

They kick down doors and get treasure, marshal their resources and go back at it. At first the characters are really super-disposable but as the characters gain levels and the players gain dungeon-savvy, they become more durable and everyone at the table feels like they can actually invest in them.<br/>...<br/>But at some point in the cycle, shit starts to change. The characters get land or start their own adventuring company or somehow or other invest in some corner of the world that they want to stake out as their own or whatever it is that they do and I think that is when shit becomes more character-driven. But my sense is that it takes a while to make sure this isn't just another first level character for the garbage heap and even a while after that. The investment and character to drive the action is forged at the table.</blockquote>\nTheres's a truism I've heard to explain the situation: <br/><br/>"Your Backstory is all the stuff you do, and enemies you make, to get to fourth level; it hasn't happened yet."\n<blockquote>What I find most off-putting in OD&amp;D/OSR play, and in fact prevents me from running a game of my own, is the huge time-investment apparently assumed, compared to basically any other game I'm used to. DM-side, a dungeon scenario (ostensibly the "simplest" kind) consists of a large amount of drawings and written materials to prep; even when using an off-the-shelf "module" the amount of reading to do (and details to remember) feels substantial. For <i>all</i> players, though, the actual length of play looks like an issue: relative to my own fascination (to find out who these characters will become), play moves slowly and it will take a great many sessions to get anywhere of note \u2014 or that's the idea I got, anyway.</blockquote>\nI'm really curious how you got the impression creating a dungeon scenario was so labor-intense. Are you assuming all dungeons have to be as expansive as published ones?<br/><br/>I assure you, its easy and quick. Take a standard size sheet of paper. Crease it down the middle, short length. Now on one half sketch out a map. Rough squares for rooms, lines for corridors, any other quick notes you want to add. About a dozen chambers should be plenty for a single four hour session. Make it rough and schematic, not precise and detailed. Then on the other half, write a description of what's in each chamber, no more than a sentence or two long, the most important things about the room, not every possible detail. Most OSR systems have a process for generating contents for you if you need ideas. I roughly make a third of the chambers empty, one-sixth have a trap, one-sixth have unguarded resources, and a third have monsters.<br/><br/>I've never needed anything more for a game. Usually the players don't explore the whole thing before getting wiped out or withdrawing, so I can add to it or refine unused ideas between sessions. You don't need details or much pre-writing because all that will arise naturally during play. A dungeon is a framework for the characters actions, not the final product.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423924/#Comment_423924" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T13:49:32+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  1:49PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love that the games are fiction first, like AW! :-)<br/>I'm enjoying revisiting games of my youth, especially games like B/X D&amp;D that we sneered at compared to AD&amp;D. <br/>As GM I saw high emotions being generated at our table in a way that more modern games have not.

Now instead I just focus on running down the clock for the players - to force more wandering monster checks. Each time I roll a new monster then I imagine how to incorporate it given what I know about past events. Thus I don't have to worry about off-stage stuff, just what the players see. Its kinda like making a move in AW, its just I have to earn that move by bleeding the players of time (and hence everything else).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423925/#Comment_423925" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T13:58:59+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  1:58PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I love that the games are fiction first, like AW! :-)</blockquote>\nThere's a serious grain of truth in the idea that AW finally taught me how to play the games that frustrated me as a kid.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423926/#Comment_423926" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T14:04:06+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  2:04PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2013 2:13PM by E.T.Smith.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's an OSR Bundle of Holding right now, so I thought I'd read the free "Quick Primer for Old School Gaming" by Matthew Finch that is contained in it. The primer touts a principle called "Rulings, not Rules", which apparently means "everything in the game will be determined by arbitrary GM fiat". </blockquote>\nThat's a common misinterpretation of "Rulings not Rules." Its also unfairly reductionist to interpret it that way. Its not a statement denying narrative control, its about making a choice to entrust the smooth moderation of the scenario to the judgement of a fair-minded individual with just as much an investment in having a good time as everyone else, rather than a blind physics-simulator. Its about stepping away from 3E mindset (which leads to scenario short-circuiting rules-hacks and the cult of the character build, and something that OSR was directly contrasting when it started) to a more actual-play communal one, not keeping down players who may dare speak out of turn. In fact its arguably player-empowering since it gives them leave to try anything, rater than being limited to system-delineated options.<br/><br/>Here's the actual quote from the original essay, which on a full read is obviously about avoiding rules bloat, not fiat.\n<blockquote><b>First Zen Moment: Rulings, not Rules</b> <br/>The biggest key to understanding \u201cold school\u201d gaming is like a Zen moment: much of the time, you don\u2019t use a rule, you just use a ruling. It\u2019s easy to understand that sentence, but it takes a flash of insight to really \u201cget it.\u201d I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re going to have a flash of liking it. You might hate it. What I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s a big intuitive leap from modern games to understand how this works. The players can describe any action, without needing to look at a character sheet to see if they \u201ccan\u201d do it. The GM uses common sense or makes an ad-hoc ruling, and then the game moves on. This is why characters have so few numbers on the character sheet, and why they have so few specified abilities. Many of the things that are \u201cdie roll\u201d challenges in modern gaming (disarming a trap, for example) are handled by observation, thinking, and experimentation in old-style games. Getting through obstacles is more \u201chands-on\u201d than you\u2019re probably used to. <br/><br/>A simple example: by tradition, many pit traps in 0e are treated as follows. They can be detected easily, by probing ahead with a 10ft pole. If you step onto one, there is a 1 in 6 chance that the pit trap will open. And that\u2019s all there is to it. Thieves \u2013 if the game even uses thieves as a character class \u2013 don\u2019t spot them unless specifically checking, and they don\u2019t disarm. <br/><br/>Or say for instance you want your fighter to leap from a high ledge to the ground, both hands gripped tightly around the hilt of his sword to drive it deep into the back of the goblin below, who\u2019s about to club the party\u2019s cleric from behind. What do you do? You simply tell the referee what you want to do. Then the referee will probably ask you to roll to hit. If you hit, you do damage. You might even do extra damage because of your weight behind the blow. That will be for the DM to determine. If you are a ways off the ground you might have to check to see if you get hurt yourself \u2013 and maybe not, if you roll to hit well enough. On the other hand, the referee might decide that you automatically hit the goblin since you\u2019re attacking from behind and from above, but not give you extra damage. However the referee decides the exact die rolls and numbers, it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re going to have some sort of powerful attack here, even though you don\u2019t have a specific \u201cfeat\u201d or \u201cskill\u201d for this kind of maneuver written on your character sheet. </blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423927/#Comment_423927" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T14:09:16+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  2:09PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2013 2:12PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How John Harper and others have described how Characters begin somewhat blank but reveal themselves through play is how AW works, yes?

One of my players has been collecting the whole line and once in a while he'll pull a bit of information out of one of those books but that's mostly just "informed perspective" and not really getting into the extra systems those books provide.<br/><br/>As for the AW thing here are some of the concepts that are helping me run SWN:<br/><br/>The idea of having a GM Agenda.  SWN is pretty good about articulating what the GM should be thinking about and where his decision making should be coming from.<br/><br/>The idea of Hard Moves.  Rather than failed rolls resulting always in "that doesn't work" sometimes I introduce a follow up bit of fiction about how things are getting worse. <br/><br/>The idea of Fronts and Countdown clocks.  We're a year into play and there's A LOT of stuff out there in space.  It helps to take a moment and consider what happens "off screen" with this stuff and how it moves along when the PCs aren't dealing with it.  The Faction system in SWN helps with this A LOT but even inside individual adventures thinking about the various pieces being in independent motion from the PCs helps.<br/><br/>Setting TNs.  In this case I've caught a lucky break in that the SWN skill system lines up with AW Move system.  2d6 + mod with 7-9 being the expected range.  So generally when the PCs roll under 7 something bad happens.  7-9 I give the PCs the baseline of what they wanted and 10+ I give the PCs what they asked for plus a little more.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers" title="VictorGijsbers"><img alt="VictorGijsbers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers">VictorGijsbers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423933/#Comment_423933" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T14:54:52+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  2:54PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2013 3:05PM by VictorGijsbers.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            E.

If you read a little further, you'll see stuff like this, which is supposed to be an example of good old school GMing:\n<blockquote>John the Roguish: \u201cI don\u2019t see why I should be down on the ground.\u201d<br/>GM: \u201cYou rolled a 2, that\u2019s a crappy roll, you got tangled in your sword, and you\u2019re on the ground.

The rules assume that the things that happened to a PC before the start of play are important, and there is a default assumption that the PCs are probably existing in a place that is at least somewhat familiar to them.<br/><br/>OD&amp;D does not care who your character was before the game begins. Basic D&amp;D does not care who your character was before the game begins. AD&amp;D 2nd edition had some rules for creating a history for your character, I can't recall offhand if AD&amp;D 1st edition had them too, but they are all prep, decided during character creation. There is no asking questions during the game.<br/><br/>In old school D&amp;D you find out who your PCs are by playing them, quite literally.

Who your character *is* will only be found by what happens in play. The interesting part of your character's life simply hasn't happened yet.

The problem is it's several years old, and its now often being viewed out of context. People get sent to it as a "OSR 101", but it was originally directed specifically at players of 3E D&amp;D to advocate a different style of dungeon-delving.

You get a history, but it might only suggest as much as the name of a character class does. Later Traveller books gave you more granularity, more skills, and actual events that happened, but original is pretty sparse.<br/></blockquote>\nExcept that if you look at the example character in Trav Bk1 - every roll in char gen is interpreted and fleshed out with events, consequences, traits, NPCs, etc. IMO this is very much in the OSR style of random rolls leading to fiction being developed. The LBBs do not tell you to do this but they show you how it is done. This could be a weakness in the text or it could be that it is up to you to decide if this approach is right for a particular character/game. Now I'll be the first to admit that I never saw it this way in the 80s, I just thought that it was a fancy example for the text! However there is a strong parallel between this "rich" character generation method and the world generation method which explicitly tells you to use the random rolls to stimulate your imagination and fill in the blanks/extrapolate from what you roll.<br/><br/>In terms of LBB backstory coolness, I've seen nice ideas recently whereby the world generation rules are first used to generate a character's homeworld, with some brainstorming, then do char generation, with brainstorming and any time you need a world use the world generation rules again, place them on the subsector map etc, etc. By the time you get to the end of generating all the characters you'll probably have a full subsector sandbox. <br/><br/>With regards to Christopher's original question comparing SWN and Trav, well SWN has levels and Trav doesn't. That was always something that I liked about Trav but obviously lots of people like levels. I certainly think that if you re-read Bk0 then the "making stuff up at the table" is strongly supported by the text. I actually didn't understand it back then but I think I do now. I totally agree that AW has helped me understand how these old games were supposed to work (and made me want to run them again). Although I did do a Trav-AW hack because AW is faster to play and has more hooks for generating fiction collaboratively at the table.

And yes, future iterations of Traveller all expanded on building out the character background (and the geography of space!).<br/><br/>But if I were to run Traveller today, I'd blow off any concerns about the background elements. That one example aside (an attempt, in my view, to make the generated cool on the face of it, because it's hard to explain the character will be cool later on), the rules simple create a force of action that will become somebody interesting <i>because</i> he's now roaming as a free agent amid the stars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423952/#Comment_423952" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-08T06:39:21+00:00" title="November  8, 2013  6:39AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The huge voids in content are the biggest asset in original Traveler, very much in the spirit of original D&amp;D.

Now I'm kind of curious as to what the impetus for that section in the original book was, and why it was written in that particular way.</blockquote>\nLet's remember we have no dea of the order of character creation and these details.<br/><br/>Was Jamison's back history written up for the book simply as a way of making the character creation example more colorful? Was Jamison Marc Miller's favorite PC from when they were in the office at GDW play testing Traveller and he decided to gussy him up when honoring him with his own page in the book? Or was he just trying to prove that the character creation system wasn't just a bunch of abstracts? For all we know no one at GDW had ever bothered to do this with any character before.<br/><br/>As a side note, I just re-read those pages. While each roll on the character creation table is given a justification (or maybe a justification: "possibly a pirate raid" is not very definitive!) there are no mentions of NPCs, other worlds, specifics of cultures, his past before service, or anything other than fairly vague and innocuous color details justifying failure or success on the tables. In other words, there's really *nothing* in all that text that tells us any more than the rolling of the dice told us when we were rolling the dice.<br/><br/>I honestly think it's there to illustrate the color logic of the character creation system. But, in truth, it's no more revealing than the fact that somehow a Magic-User in OD&amp;D learned how to cast magic missile -- but we don't concern ourselves too much with if he was self-taught or had a mentor or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423968/#Comment_423968" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-08T11:19:14+00:00" title="November  8, 2013 11:19AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Something that just occurred to me:<br/><br/>In a game like this (by which I mean OD&amp;D-ish), the spell list (and the order in which the spells are available) really does a lot to set the tone and the implied setting of the world!<br/><br/>It's a bit like the military background of Traveller character creation and the fact there is the chance to have a Noble status.

It's the same with equipment lists in LotFP, for example. We make a lot of assumptions about the tech and culture from that. <br/><br/>In terms of Traveller, there are fusion weapons AND slug throwing rifles. Why? It implies that a wide range of tech is scattered across the stars, which begs the GM and players to come up with reasons.

Anyone can step into that position with a prepared scenario without a need for continuity. Jerry ran his "Rockknife Chasm" for the last few weeks, but he can't make it or just wants to play his Fighting-Man for a while, so Tom pitches his "Trollspit Tower" to the players, or maybe they'd rather go with Spike's "Pirates Port" town location. Its all still the same campaign.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nRight now, I'm at the preliminary stages of planning an OS game night, and I'm awfully glad you guys mentioned this stuff.<br/><br/>I'm starting to think that this style of group organization may actually be the most functional form of running OSR stuff. After all, this is the situation that the game itself comes out of ( big pool of players, big pool of GMs, casual drop in play, one night= a session/delve).<br/><br/>I suspect that some of the changes in RPG play preferences/styles comes exactly because home-players during the big D&amp;D boom of the late 70s/early 80s were not organizing this way, but playing with small, consistent at home groups as much as any urge to be more epic and Tolkienesque. That change may also be the source of at least some of the unhappy/dysfunctional play I mentally associate with these early games.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423974/#Comment_423974" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-08T12:38:02+00:00" title="November  8, 2013 12:38PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2013 1:12PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In terms of organizing theses games, everyone who hasn't yet might want to take a look at Ben Robbins' West Marches game...<br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423976/#Comment_423976" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-08T13:15:27+00:00" title="November  8, 2013  1:15PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            West Marches is deeply inspiring to me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423978/#Comment_423978" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-08T13:33:43+00:00" title="November  8, 2013  1:33PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am running <i>Torchbearer </i> in a way inspired by all this.

I wrote a review once (my only review ever) that described SWN's mechanics as "Red Box D&amp;D with Traveller skills". But it's perhaps equally valid or more so to describe the system as "Traveller with Red Box combat".<br/><br/>Yeah, it's got classes, hit points, and levels. The primary point of them is the skill points (and powers for the psychics) - high-tech weapons are sufficiently lethal that the extra hit points only help slightly - players will still be working *hard* to avoid fights, as in Traveller. I like the leveling system better than the rather vague skill advancement of the LBB. All experience is through acquiring credits, giving players the same adventuring motivation as most Traveller groups.<br/><br/>The rest of the game - planet building, ship building, actual play - feels very much like Traveller, though the planet-building is simpler (and faster), discarding much of the boring details in favor of generating *interesting* ones which can act as story hooks. <br/><br/>The biggest differences in feel are the prevalence of psychics (optional in the LBB as I recall, but a core class in SWN), and the lack of a galaxy-spanning empire - there *used* to be one, but it failed when the jumpgates died, and humanity on various worlds is crawling back into space centuries later with much slower (Traveller-speed) stardrives.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423995/#Comment_423995" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-09T08:48:24+00:00" title="November  9, 2013  8:48AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2013 9:01AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the first page of the Referee Book for <i>Lamentations of the Flaming Princess</i> I found this:<br/><br/><i><b>"The only important thing is to have an ethic behind your decisions, an overarching idea, and not just randomly squirm around in your running of a game."</b></i><br/><br/>Which immediately made me think of Agendas and Principles from Apocalypse World. (I'm not in any way saying Raggi was influenced by AW.) One more set of lessons that Vincent made explicit in AW.<br/><br/>I think this goes to something I thought a lot about while I was working on Play Sorcerer: These games don't just run themselves because they're bound between two covers. You actually need to know what you want to do with the game, arcing play toward those agendas; you need to know, as a GM, what you want to bring to the Players. Without that, you're just free-floating around.<br/><br/>I think something that happened with the Publishing Machine of 80s/90s was the promise to consumers that if they bought the games -- and all the additional splats/source books/adventures the games would just "work." But the truth is something the early players, adrift on their own, had to sort out: "What do we want to do with this stuff?" And then, after that, "How do we make that happen?"<br/><br/>I think OSR demands and acknowledges ownership of these decisions by the people at the table. It never assumes that "buying stuff" is going to provide a good time.<br/><br/>[Non-OSR Side Note: I've been posting, and will continue posting, the material I generated for <i>Play Sorcere</i>. <br/>I don't think I have the time to whip it into a book. But I did write lots of words. <br/>You can find the material on the <a href="http://playsorcerer.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">Play Sorcerer blog</a>. Click on the "Play Sorcerer" tag to pull up the text. It pretty much is as I typed it a while back. I'll be making a few tweaks along the way in light of <i>Annotated Sorcerer</i>.

Then came a long hiatus, and I got back into RPGs about five years ago but through stuff like Burning Wheel, FATE, In A Wicked Age, Fiasco, Dungeon World \u2026 no D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I read the "Primer On Old-School Gaming" recently and its Zen Moments were all "well, duh" to me. Deeply obvious. I had to <i>reverse</i> them to derive what current 3e/4e/Pathfinder games must be like to play \u2014 and yeah, it sounds dull to have everything covered by the rules and not just be able to try anything. So I can see why people who've tired of that would find OSR games refreshing.<br/><br/>But after buying the OSR Bundle Of Holding this week, I'm pretty disappointed by the actual game rules, since they preserve all the things I (in retrospect) found deeply crappy about old D&amp;D. Major issues for me include:<br/><br/>* Randomly rolling characters. This I just find lame. It's all too easy to end up with a crippled (or over-powered) character, and having no input into your character's basic type inhibits roleplaying. In practice, what we all did back in the day was sit around and roll up a few dozen stats blocks, then pick the one we wanted. At that point you might as well just be choosing your stats, as all modern D&amp;D-type games seem to have you do.<br/><br/>* Lookup tables. One of the worst holdovers from the game's wargaming roots. Having to page through the book to find a table, then trace through it to find the right cell, is a real drag and slows down the game.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what these games provide \u2014 other than nostalgia and the pleasure of deliberately mastering something clunky \u2014 that you can't get in better form from modern dungeon-themed rulesets like Dungeon World, Old School Hack or Dungeonslayers. (DS in particular seems very much like what OD&amp;D would be like if it were reinvented today.)<br/><br/>I hope this doesn't offend anyone, but it kind of reminds me of hipsters riding fixie bicycles. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423997/#Comment_423997" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-09T11:23:04+00:00" title="November  9, 2013 11:23AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I forgot \u2014 one old-school game I never really got a chance to play, but would be curious to, is <i>The Fantasy Trip</i>. This was Steve Jackson's first RPG, which he lost the rights to and later rebuilt in bloated form as GURPS. It grew out of a tiny, fun and quick tactical-combat game published as <i>Mel\xe9e</i> and <i>Wizard</i>, which he then expanded into a full roleplaying system. It had some nice characteristics like point-buy stat generation and quick, exciting combat.<br/><br/>Unfortunately TFT came out right before I graduated high school, and I never got a chance to play more than one session of it. The game itself died a year or two later when the publisher went out of business and literally disappeared; the rights are still in limbo. As I said, Steve Jackson rewrote it later, but it came out as GURPS, a different thing entirely.<br/><br/>A few years ago I managed to dig up PDFs of the books, and it still looks pretty neat. I understand there were some mechanical issues (like having Strength doubling as hit-points and as wizards' mana) but people have house-ruled workarounds for them. It'd be neat to see a reworking of this game join the OSR.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423998/#Comment_423998" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-09T11:27:35+00:00" title="November  9, 2013 11:27AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm not sure what these games provide \u2014 other than nostalgia and the pleasure of deliberately mastering something clunky \u2014 that you can't get in better form from modern dungeon-themed rulesets like Dungeon World, Old School Hack or Dungeonslayers.

The specific reasons have been discussed in length here and elsewhere, too. I'd say that if the games you mention actually did accomplish the things I'm looking for in D&amp;D, I'd be playing them. As it is, the particular virtues (especially the high stakes, clear goal-orientation and fiction-first resolution system) are simply not present in these specific titles you mention, which makes them unsuitable for this purpose, fine games as they are otherwise.<br/><br/>Not that I disagree with the sentiment that D&amp;D could use mechanical streamlining. Fortunately we're getting a stready stream of new texts that slowly update the game in terms of usability, while retaining the aspects of it that are so unique. I mean, it's not like you need to be stuck with the look-up tables and whatnot; my own house rules get rid of all that cruft, and I understand that most other groups play with heavy streamlining as well, tricking the system to perfectly reflect their own mechanical aesthetics. I don't feel like I'm playing a game any older or clumsier than Dungeon World when I'm playing my house-ruled D&amp;D - even if the game's original edition was published a decade before I was born, this particular campaign is still a contemporary of Vincent Baker's just as much as any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424000/#Comment_424000" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-09T12:07:16+00:00" title="November  9, 2013 12:07PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>* Lookup tables.

And your hipster irony thing. And well, really... all of it.<br/><br/>Clunky rules? Dump them. Keep the parts that help. This is one of the things that impresses me about <i>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</i>. It's lean, while still leaving the breathing space I'd love from a more challenge-based exploration game.<br/><br/>And if someone is loving <i>Swords &amp; Wizardry</i>, more power to them. I think it might be too clunky for me. But as others have said several times on this thread, there's no single OSR kind of game or play. That has to be kept in mind all the time. It's a very broad term, used for a range of kinds of play and a variety of rules sets. <i>Dungeon Craw Classics</i> is not <i>Lamentation of the Flame Princes</i>... and that's <i>good.</i><br/><br/><br/>To dig deeper, the thought that <i>Dungeon World</i> has anything to do with playing an OSR-styled game is.... well, weird. I've played DW. I've DM'ed it. And I can tell you, I really don't get it. It's Apocalypse World stripped of the things I find interesting about AW. <br/><br/>In OSR the GM strikes the Players with problems that hit the mechanics they have on their character sheets <i>obliquely</i>. The rules they have at their disposal might or might not be the best solution, and certainly not be the one they choose to employ. The Problem --&gt; Rules Mechanics --&gt; Solution gears are always engaged cleanly and smoothly in DW. Not so in OSR.<br/><br/>As my very smart friend put it in a recent email exchange, "DW isn't a challenge based game. It is not about giving them challenge with no clear solutions (hint in DW your moves give you solutions). OSR D&amp;D is very much challenge based, and you can rock that by giving the players little in the way of rules to use. Rules cannot solve a problem, they need come up with their own solutions and get lucky with the dice."<br/><br/>I'm glad lots of people like <i>Dungeon World</i>. <i>Really!</i> I'd rather people have a good time than a bad time. And if people are having a good time with DW, that's great. But "Going into a dungeon with a Cleric" doesn't make DW the same <i>experience</i> of play as <i>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</i>. Color alone does not make <i>experience</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers" title="VictorGijsbers"><img alt="VictorGijsbers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers">VictorGijsbers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424013/#Comment_424013" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T04:38:56+00:00" title="November 10, 2013  4:38AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't really expect this to happen, but this thread has made me quite eager to play or run an OSR game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424020/#Comment_424020" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T10:21:13+00:00" title="November 10, 2013 10:21AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, that analysis of the differences between Dungeon World and old-school D&amp;D doesn't really ring true for me.

Because that's an important distinction <i>for me</i> in separating the two styles and moving between them.<br/><br/>Also, in a weird reversal of PCs vs players emphasis, in D&amp;D only characters get turns, not players. If you have six characters, you get six turns. In DW, you get a turn for being a player, whenever it seems appropriate.

I think a couple folks have said that early too. You have a minimal rule set or one that's intentional vague on what to do with and a game comes together from all the interactions at the table. This is similar to building your D&amp;D game from World of Dungeons and explicitly adding in moves, Agendas, Principles, etc...<br/><br/>That DIY thing is another great point. Your house rules and/or favorite way to run a game is made available to a larger audience. There is all kinds of craziness as people are pushing and breaking boundaries in the OSR spheres.  <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424034/#Comment_424034" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T16:42:16+00:00" title="November 10, 2013  4:42PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2013 5:22PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a point that I don't think can be echoed enough.<br/><br/>Over on the LotFP site's forum, <a href="http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/discussion/topic/203/vanilla-is-good-but-there-are-countless-other-good-flavors-too/" rel="nofollow">Geoffrey McKinney posted</a>: <br/><br/><i>The 1974 D&amp;D rules have a specific flavor to them, which I will here refer to as "vanilla".<br/><br/>The various versions of A/D&amp;D through the decades (as well as their support products) have not travelled far from 1974 in terms of flavor. Thus we have "French vanilla", "vanilla bean", "vanilla with nuts", "vanilla with chocolate syrup", "vanilla with ______", etc.<br/><br/>Consider: "This setting has crusty dwarves who have wars with goblins who have chests full of gold and elves living in forests with dragons flying overhead while regenerating trolls live in caves and every town has a cleric to heal people and magic-users will zap you with fireballs and etc."<br/><br/>I just described almost every published D&amp;D product. Those that supposedly "innovate" from that merely A) add more stuff to that mix ("...plus laser guns and crashed spaceships and robots!"), and/or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> give the above mix some twists ("In this campaign, elves live in the desert and ride anhkhegs.").<br/><br/>The only two publishers that I know of who are giving us actual innovation are Lamentations of the Flame Princess and Goodman Games (with their forthcoming DDC RPG and with James Raggi's Random Esoteric Creature Generator).<br/><br/>Ever since the 1970s, people have typically failed to distinguish between A) the D&amp;D game and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> the sample playing pieces included with the game. Just about every D&amp;D product is full of monsters from the standard lists, magic items from the standard lists, spells from the standard lists, and etc. I think that shows a reticence to really unleash the imagination.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, all of the D&amp;D monsters, magic items, and spells are merely suggestions/options/examples. I chucked all but 6 of the standard monsters from Carcosa, and I dumped ALL of them from Isle of the Unknown. All the standard magic items are absent from both those products, as well as all the spells and even magic systems. Demi-humans aren't there, either. All gone!<br/><br/>The bedrock, the basis of the game is pretty much the standard character generation system for making a human fighter, plus the rules for him to operate: to hit, saving throws, etc. And I think that's it. Even the equipment lists and prices are merely options. Everything else is wide-open for the referee to make as he wills.<br/><br/>By perceiving all these options as necessities, all too many people will say, "Yeah, but without magic missiles/orcs/dwarves/you-name-it, it just isn't D&amp;D anymore!" Which is like saying, "If it's not some kind of vanilla, then it just isn't ice cream anymore!"<br/><br/><b>I have as my authorities the very highest: Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.<br/><br/>They write at the beginning of the 1974 D&amp;D rules under "Scope": "DUNGEONS and DRAGONS will provide a basically complete, nearly endless campaign of all levels of fantastic-medieval wargame play. Actually, the scope need not be restricted to the medieval; it can stretch from the prehistoric to the imagined future..."<br/><br/>Then, on the very last page of the rules in the "Afterward": "We urge you to refrain from writing for rule interpretations or the like unless you are absolutely at a loss, for everything herein is fantastic, and the best way is to decide how you would like it to be, and then make it just that way!"</b><br/><br/>Wow.<br/><br/>D&amp;D can have any setting whatsoever, from the prehistoric to the farthest of futures. And YOU decide (based on your whim alone) how EVERYTHING will be.<br/><br/>That's from Gygax and Arneson in January 1974.<br/><br/>It's too bad that those three sentences have been basically ignored by virtually all publishers of D&amp;D material. There is enough published D&amp;D stuff (of all the vanilla variations) to last anyone 20 lifetimes. I for one have no desire to see another orc or another +1 sword. I want to reach back to the exhortations in the 1974 rules and have some really imaginative stuff published.<br/><br/>So I am very thankful for Lamentations of the Flame Princess and for Goodman Games. They are driving the OSR truck through unexplored terrain rather than keeping to the safe, well-trodden paths.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with vanilla ice cream. Just don't neglect all the other flavors. I occasionally play a game of vanilla D&amp;D, but most of my D&amp;D games are of various other flavors. Variety is the spice of life!</i><br/><br/>I've been reading James' adventures for <i>Lamentation of the Flame Princess</i> and loving them. So much so I've been thinking, "I'd love to run these for my friends."<br/><br/>And then I had to think, "No. This is James' take on this kind of material. What would <i>mine</i> be? What would <i>I</i> bring to the table no one else would?"<br/><br/>Please note, in James's current campaign there are no demi-humans. It seems like he'll be gutting Clerics soon as well. In order to make the setting he wants (an alternate history of 17th century Europe with dark horrors, as far as I can tell.)<br/><br/>So, yes. Gygax and Arneson years exhorted everyone to build their own rules and settings and situations. No boxed sets. No recreation the "Vanilla" dungeon crawl again and again. But to take the foundations of interactions with problems and challenges for players via their characters, and through color and fiction, see how it all turns out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424035/#Comment_424035" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T16:49:28+00:00" title="November 10, 2013  4:49PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally.

One simplistic continuum is character vs. adventure focus.  In a character-focused game, the camera (if you will) follows the characters, whatever happens to them, whereas an adventure-focused game, characters can become unable to participate through infirmity (or death).  In the one, you use the adventure as a highly malleable environment used to reveal things about the characters; in the other, you use characters as replaceable probes to explore the adventure.<br/><br/>The difference comes up when the two diverge - in low-level D&amp;D, if you run out of hit points, you croak and make another character.  In Burning Wheel, if you're horribly injured, you play out Touching the Void, the tale of how you crawled back to camp with two broken legs.<br/><br/>In decades past, I spent a lot of time trying to play character-focused games using adventure-focused mechanics.  When I came across Burning Wheel, it blew my mind because it was the first system that really went out of its way to hit that explicitly - the GM was deliberately crafting challenges to reveal the characters, through their choices.<br/><br/>So, amazing as this has been, there's something that seemed to fall by the way side in my gaming, which was the verisimilitude of the world at an out-of-character level.  Sure the world is rich and detailed, but the lens of game play starts to feel like a stage the PCs live on, everything else brought on like a prop as needed, and so often created on a just-in-time basis, and so often just a shade too coincidentally appropriate or awesome.<br/><br/>I say OOC verisimilitude because while the characters certainly had to take the world at face value, the players don't.  The players know that if they go left, that's where the awesome stuff (both good and bad) is most likely going to be.  There's no real need to do (god forbid) actual reconnaissance, because Touching the Void result of having no plan is just as awesome as Conquering Templars.<br/><br/>I started to crave player planning!  I wanted players to be making intelligent plans about how to deal with the reality of the world around them, at a campaign goal level.<br/><br/>Right at this point the Torchbearer playtest landed in my lap, and I got what I was looking for unexpectedly.  Torchbearer is fascinating because while you can structure the adventure in a just-in-time way, the rules leap out of the book and confront players with a concrete, unavoidable logistical challenge.  Suddenly, players were asking me to hold off on my description of what's next, because they needed a minute to reorganize their gear and roles (who's taking point, who's got the light, etc.)  So awesome!<br/><br/>It's still not at a session-planning level, but anyways, that's one illustration of a difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

One thing about making D&amp;D your own is making up tables like this that imply a very odd setting. In our games there are no humanoid monsters at all. Everything on the random monster tables are something truly monstrous or dead. <br/><br/>The AD&amp;D dungeon stocking tables are amazing. You get a bunch of interesting detail out of a minimal set of words.

However this:\n<blockquote>I think this goes to something I thought a lot about while I was working on Play Sorcerer: These games don't just run themselves because they're bound between two covers. You actually need to know what you want to do with the game, arcing play toward those agendas; you need to know, as a GM, what you want to bring to the Players. Without that, you're just free-floating around.<br/><br/>I think something that happened with the Publishing Machine of 80s/90s was the promise to consumers that if they bought the games -- and all the additional splats/source books/adventures the games would just "work." But the truth is something the early players, adrift on their own, had to sort out: "What do we want to do with this stuff?" And then, after that, "How do we make that happen?"</blockquote>\n...is either really spot on or really off base.  This is exactly what the Theme/Tone section of every White Wolf game was trying to get at. But maybe people ignored those sections and just thought buying another book would work.  Or maybe the supplements promised something that contradicted the core books.  But yeah, this is hugely important to any game with even a slightly broad scope - another way to put it is "any good game".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424064/#Comment_424064" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-11T12:34:22+00:00" title="November 11, 2013 12:34PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fuseboy, I loved that post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gordon" title="Gordon"><img alt="Gordon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gordon">Gordon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424067/#Comment_424067" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-11T17:45:04+00:00" title="November 11, 2013  5:45PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So wait, which wargames are you thinking of here?</blockquote> Well, <i>Chainmail</i>, obviously, and the whole era of historical miniatures rules and hex-and-chit Avalon Hill/SPI games.

It seems entirely reasonable to me to believe that a "the chart is important, dude!" attitude may spring in part from older wargames.<br/><br/>I'm NOT saying that's a good thing, or a bad thing, necessarily, but again - good or bad, one thing it's certainly NOT is a refutation of "not keeping up."

I played in a PF campaign where the GM changed what you got XP for, didn't balance encounters at all, and you had to get in and out of the dungeon within a single session each time.<br/><br/>It died, for a variety of reasons I don't fully understand, but which included a shift to what I consider a more traditional approach where the GM presented threats and we had to deal with them, rather than having the freedom to set our own goals in the dungeon. But before then, it really had a lot of old-school goodness, married to the not-insane math of Pathfinder.<br/><br/>And as for DW: I think, yeah, it does take out some of the interesting things of AW. But it replaces them with OSR-style dungeon exploration. The GM can play that up more or less, of course, depending on stylistic preferences, but to me the fiction-first mechanics outweigh the presence of bonds.<br/><br/>I think there's somewhat more merit to the argument that DW is not "truly" old-school because of the ability to solve problems directly, with the moves. Note, though, that many DW discussions revolve around the (many) times in-game when a direct application of a move simply isn't available. I think GMing really strictly about when, for example, you have enough leverage to Parley or a good enough weapon to Hack and Slash, can lead to a more old-school feeling.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424106/#Comment_424106" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-12T15:46:12+00:00" title="November 12, 2013  3:46PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Location-based adventures</b> <br/>OSR and DitV<br/><br/>So if you grab DitV and look at the Town creation rules and then look at some of the best location based OSR stuff.

And James Raggi is explaining all this stuff to me about the need to track time (track time!) in the dungeon and how random encounters should be set up to work effectively and keeping track of torches and whatnot...<br/><br/>And it's really good. Like, for the first time, I got how to build and use a dungeon <i>on purpose</i>. Cause even back when I picked up AD&amp;D I was arcing more toward story/lit 101 stuff. And today I'm all like, "Oh, this is how all these pieces fit together in a way that make sense."<br/><br/>So then, as an experiment, I start leafing through old Classic <i>Traveller</i> LBB Adventures ("Across the Bright Face," "Marooned," and so on...) And they all talk about the need to keep track of time, and so on... <br/><br/>And this light bulb goes off. Because when I was in high school the <i>Traveller</i> adventures confused the hell out of me because I couldn't see how they'd be fun, but now: <br/>a) I  see how the <i>Traveller</i> modules are supposed to work now; and <br/>b) I realize why I never could before -- because the setting of <i>Traveller</i> was so narratively rich for me (I wanted <i>Dune</i>, not <i>Star Wars</i>) that the module adventures seemed so lifeless and stale. But now I see how they're not stale at all, because of this:\n<blockquote><blockquote>If you want, but not needed, can anyone compare the fun to different kinds of fun from games of the last decade that you love, but doesn't scratch the same itch that the OSRs do?</blockquote>\nThis I can do.  One simplistic continuum is character vs. adventure focus.  In a character-focused game, the camera (if you will) follows the characters, whatever happens to them, whereas an adventure-focused game, characters can become unable to participate through infirmity (or death).  In the one, you use the adventure as a highly malleable environment used to reveal things about the characters; in the other, you use characters as replaceable probes to explore the adventure.<br/><br/>The difference comes up when the two diverge - in low-level D&amp;D, if you run out of hit points, you croak and make another character.  In Burning Wheel, if you're horribly injured, you play out Touching the Void, the tale of how you crawled back to camp with two broken legs.<br/><br/>In decades past, I spent a lot of time trying to play character-focused games using adventure-focused mechanics.  When I came across Burning Wheel, it blew my mind because it was the first system that really went out of its way to hit that explicitly - the GM was deliberately crafting challenges to reveal the characters, through their choices.<br/><br/>So, amazing as this has been, there's something that seemed to fall by the way side in my gaming, which was the verisimilitude of the world at an out-of-character level.  Sure the world is rich and detailed, but the lens of game play starts to feel like a stage the PCs live on, everything else brought on like a prop as needed, and so often created on a just-in-time basis, and so often just a shade too coincidentally appropriate or awesome.<br/><br/>I say OOC verisimilitude because while the characters certainly had to take the world at face value, the players don't.  The players know that if they go left, that's where the awesome stuff (both good and bad) is most likely going to be.  There's no real need to do (god forbid) actual reconnaissance, because Touching the Void result of having no plan is just as awesome as Conquering Templars.<br/><br/>I started to crave player planning!  I wanted players to be making intelligent plans about how to deal with the reality of the world around them, at a campaign goal level.<br/><br/>Right at this point the Torchbearer playtest landed in my lap, and I got what I was looking for unexpectedly.  Torchbearer is fascinating because while you can structure the adventure in a just-in-time way, the rules leap out of the book and confront players with a concrete, unavoidable logistical challenge.  Suddenly, players were asking me to hold off on my description of what's next, because they needed a minute to reorganize their gear and roles (who's taking point, who's got the light, etc.)  So awesome!<br/><br/>It's still not at a session-planning level, but anyways, that's one illustration of a difference.</blockquote>\nWhich then led me to realize that <i>Traveller</i> that's already been published is something I'd love to play (and always wanted to) and now I could see how to make it world. Because it's all about the Players getting to poke and prod this strange environment that might get their characters killed. It's going to do exactly what fuseboy is talking about in spades (If I GM'd I'd have the PCs building a merc ticket, playing out the shenanigans, seeing how it rolls, and so on). <br/><br/>But there's also the <i>Traveller</i> in my head I've always wanted. This version is all supported inspiration and genre-wise less by SF tales than by certain kinds of crime/adventure fiction of well trained men placing big bets on bad odds mixing it up at the frontier edge of an Interstellar Empire: <br/><br/><i>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre<br/>The Man Who Would Be King<br/>The Wages of Fear<br/>A Fistful of Dollars<br/>The Magnificent Seven<br/>Kiss Me Deadly<br/>The Killing<br/>Heat</i><br/><br/>That game might work with Classic <i>Traveller</i>. But that might be well served by hacking the setting and style I want <i>Apocalypse World</i>. But at least now I see the distinct paths in front of me more clearly than before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers" title="VictorGijsbers"><img alt="VictorGijsbers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers">VictorGijsbers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424119/#Comment_424119" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T03:43:33+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  3:43AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If this is on topic, could someone explain the difference between the major OSR games?

I'll start by providing a scheme of categorization:<br/><br/>First, the textual history of D&amp;D in a nutshell:<br/>- The original -74 D&amp;D is a garage game, indie through and through; I at least get nostalgic for the indieness of it by looking at it, and it already has all the most important parts of the game. There are plenty of people for whom it is a favourite edition for the simplicity, lack of consumerism, and purity of vision.<br/>- AD&amp;D is a complex and official thing, it's for those who are really into the Gygaxian fantasy world in all its complexity. Mechanically it simply has more, and most of what it has is crazy bullshit, except if you're into it, in which case you apparently like it. Others mostly mine it for ideas. The 2nd edition is largely irrelevant for the OSR, because most do not find much of utility in it; they either go for 1st edition AD&amp;D, or the basic lineage. Still, it's essentially the same game, so you can use that instead of the 1st edition if you feel like it. It is cleaner and less mechanically insane, at the price of being less flavourful and having more new school ideology in it.<br/>- Basic D&amp;D, meaning the textual lineage that progressed alongside AD&amp;D through the '80s, is in general more streamlined than AD&amp;D, and consequently more elegant. It apparently used to be considered the "children's game" at the time, but currently it is not at all uncommon for people to find it the most playable and useful lineage. I know I do, the Mentzer edition is the best TSR D&amp;D with the possible exception of the -74 original.<br/>- Most people see a sea-change in the game when it comes to the 3rd edition, and I do think that this is justified. Probably the biggest change is the focus on formalistic character-builds: for the first time you could build a character from 1st to 20th level from the armchair, which changed a lot in how things like game balance and lethality was understood. While many OSR gamers seem to loan mechanical ideas from the 3rd edition, few specifically use the entire system for their play.<br/>- Everything after the 3rd edition is essentially irrelevant, it's just too different a game at that point.<br/><br/>The next step from those games are the retro-clones, which are games that basically attempt to clone the original game under a different name for spurious legal reasons. Labyrinth Lord (Basic), OSRIC (AD&amp;D) and Swords &amp; Wizardry (-74) are the most important ones, but there are plenty of others focusing on e.g. Rules Cyclopedia (a sort of second edition for Mentzer from the early '90s), 2nd edition AD&amp;D and so on. Playing these is like playing the corresponding TSR game, except usually they're better organized, and depending on the editor's tastes they tend to fix/streamline the most insane bits of the old rules. Usually a better choice than the TSR original, and easier to find, too.<br/><br/>If you grok the differences between AD&amp;D, Basic and 3rd edition, I think that's the most important difference in all of the above, really.<br/><br/>Comparing to the above, games like LotFP (really, it's the most prominent in this category) are still largely retro-clones in that the rules systems are very closely aligned with the original textual tradition. In LotFP's case it's mostly Mentzer D&amp;D, although simplified and streamlined. What differs in LotFP in comparison to the retro-clones proper is that it does not attempt to duplicate the literary elements: instead of Gygaxian fantasy the game presumes a sort of historical horror fantasy setting. This doesn't affect the mechanics of the game for the most part (you could play in e.g. Mystara with LotFP easily enough), but things like equipment lists, monster and magic design philosophy and such campaign-specific things are affected.<br/><br/>Once we've gotten through everything above, what we have left are games that do different degrees of mechanical innovation in comparison to the historical TSR models (which in themselves have a wide mechanical scope, of course, being as how we're talking of a dozen different rules texts for doing basically the same thing). I would divide these into two boxes: in one box are the games that specifically retain the mechanical cornerstones of D&amp;D (xp, levels, hitpoints, flat d20 random distributions, saving throws, etc.) while not hesitating to remix everything for new purposes, and in the other box are games that are "going for that old school feel" without necessarily retaining any D&amp;D mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424123/#Comment_424123" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T05:20:34+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  5:20AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>A good example of the first box where you're still going with the mechanical basis of D&amp;D is <i>Broadswords &amp; Bucklers</i>, an enchanting little game about being a rogue-ish fellow in renaissance London. It has new character classes, new xp mechanics, new injury rules, a new campaign model circling around the tavern/HQ the adventurers choose for themselves... but it is still essentially D&amp;D in that the agenda, principles, structures and procedures of play are the same. It's just very extensive house-ruling on the mechanical incidentals, one might say. My own house game sits in this same box: massive mechanical revision, yet made with constant reference to the wisdom of the ancients.<br/><br/>A good example of the second box is <i>Barbarians of Lemuria</i>: it's still pretty old school in goals and structure and procedures, but as it abandons the mechanical cornerstones of D&amp;D, it's clearly a much more distant cousin to everything above. The OSR scene in general is really pretty divided on whether "OSR" means D&amp;D or this wider expansion of franchise. <i>Traveller</i> is an excellent example of the question - is Traveller relevant to your interests if you're interested in the OSR? For some it obviously is (it has many of the same fundamental assumptions about how a rpg is structured), while for others it's not because it's not D&amp;D (no xp, levels, etc.) and therefore not directly relevant to their own play.<br/><br/>If we wanted to expand from the above even further, the next "step out" would be games like Dungeon World, I guess: nothing in particular to do with old school D&amp;D methodologically or procedurally, yet the literary topic is similar, and some people see a relevance.<br/><br/>The above scheme is relevant for your question because the salient properties of the various OSR games are almost always of two types: what flavour of D&amp;D does it emulate, and what literary trappings does it rely on? The reason for the existence of the vast majority of the various OSR games you'll find out there is that there wasn't yet a retroclone for that specific flavour of TSR D&amp;D, or that the author wanted to hack an old school rules set for some specific genre or milieu (e.g. space opera, Gamma World, various historical milieus, pulp fantasy). The literary trappings thing is pretty obvious to recognize, I think, so learning to recognize the different mechanical flavours of D&amp;D (original, AD&amp;D, Basic, 3rd and proge are basically the main ones, as can be seen in the above treatment) seems like the best bet if you want to learn to distinguish between the different OSR rules sets.<br/><br/>All that being said, though, I would like to suggest that the differences are not necessarily very important. Many people mix and match material freely between a wide majority of these systemic options, and thus their home games can't be said to properly represent any of them by the book. This is, of course, completely fine for the OSR gamer who subscribes to the pre-eminence of rulings over rules. Besides, many of the mechanical flavours that people obsess over are <i>really</i> minor; I wouldn't expect anybody to care about the differences between Holmes and Mentzer myself, for example, but here we are with plenty of retroclones for both varieties of Basic D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Even further, if the mechanical differences above do not mean anything to you, then it's likely that the different flavours of OSR rules sets don't necessarily carry any meaning for you. The differences only matter to people for whom the mechanical details of e.g. saving throws or healing HP matter somehow, and that's not likely to be anybody who's coming to the subject matter cold. For this reason I suggest not worrying about the different rules sets too much; if you want to play, just pick up any carefully edited rules set that roughly matches the literary flavour you're looking for from your campaign, and go play. You'll have plenty of opportunity to fine-tune once you know what you want. Just stay away from the AD&amp;D-based systems if you want to avoid needless complexity <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424124/#Comment_424124" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T06:03:44+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  6:03AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great summary, Eero.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424129/#Comment_424129" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T07:28:57+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  7:28AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When applied properly, the Internet Hive Mind is kind of something amazing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424131/#Comment_424131" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T07:41:32+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  7:41AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was amazing, Eero.<br/><br/>I want to make one small point adding to Eero's many: Lamentations of the Flame Princess does have a few mechanical innovations not found in basic D&amp;D.

No big list of monsters. For some people, this is a bug ("How can it be D&amp;D without a list of monsters!!!"). But the game assumes that monsters should be unique and specific and crafted by the GM one by one. I don't think one can understate how this change (big? small?) affects so much of what GM prep is like, and how it should affect color/fiction of play as the GM thinks about the adventures and how he delivers the adventures for the Players to experience.<br/><br/>I bring this up to expand on another of Eero's points: That all of this variety is about people building their own systems to reflect tone/setting/experience that they want to delver at the table. <i>Carcosa</i>, not mentioned above, is it's own thing completely. Yet, no matter what you think of it as a specific piece of work, it is an extension of the design philosophy found in the text of OD&amp;D. Or, rather, it is in execution of it. The author simply took the instruction from Arenson and Gygax all the way.<br/><br/>I'm not convinced anyone should be being <i>Carcosa</i> as a text to actually use in their own play, but as an example of how one can take the basic mechanics and reshape them to one's own creative impulses. There's no shame in this. Painters study the brushwork of other painters, and so on. I know James Raggi wrote the text for <i>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</i> to be quite compatible with previously published D&amp;D materials. But his own game, for the last two years, has featured no demi-humans, no NPC Clerics, and there are no Gods of for the PC Clerics to tap (they are deceiving themselves in a kind of dark metaphysical shell game from what I can tell of his posts). His campaign is currently set in an alternate 17th Century Europe with a Weird Fantasy/Lovecraft/Ashton Clark Smith flair. Firearms were added in the re-write of the game to make this possible. And yet... as Eero said above, anyone sitting down to make up a character or roll to hit or making a saving throw would know exactly how to handle the basic elements if they'd played early versions of "D&amp;D." It's just that it doesn't have the Gygax-World feel that, let's say, <i>Dungeon World</i> is so careful to recreate. Someone walking into his game would get the mechanics, but if they were expecting to use a Cleric to battle a room full of gnolls to bring back some back items to sell for gold... then, they'd be lost for a session or so figuring out what the heck was going oin.<br/><br/>is <i>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</i> OSR, then? D&amp;D retro? The answer is "Well, yes..." But I'd add, "Because it's as different as Gygax and Arneson expected the games to be back when they hacked together OD&amp;D."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424157/#Comment_424157" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T12:13:52+00:00" title="November 13, 2013 12:13PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is <a href="http://greysix.weebly.com/dd-retroclones.html" rel="nofollow">a list of various OSR games and retroclones</a>, each with a short description, if you want to dive in further.

It's all too easy to end up with a crippled (or over-powered) character, and <b>having no input into your character's basic type inhibits roleplaying</b>.</blockquote>\nThis is a disparity of expectation on your part, not a fault of the system or its intentions. Old-School  gaming is foremost about challenging the players tacticly and strategicly, not role-playing in the modern sense of "build a story about your character on a literary model." Randomly rolling up a character is exactly like being dealt a hand of cards in poker, the point is to meet the challenge by making the best of what you get. The fragility of starting characters is also part of the challenge (and starting characters are always fragile no matter how lucky their rolls, even a straight 18's Fighting-Man has a significant chance of being killed in two blows or one missed saving throw). "Role-playing" is something that can happen within this context, but the system neither discourages nor encourages it to exist. Interestingly, for some people that makes the role-playing richer.\n<blockquote>Lookup tables. One of the worst holdovers from the game's wargaming roots. Having to page through the book to find a table, then trace through it to find the right cell, is a real drag and slows down the game.</blockquote>\nActually, I'm hard-pressed to think of any truly Old-School games that require that sort of table look-up. Yes, there are tables in OD&amp;D, but they're mainly about organizing data, they don't have to be referenced much in actual play. Constant table-checking is more an artifact of second generation systems like <i>Rolemaster</i> and <i>DragonQuest</i>, which saw deliberate complexity as a virtue.\n<blockquote><br/>I'm not sure what these games provide \u2014 other than nostalgia and the pleasure of deliberately mastering something clunky \u2014 that you can't get in better form from modern dungeon-themed rulesets like Dungeon World, Old School Hack or Dungeonslayers. (DS in particular seems very much like what OD&amp;D would be like if it were reinvented today.)</blockquote>\nIf your goal is narrative-building with a dungeon theme, then yes DW and its like is a better choice.

Haven't had a chance to play it, but they're an interesting read. Its still a challenge-focused game, but the emphasis is on arena-combat over strategic exploration. This especially shows through in the magics system, where spellcasters are carefully delineatd to match-up against non spell-users and spells are carefully delineated to one clear tactical effect. The system also amusingly is an early case of rules-as-physics, explicitly so. Highly advanced charcters who want to learn new skills are encouraged to seek out dragons. Not as mentors, but because dragons' special power is to erase skills from a target's memory, coincidentally freeing up slots for new skills.  <br/><br/>Whereas OD&amp;D is run as "show up, someone rolls a character, someone runs a dungeon," I think TFT followed a different model of "show up, everyone makes a character, then has them fight."   <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424203/#Comment_424203" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-14T11:36:40+00:00" title="November 14, 2013 11:36AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2013 11:40AM by E.T.Smith.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>To dig deeper, the thought that <i>Dungeon World</i> has anything to do with playing an OSR-styled game is.... well, weird.

Among other things: I played the fighter, got into a fight, and when that fight went against me surrendered. Afterward one of the referees asked me why I cut the scene short before it climaxed.

My players bring books from other versions with spells that they want to learn and we pick the coolest-seeming, most complicated variant. Sometimes different characters cast different editions of the same. But best of all, they know some parts of my agenda as referee and know that sometimes I play monsters "by the book" and sometimes I make things up and sometimes I go back to pre-d&amp;d or early-d&amp;d sources, fairy tales, etc. So when they are planning and hearing about terrible things (ie. every week), they end up in a delightful discussion about what it all means. Some of them have played different versions of D&amp;D, OSR or otherwise, some have played videogames, some know literature, some are just along for the ride\u2014but what they really want to know is whether they are going to need magic, silver, or cold iron, or whether the Hydra is going to regrow its heads or whether the dragon is going to spit acid that they could take cover from or douse them with poison gas, if it even is a dragon at all.<br/><br/>The fact that they all have different expectations from the different parts of culture makes that conversation feel really alive, and they really invest themselves in all of the kinds of logic that this exposes\u2014the mechanical bits of the OSR, figuring out believable folk-tale explanations for things because they know that's how I roll, and mixing them up: realizing that the trolls are <i>simultaneously</i> D&amp;D regenerating trolls and storybook turn-to-stone-in-the-sun trolls and that one of them can drag them outside while the others keep them below zero hit points.<br/><br/>Last week ended with one player cursing another (in the best way) for introducing the very idea of gnomes at the table, because they weren't a part of "my" D&amp;D until someone brought them there, and now good folk had perished.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424233/#Comment_424233" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-15T05:37:26+00:00" title="November 15, 2013  5:37AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is some bullshit DW GMing right there, E.T.

(1 sp = 1 XP). You get a little bit of treasure for killing monsters... but the real meal is from pulling treasure out of places of mystery and danger.<br/><br/>There's no XP for roleplaying, showing up, completing a plot line, performing as your class, or anything like that. It's for putting your nose toward treasure and following it till you find the treasure and bring it back.<br/><br/>I ask because everything you write in that post makes perfect sense to me. I love all the fictional stuff and adding context for the stuff outside the adventure. If anything else, it provides a baseline of fictional "normalcy" that sets both the adventurers and the adventure environments apart from famers and villagers which makes them special.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in the LotFP system, there's less finagling required -- since the Players are by definition going to be predisposed to head off toward some place where treasure is waiting. (Very much in the tradition of <i>The Hobbit</i>, essentially!)  What the fiction turns out to be is what happens when <i>these</i> adventurers deal with <i>these</i> dangers on the way to find and recover <i>this</i> treasure. The Players have less need to pay attention to context of the dangers since the point is to get through whatever dangers to that treasure. <br/><br/>This has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not there are many options of places with treasures to go explore. They can of course go choose one or the other, each with bits of color or whatever that might be more enticing. And add on top of this: if the GM wants, he can begin stitches bits of fiction between the dangerous environments if the Players seem intrigued with it. An idol to an old god they find in one dungeon that they really dig might lead the GM to add a whole new temple somewhere else that reveals more about the god.<br/><br/>But, ultimately, either way, in LotFP they're heading into the dungeons no matter what, no matter the color, for that treasure. And that simplifies a lot of things, I think.<br/><br/>Once XP awards start coming from broader/more narrative sources, the Players now are more invested in choosing which kind of story/fiction they want to become invested in.<br/><br/>So, I'm curious, how is XP working in the kind of play you're describing.?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424281/#Comment_424281" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T11:07:00+00:00" title="November 16, 2013 11:07AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2013 11:11AM by Marshall Burns.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With D&amp;D, I do XP for treasure, with a bonus for "defeating" (not necessarily killing) monsters guarding treasure equal to 10% of their hoard, with the total modified for relative monster difficulty (ratio of monster HD to character level).

You know how the GM is supposed to communicate the town's problem through his portrayal of the NPCs and whatnot? It's kinda like that.<br/><br/>Like, for the KFS example:<br/>Before the PCs even get into the KFS, they'll have to pass through border checkpoints manned by UTA mercs (which the PCs would recognize as such), and they'll probably encounter a UTA caravan with something crazy on a flatbed trailer like an entire fighter plane. Also, blizzards or the evidence of blizzards (which is a really weird thing in this part of the US). Maybe when they get into a town they see a small anti-Elders protest rally.<br/><br/>If any of this stuff is at all interesting to the players, they will grab an NPC and be all, "hey, wtf is going on here?" If the NPC doesn't know, he points them to one that does know. If an NPC has no reason to hide anything, then he spills what he knows. If the NPC does have a reason to hide something, then he equivocates or clams up, and the GM gives the players that look like, "oh yeah, he's hiding something" and you go into social conflict resolution (for which I have a pretty good non-rolling, non-numerical system that I can talk about if you want).<br/><br/>As the GM presents all the information, it's not in his interests to hide anything unless doing so opens up an interesting challenge for the players to opt in to. After all, the GM's main job here is to present an interesting game board. So that means any investigation never gets all trail-of-breadcrumbs, you-must-find-this-clue-to-proceed like so many implementations of CoC. If there's such a clue, just drop it on the players' heads. And if this kind of poking around isn't what your players are into, it might be better to just tell them the whole situation in a meta-fashion.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424285/#Comment_424285" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T13:22:10+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  1:22PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> social conflict resolution (for which I have a pretty good non-rolling, non-numerical system that I can talk about if you want).</blockquote>\nPlease, do. ^_^<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424304/#Comment_424304" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T18:16:30+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  6:16PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            XP in the Flame Princess is the same as in Basic D&amp;D (and OD&amp;D), except James moved to a silver pieces standard, I think for real-world historical reasons.

AD&amp;D introduced all these "how do we make a real world that is real" thing. (Which mucked up play, I think.)<br/><br/>This is one of my revelations about Classic Traveller through this thread: the game probably works best as a series of tactical/problem solving encounters mediated through thick dollops of fiction. <br/><br/>GDW then introduces what is supposed to be a persistent universe. The same kinds of persistent worlds that would be the norm in, say, World of Darkness years later. I suspect that The Third Imperium as a kind  of simulation and the Clasic Traveler rules didn't always mesh that well. Not that they couldn't -- but the gears between the PCs and what they could do and the detailed setting were not always that clear.<br/><br/>See Eero's comments in the OSR/Experince thread nearby for more on how tight focus on activity keeps the players from feeling ambiguous on what the heck they're supposed to be doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424330/#Comment_424330" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-17T15:24:07+00:00" title="November 17, 2013  3:24PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a><br/>The first part is a hard rule that your goal in any social conflict is to get the other guy to perform some action -- telling you something, going somewhere, sending his armies to the upcoming war, etc. You can't ever count on making someone change the way they view things or think or feel; that might happen, but it's not your goal.<br/><br/>So, it's a problem: how do I make this person do what I need them to do? So then you solve the problem. And it's a lot like disarming traps without a roll: you poke around at it, examine it until you figure out where you can wedge a stick to block the head-choppy mechanism.<br/><br/>So you have to find about the person enough to learn where you can apply pressure to get them to acquiesce. Will he respond to threats (and what kind?), or appeals to reason, or appeals to his better nature, or what? What does he value, what does he desire, what are his vulnerabilities, and how can you leverage those? The DM should probably always have at least one solution in mind, but should be open (and perhaps even charitable) toward the attempts of the players. The DM judges the success of these attempts based on his vision of the NPC, trying to be accurate and honest (and perhaps charitable). Then he communicates how effective the attempt was through his depiction of the NPC.<br/><br/>And I said non-rolling, but I do use the reaction roll to determine the starting disposition of just about everyone and everything the PCs encounter. But that just determines attitude, not action (well, unless you get the attacks-right-away result).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_424337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424337/#Comment_424337" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-17T19:31:17+00:00" title="November 17, 2013  7:31PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2013 7:31PM by contracycle.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>That definitely seems to suggest that as the GM, you shouldn't listen to the players, but should instead force them to do as you say. </blockquote>\nAnd again, you say that like it's a bad thing.

For OSR fans, the point is that the details of rules wording isn't important. If PCs decide to engage in raids and looting of "civilized" lands - the GM either decides that is fine and works with it, or if he has a problem with it, he will fix it using his judgment. \n<blockquote>This conception of the GM as the all-powerful guy who gets to make all the decisions and can ignore the rules as much as he likes -- does that reflect the OSR movement as a whole? This is not a rhetorical question. I've read only this one document, and I'm curious.<br/><br/>(If so, how can you possibly make such a game work? It sounds like a recipe for unmitigated disaster. This principle seems, for instance, to be utterly incompatible with a second principle touted by the "Quick Primer for Old School Gaming": namely that the game is about player skill, not character skill. If the GM gets to decide everything, the only player skill that is left is "influencing the GM to make decisions favourable to you".)</blockquote>\nI'd encourage trying to join in a well-recommended OSR game to try it out. I played in a game of Lamentations of the Flame Princess run by author James Raggi (with Jason Morningstar), and I thought it was a lot of fun. <br/><br/>It's true that player skill is filtered through GM judgment, but that covers a lot of ground. One could say that the only important skill for Olympic athletes is influencing the judges to make decisions favorable to them. However, they exert that influence by demonstrating a variety of different skills, and it is those skills that impress the judges. Now, obviously, GMs are not world-class judges - but players aren't world-class athletes, either. <br/><br/>Such judged assessments are not objective tests of skill in the way that a chess game is. However, this means that they can assess a much wider set of skills. The players can try a solution that is "outside the box", and it has a chance of working. Sometimes the GM will make bad calls, but that is the trade-off.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424377/#Comment_424377" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T12:12:13+00:00" title="November 18, 2013 12:12PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now, obviously, GMs are not world-class judges - but players aren't world-class athletes, either.</blockquote>\nSpeak for yourself, but I can assure you that our D&amp;D circle is definitely world-class, referees and players included.

To break that down more explicitly for you:  I am saying that <i>tests of skill</i> that happen in an OSR game are far less competitive and stringent than Olympic athletics. GMs do not expect players to have any particular training regimen, and players are willing to accept foibles on the part of GMs in judging the success of their action. <br/><br/>In other words, RPGs are not a massive, competitive sport like Olympic events. The RPG blogosphere likewise is not a peer-reviewed publication where you need to pass stringent qualifications to be heard. \n<blockquote>John, what did James do to make it a lot of fun?</blockquote>\nI wrote <a href="http://darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/cons/solmukohta2012.html#Lamentations of the Flame Princess" rel="nofollow"><b>more details on the game</b></a> in my con report for Solmukohta 2012. <br/><br/>I don't think there was any particular "secret sauce" or "auteur mastery" in how James ran things. It was a fun scenario dealing with dopplegangers on the loose by a crossroads inn. We played through it and had fun. It was more chaotic and weird, rather than trying to be a clever puzzle to solve. The dopplegangers were potentially deadly, so there were consequences of failure to deal with them - but there was not a particular solution that we were supposed to find. If you had particular questions about the scenario based on my write-up linked above, I'd be happy to answer them. <br/><br/>Eero - this was the game we played just before the Fables of Camelot game that you ran last year at Solmukohta.

I have a big love-hate relationship to it myself: on the one hand the monster is excellent and the set-up is near perfect for a one-shot convention environment or similar, but on the other hand it sucks as an intro to a campaign or as something for a beginning referee to run (it's written to encourage techniques of GMing that I personally consider undesirable for D&amp;D), which were the purported goals of the scenario.<br/><br/>Regarding athleticism of D&amp;D, I suspect that we disagree somewhat due to my taking the game more seriously than you do (as if we didn't have a training regimen), and you taking sports culture more seriously than I do; however, as it doesn't pertain to the topic, and I was mostly joking anyway, we can save that discussion for another time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424394/#Comment_424394" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T15:17:11+00:00" title="November 18, 2013  3:17PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, thanks for the link!

This is of course old chicken-noodles for Forge-heads to get annoyed about, but the thing is that I find this a very problematic structure for an old school D&amp;D adventure as well. As you know, traditionally those adventures tend to be location-based, and while that's not the be-all-end-all of possibilities, it has the big advantage of not being a big, fat railroad.<br/><br/>Now, Jim tells me that his intent was to write an adventure where the prep will "obviously" go out the window after the very first scene, being as how the players will surely do something or other that is not in the plans. Make of that what you will; my own thinking is that if this was actually what happens, then traditional prepped-plot adventure design would never had become the dominant paradigm in the first place. I would assume that if the LotFP box ever got the sort of traction for which a game actually needs beginner materials, that adventure would just be another hypocritical traditional piece of text in a hobby full of them: we saw literally hundreds of roleplaying games through the '80s and '90s that did exactly this same thing, presenting a game that supposedly has these interactions and that idea in them, but when you got to the sample adventure, it was just another bunch of prewritten plot for the GM to finagle into play around whatever the rules-mechanics du jour happen to be.<br/><br/>(I am, obviously, putting the argument in pretty strong words for the sake of clarity. In reality <i>Stranger Storm</i> is pretty mild insofar as traditional plot-line adventures go, it's just such a disappointment to have one in the first place. Not that I can tell Jim what to do, I'm sure somebody finds it useful, etc. etc., of course. Ultimately it's no worse a sin than that Jim simply wrote the sort of adventure text he knows; he wasn't setting out to revolutionize the writing of adventure scenarios here, after all, so I'm sure he just took the structure that seemed the most obvious and ran with that.)<br/><br/>I would probably have written this same adventure myself by establishing the opening scene, introducing the monster, and then providing a bunch of environmental and tactical elements, most of them in random tables, expecting the referee to run the monster's tactics and strategy according to the monster description, and the milieu according to a random jumble of inspiring and vaguely connecting ideas. This would have maintained the purity of prep in that the referee would not need to sit down at the table with a precreated conception of what the next scene after this one will be like. Even if you're prepared to chuck it all after the players go off the rails, like Jim suggests you should do, I at least couldn't help being informed by the supposed plotline after I'd been introduced to the elements of the adventure by that means.<br/><br/>In summation for Christopher: the technique of GMing that I find objectionable is the preplotting of <i>if -&gt; then</i> logic trees of events as a means of preparing to run the game; nobody should learn to run D&amp;D like that, when it actually has the amazing distinction of being a game where it is not necessary for the GM to predict and control the direction of play, unlike perhaps the majority of all roleplaying games ever conceived.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424397/#Comment_424397" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T15:49:46+00:00" title="November 18, 2013  3:49PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, <br/><br/>Exactly.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424421/#Comment_424421" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T00:14:19+00:00" title="November 19, 2013 12:14AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero - I haven't read the text of the adventure in question.

(I'm opposed to linear plots in any games I play.) <br/><br/>But I don't think Eero was saying it was a railroad -- only that it was <i>time/event dependent </i>rather than location based. That said, I think James did a great job with laying out the structure. There was something about <i>Stranger Storm</i> that seemed a time dependent adventure while in many ways feeling location based. Reading <i>Better Than Any Man</i> I get a similar feeling. He's taffy-pulling the form a bit in an engaging way. (The text of Stranger Storm is quite clear that if they PCs leave the environment of the adventure that's fine -- and there's always another adventure over the hill. In no way is the GM supposed to keep the players in the adventure.)<br/><br/>After reading <i>Rules &amp; Magic</i> and the <i>Referee Book</i> and then reading <i>Stranger Storm</i> was this:<br/><br/>1. After reading the material so far I had been expecting a location based adventure given what the Rules and Referee text had said.<br/>2. The Treasure was sort of hidden -- both narratively and physically. The Players are presented with a mystery and expected to explore it <i>because it is a mystery</i>. The fact that treasure is involved only becomes clear after several scenes and the interaction with one specific NPC -- that the PCs might or might not ever talk to. Given the discussions of XP and Treasure in the Rules and Referee text, I had been expecting that to be more explicit. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, <i>Stranger Storm</i> is exactly the kind of adventure I would have made up for my friends back when I was playing AD&amp;D in high school!<br/><br/>I've started a new thread for <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19001/settings-and-adventures-for-osr#Item_1" rel="nofollow">thoughts on adventure and setting design over here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18975/talk-to-me-about-osr/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18975/talk-to-me-about-osr">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18975/talk-to-me-about-osr/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18975/talk-to-me-about-osr/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18975/talk-to-me-about-osr/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18975%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18975%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
