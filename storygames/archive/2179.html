                    George's Children is an original game design by Jon Hodgson and jim pinto.<br/>
<br/>
I've now playtested this game four times, and it's really taking shape. We had a great game on Friday, but I'm still having trouble with the economy of the tokens.<br/>
<br/>
In George's Children, the players take on the roles of children (ages 7 to 12) in an apocolyptic world devoid of adults. The true cause of the apocolypse isn't important, but the tone of the game is determined by the way the players narrate the game. Told in five acts, this GM-less game is run with no prep-time and very little paperwork. The events take place over the course of ONE DAY in the life of the characters... who do not need to know each other before play begins, but who find cause (during Act II) to journey together.<br/>
<br/>
To Play: You need only four colors of tokens and a method (perhaps pennies) of flipping coins. Tokens with two different sides are ideal.<br/>
<br/>
The Act structure is as follows.<br/>
<br/>
Act I: Breakfast<br/>
Act II: Rumors<br/>
Act III: Hero's Journey<br/>
Act IV: Finale<br/>
Act V: Bedtime<br/>
<br/>
In each act, the children must embellish different details of the game, narrating and advancing the story as little or as much as they can within the confines of the rules. Using their two stats (memory and imagination), the children can either Forge Bonds (reduce worry) with one another or Forge Confidence (gaining glory for themselves). When a child forges a bond with another character, he reduces the worry of both himself and the target player. When a child forges confidence, he sets a challenge for himself, that the other players can complicate by expending Memory or Imagination. If he succeeds, a point of Glory is gained (regardless of how complicated the act becomes).<br/>
<br/>
Worry is gained each time a child fails at anything and each time a child "refreshes" his token pool (memory and imagination).<br/>
<br/>
In Act I, the children must forage for food, each player narrating in Initiative order (youngest to oldest). In Act II, the children each tell a rumor (in reverse Initiative Order) of some THE that they have heard about. The THE is the thing that poses some sort of obstacle of the group and sets the plot for the story that session. There are two methods for determining which plot is most likely... spending Imagination... or voting... which is determined before play begins. Once the plot is determined, the children begin their quest while on their way to face the THE.<br/>
<br/>
Act III is where the children take turns (in Initative order) either Forging bonds or confidence, progressing the story as they go. Once a child gains five worry, he is out of the game (although the player may still be involved in Act IV). When a child reaches five glory, Act IV is entered and the child who gained the last glory begins telling the tale of the finale.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: In the Lord of the Flies version, play continues until all but one child has five worry. In the Extended game, play continues until everyone has either five (or more) glory or five worry.<br/>
<br/>
In Act IV (during the finale), each player (in turn) details one fact about the conclusion for each point of Glory gained. They do not spend it all at once, but rather detail one each, before play passes to the left. The player who gained five glory (in the standard version) gets to tell the first and final details of the finale. While it is inappropriate to maim or kill a player's CHARACTER during the finale, players that know one another well enough can embellish as much as they like. A fact (in Act IV) cannot advance the story to the point of no-return, but once a fact has been uttered, it cannot be undone by a successive player's embellishment, either. The facts should have something to do with the THE and should further the aims of the story. Beyond this, there are no hard and fast rules for how glory is used. Because there is no chance of failure, however, Glory is immensely more powerful than Memory or Imagination.<br/>
<br/>
In Act V, each player is allowed to detail one aspect of the character to his left (in Initiative order) for each point of Worry accrued during play. Each player takes a turn detailing ALL of the aspects of the character to his left... as they would affect the child THAT EVENING.<br/>
<br/>
During my most recent playtest, the story we told was incredibily entertaining, extremely dark, and (I hope) well-received. The hard-line difference between Imagination and Memory has finally been established thanks to this playtest. Because Aaron and I know each other, I was able to kill his character during Act IV and Vasco's detailing of my character during Act V was brilliant. Aaron's explanation of Josh's character's fate was equally brilliant.<br/>
<br/>
I think I only need to play this a couple more times before I'm ready to publish everything.<br/>
<br/>
Playtest: Josh, Vasco, Aaron, jim                </div>

                            Sounds like an interesting game - I remember reading about it over at the Forge. Do Worry and Glory have a mechanical effect? And any chance you could post a bit more about the last playtest?                        </div>

                            There's no board... and in fact, you could even play without a character sheet if you have a decent memory.<br>
<br>
Even if you do, the character sheet easily fit on an index card ... or post-it note.<br/>
<br/>
Worry and Glory have no game effect other than their use in Act IV and Act V.<br/>
<br/>
As for our last playtest, the game was very dark... it opened with the first two children unable to find food... and I added an angle to my character that I hadn't added before. Vasco and Josh really pushed the boundaries of what the game can do and for the first time I had a session that I felt emulated what the setting was supposed to be about.<br/>
<br/>
The plot was the search for "the Mommy." The youngest character (played by Josh) -- uninterested in ever growing up -- insisted that the Mommy would take care of us. Wayne Shermann presented a similar plot in the first playtest of the game with THE Grandma, but in this session we actually set out to find the fabled "adult." Without boring everyone with the details of the story, I will say that at Key moments players were producing opposition to one another's challenges, but it was Vasco who continually succeeded at everything he attempted and made it to five GLORY before anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
The final encounter in the Junkyard with a gang of other kids was amazing and if anyone had shown up with big egos, this game wouldn't have played out as well as it did.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the kind words, guys. I'll let everyone know when the game is available.                        </br></br></div>

                            Yeah, our story turned out pretty dark, but I definitely enjoyed it all the more.<br/><br/>Although there were moments during the "Hero's Journey" phase where I felt I was groping for things I wanted my character to accomplish (conficts), I think the whole experience really shone during the "Finale and "Bedtime" phases. In those segments the players were allowed free, interupted narration rights by spending the glory we'd accumulated so far. <br/><br/>By that point we were really going back and forth, riffing off the story elements and characterizations that we'd been bulding up over the course of the session.<br/><br/>I definitely think the ending rocked.                        </div>

                            Thanks, Vasco. Yeah. I think this was the best session to date. I'm eager to play again with the Imagination and Memory themes we came up with last time and then play it at the local con.<br/>

                            Update:<br/>
<br/>
Played my first non-playtest version of GC this weekend at OrcCon and I learned one vital piece of information... goofy players are going to play goofy children.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though. I do have to rearrange the initiative. Oldest goes first during ACT I (breakfast) and youngest goes first in ACT III (the journey).<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, short of finishing the editing and graphic design, this game is 99% done.                        </div>

And did this add or detract from the game? How did the change of tone and feel impact the play? Or didn't it?                        </div>
