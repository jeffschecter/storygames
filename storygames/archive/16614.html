The dress didn't quite survive the dry cleaning process to get all that awful slime out.  At least it didn't cost you anything, right?<br/><br/>Choose one:<br/><br/>You have been carving out your own life in the shadows and crypts of the graveyard.  Roll + Dark.  On a 10+, everything's fine, on a 7-9 pick one of the following, on a miss, pick three.<br/>*Something else has moved into your crypt and kicked you out.  What is it?<br/>*You have crossed paths with another supernatural entity and lost.  Who is it?  They gain a string on you.<br/>*There's been another murder; Randall Flower's handiwork, no doubt.  If only you could have been there to stop it.<br/>*You've been trying to restrain your hunger, but now you're about to snap.  Become your Darkest Self right now.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>You've decided you can't hide forever, and you realized you had to go through Principal Dremmer.  Roll + Hot.<br/>On a 10+, you've been reinstated in school and criminal charges have been dropped, after many hours of boring community service.<br/>On a 7-9, the same, but you've been strong-armed into some extra-curricular activities.  Name two of them.<br/>On a miss, the same, but one of the activities is particularly demeaning (school mascot, glee club, etc.)<br/><br/><br/>Cheers, your MC<br/>Dear Serpentine:<br/><br/>Have you resolved your darkest self?  How did you submit yourself to the old obligation of walking the line between human and serpent?<br/><br/>Also, choose one:<br/><br/>You have attempted to favor your human side this last month.  Roll + Hot.  On a 10+, all of them, on a 7-9, pick 2, on a miss, still pick 1.<br/>*You have gained the confidence of a human NPC.  Pick one and gain a string on them.<br/>*You have been spending a lot of time with another PC.  Gain a string on them, and tell them to gain a string on you.<br/>*You've spent time practicing human customs.  Carry 1 forward for your next roll that requires blending in with humanity.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>You've attempted to favor your family this last month.  Roll + Cold.  On a 10+, all of them, on a 7-9, pick 2, on a miss, still pick 1.<br/>*You've been encouraged to think of mortals as pawns.  Choose a human NPC; they gain the condition Snake Food.<br/>*You've been given a task by one of your family members (see your Failing Dynasty move).<br/>*You've learned some useful Serpentine tricks.  Carry 1 forward for your next roll when in your true form.<br/><br/>Cheers, your MC<br/>Dear Chosen,<br/><br/>Who have you been trying to please more: your mother, Charlene, or Coach Flowers?<br/><br/>If your mother, roll + Hot.  On a 7-9, gain a String on her.  On a 10+, gain 2 Strings on her.  On a miss, she gains a string on you.<br/><br/>If Charlene, you get the benefit of her knowledge of occult matters.  Activate the Chosen's To the Books move, rolling at +2.<br/><br/>If Coach Flowers, your effort is leading the team to a winning season!  Roll the \u201cwhen you play Football\u201d move.  If you pick the \u201cyou win\u201d option, the team is having an undefeated season.<br/><br/>Cheers, your MC<br/>Dear Ghost-<br/><br/>So, you've been living with Zola in the crypt for a month.  Ask her how the crypt's doing.<br/><br/>Being a ghost yourself, you're aware that there's other ghosts in the graveyard, but most of them aren't as active or corporeal as you.  Most of them are pretty lousy company too, but some can carry on an intelligent conversation.<br/><br/>So, who are you trying to open up to more, the living or the dead?<br/><br/>If the living, Roll + Hot.  On a hit, you've made a friend- one of the mortals in your class.  Pick someone or name a new NPC, and gain a string on them.  On a 10+, you get 2 strings on them.<br/>On a miss, your efforts fail, and you gain the 'total dork' condition.<br/><br/>If the dead, Roll + Dark.  On a hit, you've made a positive connection with another ghost.  Name them.  On a 10+, you gain a string on them.<br/>On a miss, you've drawn negative attention from other ghosts, and it hurt!  Take 1 harm.<br/><br/>Cheers, your MC<br/>Dear Vampire-<br/><br/>\u201cIt's simple,\u201d says Tina.  \u201cEvery vampire has to make a choice.  They can embrace their gift, revel in it, and rejoice as the blood flows through them.  Or they can shirk from it, cowardly, and hide amongst the mortals, still pretending to be one of them.  Maybe even fooling yourself.\u201d<br/><br/>If you follow Tina's advice and revel in your vampirism, mark xp, carry +1 forward for your next roll, heal 1 harm, and leave a trail of bodies in your wake.<br/><br/>If you don't, roll + Cold.  On a 10+, you're just super, on a 7-9, pick 1, on a miss, pick 2:<br/>*You're starving.  Carry -1 forward until you feed again.<br/>*You've offended Tina.  She gains a string on you.<br/>*You snap.  Become your darkest self.<br/><br/>Cheers, your MC<br/>Dear Infernal,<br/><br/>Who can resist the call of unlimited bonus minutes?  You, apparently.<br/><br/>The Dark Forces offer you a deal: you can trade in your Can't Save Myself Move for the Dark Recruiter move, and start earning double unlimited bonus minutes.  The choice is yours.<br/><br/>If you don't take them up on their offer, and instead break down and confess your backstory to another character this session, you gain an experience and they gain a string on you.<br/><br/>Cheers, your MC                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380115/#Comment_380115" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T15:38:18+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  3:38PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are for the game tonight.

In case things got boring, my plans were to have a big halloween beach party, and have a big three way battle between slime monsters, the scooby gang, and cultists.  Fortunately, it didn't quite go down like that.<br/><br/>At the start of the session, I got out a big sheet of posterboard and some colored pencils, and we drew the town and put in some landmarks.  Some things we didn't know before:<br/>Redbank is actually close to the ocean, but there's big craggy cliffs and no beach.  The 'beach' is on the large Lake Redbank.  It's called Redbank because there's heavy clay deposits.<br/>There's an abandoned ghost town from the 19th century on the other side of the lake.  There's also a massive Indian Burial Mound area.  (Misha: "There are no burial mounds in Maine."  Me: "There are now.")  There is the Electro-Cell battery factory, near the trailer park, suffering from recent layoffs, and pumping battery acid into the ocean.  There's a minor league baseball field (James: "Tourists eat that shit up.")  There's two beaches on the lake, a 'touristy' beach and a 'cool' beach.  There's a very well stocked library.  There's a combination faux-restored City Hall/County Courthouse/Police Station.  Reclusive author S.K. Duke has a mansion on the ocean cliffs.  There's a hospital, where the Chosen's single mom works.<br/><br/>The Ghoul choose to stay on the outskirts, and another of Coach Flower's murders showed up.<br/>The Ghost made a friend with another ghost- originally a kid from the ghost town, but since he never came up in session, he retconned it to a character that died during the session, which is awesome.<br/>The Chosen chose to lead the football team to an undefeated season.<br/>The Serpentine started stalking the Chosen. (Who thinks he's normal, so has a crush on him.)<br/>The Infernal avoided temptation, and later spilled his angst to the Vampire.<br/>The Vampire chose to resist the temptation, rolled snake eyes, and was starving and snapped, becoming his Darkest Self.  This was a major plot point for the session.<br/><br/>Starting out: There's a Halloween party on the beach and everyone should be there!  But Emily the Chosen has to take her little sister trick or treating.  She asks Marcell the Vampire to house sit and hand out candy.<br/>Winston Q. Black dresses as a cheesy vampire for Halloween week.  (Abram: "He's my favorite dark power.")<br/>The Infernal does boring investigative work (rolled as gazing into the abyss, which worked wonderfully), which takes several hours and leaves him drained, but he realizes that Coach Flowers, not Zola the Ghoul, is the serial killer.  After a confrontation at school with Coach Flowers, he breaks into Coach Flowers house.  But Coach Flowers had a string on him, and expected something like this to happen, so is waiting across the street, and calls the cops to report a break in.  Infernal runs away, into something worse... darkest self Marcel the vampire, who toys with him a bit.<br/>Chosen sees that Winston Q. Black has a blessed but cursed sword for sale that could be used to kill her nemesis, the Lord of Slime.<br/>The Serpentine's family tasks Seth with luring teens into the lake swimming so That Which Lies Beneath can eat them.<br/><br/>Halloween night:<br/>Emily the Chosen takes little sister Jess trick or treating.  Emily's dressed as a sexy french maid (turning on Marcel).  Marcel invites cheerleaders Mindy and Bethany over to Emily's house for implied three-way sexy time.  Seth, while walking to the beach, wearing the discarded halloween costume that Logan the infernal had when breaking into Coach Flower's place, gets spotted by Coach Flowers, who assuming it's Logan, kicks his ass, rips off his mask, and realise he's got the wrong guy.  "Trick or treat kid.  Welcome to America.  You need a ride somewhere?"<br/>(Serial Killer Coach Flowers, by the way, gains a string on anyone he deals harm to.)<br/>Marcel hypnotizes the girls, unhinges their sanity, ties them up, and starts tormenting them.  He gets out his phone and calls Coach Flowers, letting them beg him for help.  Around this time, Zola and Daniel the ghost are hanging out across the street from Emily's waiting for her to get back, wondering what Marcell sees in that Mindy bitch, and Marcel tells Logan that if he's looking for Coach Flowers, he'll be at Emily's.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Seth totally gets Bobby the football player into the lake, where he's consumed by That Which Lies Beneath.<br/><br/>Coach Flowers shows up, wearing a hockey mask and holding a machete.  Logan, Zola, Marcell, and Daniel are there.  Flowers bellows for everyone to leave.  Logan tasers Coach Flowers, rendering him unconscious.  They throw him into the basement, and realize that there are people down there.  Zola is mad at Logan and Marcel- she wants to kill Coach Flowers, but she wants to do it her way.  Lots of mutual shouting and shutting down.  Emily shows up home with little sister Jess, and tells her to wait outside while she goes in and finds out what's going on.  She shuts down Marcell and slams him into a wall, causing him to stop being his darkest self (put in his place by someone more badass).  Logan (I think) gets the girls out of there and takes them home.  While people are arguing, meanwhile Daniel is in the basement as Coach Flowers slowly regains consciousness.<br/><br/>Emily rolls hot to pass it off as a funny prank, which he seems to accept for the moment in his concussed state, Zola threatens him, and they decide to drive him to his place to sleep it off instead of taking him to the hospital.<br/><br/>One last thing: as Marcell is leaving, hungry, he sees Jess in her bunny suit at the foot of the driveway, looking worried.  He hugs her, says they're all worried, some crazed killer is on the lose.  And then he feeds on her.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380203/#Comment_380203" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-30T08:49:26+00:00" title="May 30, 2012  8:49AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is so messed up.

Are you also statting things up as Menaces, or are you running purely with the custom moves?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380442/#Comment_380442" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T09:44:02+00:00" title="June  1, 2012  9:44AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very interesting stuff.

So each session, or two sessions, is a single event spaced months apart.  I'm asking the players to pick the backdrop, next session will be "A Very Monsterhearts Christmas."  I can't wait for Winston Q. Black to start handing out presents.<br/>This obviously requires some bangs and aggressive scene framing to work, which the letters were part of. I also have menace writeups, and I'll go a bit into how I keep all the nods straight later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380974/#Comment_380974" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T08:29:37+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  8:29AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Session Four:  A Very Monsterhearts Christmas<br/><br/>Abram (Logan the Infernal) had the plague, so he wasn't able to make it.  He was written out of the session, his family vacationing in Florida.  I have evil plans to make his life not boring, but they're going to have to wait.<br/><br/>On the last day of class before winterbreak, a few things happen:<br/>*Marcell has gotten the condition "fucking psycho" for the cruel "Halloween prank" he played on Mindy.<br/>*Daniel sees deceased Bobby haunting the school.  Daniel's the only one who can see him... for now.<br/>*Zola finds out that the housing district she and Daniel are squatting in is going to be bulldozed to make way for the ElectroCell Nuclear Power Plant.<br/>*Zola also finds out that Winston Q. Black has xmas gifts for her and all her friends.<br/>*Seth's tutor Roxanne gives him the gift of local bestselling author S.K. Duke's novel "The Horror in the Lake."<br/>*Social worker Diane Richardson tells Daniel he has a state-assigned foster family.  He agrees to meet them later.  He finds out from Emily's mom that she's crazy religious.<br/>*Principal Dremmer tells Daniel that he reminds him of a student he had some ten years ago.<br/>Daniel: "What happened to that guy."<br/>Dremmer: "He got in over his head."<br/><br/>The gang meets up at the malt shop, including little sister Jess, who Emily promised to take xmas shopping.  Jess has crushes on all of Emily's male friends, but especially Seth, as it turns out.  Daniel, Marcell, and Zola can't resist cracking jokes about their undead-ness, which Emily tries to brush off as them joking around.<br/><br/>Emily: "Hello, little sister's here."<br/>Jess: "Oh, it's like Halloween, where Marcel was a vampire, Daniel was a ghost, and Zola was a hooker!"<br/>Zola: "WHAT?"<br/><br/>Later, while Emily is preoccupied.<br/><br/>Jess: "Guys, I'm twelve, you can be honest with me.  Is my sister a vampire?"<br/><br/>(Totally getting the wrong idea.)<br/><br/>Daniel meets with his foster-parents to be, and says that his "Satanic death metal lifestyle" might clash with theirs.  They walk out on him.  Mission accomplished?<br/><br/>Xmas Presents:<br/>Winston Q. Black gives:<br/>Zola a fancy dress, and a newspaper ("can I have that newspaper? " "of course!")<br/>Marcell a giant gothic coffin. ("Zola told me you were with the goth set.  I just need some help loading into my car so I can deliver it."  Mr. Black drives a hearse.  "Lots of room in the back for deliveries.")<br/>Emily the Cursed Sword.<br/>Jess an impossible geometry necklace.<br/>Seth a giant pet snake, and a ride home through the snow!  He meets the family, who find Mr. Black absolutely charming.<br/>Daniel a GPS device and a set of coordinates, which is enough to sate his curiosity.  ("Geocaching!  It's all the rage with the college set, I understand.")<br/><br/>Winston Q. Black now has a total of 10 strings across the 6 PCs, as well as a string on little sister Jess.<br/><br/>Emily invites Seth, Daniel, and Zola over for xmas dinner.  Emily's mom is mad at Marcell, so he's not invited.<br/><br/>Daniel and Zola have sexy time.  First time in game we've had sex moves trigger!  Zola now hungers for his ghost meat.  We find out why Zola has kept Coach Flowers alive thus far, and what Daniel remembers of his death (not all of it.)<br/><br/>Marcell goes over to Mindy's apologizes, and then vamps her.  I have him roll +Dark (with +1 forward).  He gets a 7-9.  She comes back, but slightly wrong.  Marcell is disappointed.  She wasn't supposed to come back like that.  I promise him a full custom move writeup.<br/><br/>Marcell:  "I will make it so no one can hurt you ever again."<br/>Mindy:  "Like self defense classes?"<br/>Marcell:  "You see, Mindy, I am a monster.  Like out of Anne Rice, or, or or (dammit don't say Stephanie Meyer)... Jim Butcher."<br/>Misha OOC: What's wrong with Bram Stoker?<br/>Sabe OOC" I don't think Marcell knows who that is.<br/>Mindy:  "Oh, you mean like Twilight?"<br/><br/>Chistmas Eve:<br/>Seth has a dream: a visitation from the Thing in the Lake.  He fails his Dark roll, so doesn't get any particular information, other than that it wants him to "Despoil their Christ's Mass."<br/>So what does he do?  Go xmas shopping.  Meanwhile, everyone else is going xmas shopping, and Marcell and Mindy are stalking the mall for victims, and Emily and Zola are meeting for coffee.<br/><br/>Daniel:  "It's my favorite sucker.... and Marcell."<br/>Mindy:  "I'll take you in the bathroom and suck you right now, Daniel."<br/>Daniel:  (roll to shutdown)  "You are such a whore."<br/><br/>After doing his shopping (giftwrap, and the book he's been reading for Jess), Seth releases his snake into the Santa Claus display chaos ensues.  Mindy grabs Bethany and goes back to her place with Marcell.  Seth retrieves his snake.<br/><br/>Mindy feeds on Bethany until she's dead.  Marcell tries to pull her off (lash out physically), but only succeeds in ripping a giant chunk out of Bethany's throat.  They end up tossing the body off of the oceanside bluffs.<br/><br/>Xmas Day:<br/><br/>Seth is disappointed that his despoiling of Christmas is overshadowed in the papers by a missing girl.  Oh well, he's got a Christmas dinner to attend.<br/><br/>Marcell abides his family's xmas dinner, but finally snaps- THEY KNOW!  He goes for a walk.<br/><br/>A perfectly nice xmas dinner at the Sorenson household.  With some pleading by Emily and Jess, mom agrees that Daniel can stay with them "until they can get a hold of some of his relatives."  Seth gives Emily the sanctified knife she lost that he found at the bottom of the lake.  Seth and Jess exchange S.K. Duke novels.  "I Was a Teenage Vampire Mass Murderer"  Marcell stops by, and leaves a note, which is lost in the bustle.<br/><br/>Daniel and Zola burn Daniel's old house down.  If it's getting torn down anyway, they might as well be the ones to do it.<br/><br/>Emily and Jess are cleaning up.  Jess decides to chug all the gravy.  Suddenly, she is possessed by the Lord of the Slime!  The heimlich doesn't work.  Emily calls Daniel and Zola to get there right away, and then gets mentor Christine on speaker phone.  "You have to do an exorcism.  Draw a pentagram in salt, and put on some Gregorian chants.  You have those on CD, right?"<br/><br/>Possessed Jess starts choking Mom, so Emily has to knock her out (doing great harm), but that makes her stationery enough to not resist the exorcism.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Zola hotwires a car and they drive towards the house.  Zola fails to Hold Steady, so a cop car starts following them with flashers on.  She fails to Run Away, and plows the car into a snow bank.  (Daniel then Runs Away, briefly bumping into Mindy, before getting to the house).  Zola encounters a police officer (the same one she bit earlier) who she attacks.  He puts a few shots into her (3 harm!) and then she eats him.  This is the first time she's killed to feed.<br/><br/>Daniel shows up at the Sorensen household.  They find the Gregorian chants CD.<br/>"Now lock hands and eminate positive energy."<br/>So they start singing "we wish you a Merry Chrismas."  Cut to shots of Marcell pacing and brooding and making a wooden stake, Seth asleep in the trailer park snuggled up with his snake and a book, and Zola murderously eating a police officer.<br/><br/>Final shot of Marcell's note on doorstep:  "Watch out for Mindy."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381024/#Comment_381024" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T12:01:10+00:00" title="June  6, 2012 12:01PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Willow</cite>Jess: "Oh, it's like Halloween, where Marcel was a vampire, Daniel was a ghost, and Zola was a hooker!"<br/>Zola: "WHAT?"</blockquote>\nWIN                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
