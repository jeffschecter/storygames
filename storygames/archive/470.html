                    Andy said, in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=444" rel="nofollow">Open Ability Lists and Awesomeness</a>:<blockquote>"The term we use is "No Set Abilities" or "No Set Skills"...  My group really has a problem where all the abilities are not set, and not offering suggestions, simply saying "Choose whatever you want! The possibilities are endless!" <br/><br/>And they are, it's just that it's really hard to decide what is appropriate, which stalls the game for us. "<br/></blockquote>This brought me back to the Story Deduction discussion, where we all raved about constraints and how they can help spur creativity when confronting a nebulous problem space.  Andy's group's problem begs for constraints.<br/><br/><b>Ways I've seen this addressed:</b>  Capes, of course, has Click-and-Locks, which tighten things up nicely--even if you don't want to just grab one from the book as-is, you can take "Firestarter" or whatever, scratch out "Nova Flame" and write in "Magma Eruption."  You've narrowed the problem space and made it your own. Zing!<br/><br/>Vincent has the "can he shoot?" discussion starter for Dogs, as suggested many, many times on the lumpley forum.  Breaking the Ice has the word-web, which isn't tightly bound to a list of abilities, but serves some of the same purposes.  And of course, the old-school constraint is "here's a list of fifty powers, pick five," which isn't really what we're going for.<br/><br/>Other examples are welcome too.  What I'm really interested in seeing here, though, is <b>new ideas on constraining an entirely open trait system</b>--not on balancing them against each other within the game, but on kick-starting your brain to generate interesting and useful descriptions of your character (/ship/gun/personal fairyland).  Hint:  flavor text don't cut it.                </div>

                            Brendan, flavor text is what you're asking for.<br/><br/>Stuff on a character sheet is player resources with a thin-to-thick layer of color that serves to characterize your guy.<br/><br/>This became very obvious to me while doing up the <a href="http://kallistipress.com/FLFS/downloads/FLFS%20Character%20Sheet%208.5x11.pdf/" rel="nofollow">list of skills for Full Light Full Steam</a>.  Who could do what when was a matter of dice.  Strictly speaking, you didn't need any names for the skills at all, and players could just say, "I'm rolling my fourth die pool now."  What the stat names provided was color, to contextualize and characterize the PCs and NPCs.<br/><br/>For an interesting alternative example, Bryan Hansel's Game Chef entry Pinnacle Empty Quiver is about commandos.  In order to get the skill list, he went to the US and UK commando webpages and just grabbed all the key words.  The skill list he came up with looks very functional, and is hugely evocative.                        </div>

                            I'm confused how the Capes example is not just flavor text, in your opinion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But while I and others sometimes have difficulty coming up with cool or interesting traits during character creation in games with open traits, I've never seen any problem coming up with cool traits from Fallout in the middle of Dogs in the Vineyard.  That's because the traits aren't expected to appear out of thin air (though you could, by the rules, make up traits unrelated to what's happening).  The traits are the result of that conflict, and its easy to come up with interesting ways the conflict affected your character.<br/>
<br/>
In the last game we played, my character gained "I don't need anyone's approval to do what is right 1d6", which is great but not the sort of thing I would ever come up with during chargen.                        </div>

                            I'm going to toss 'qualifiers' in again.  If you have a completely open skill/trait system, then the skills or traits that you choose should reflect three different 'level's of interest:<br/><br/>* How the character is different from the 'normal folks' of the setting.<br/>* How the character is different from the other characters.<br/>* The priorities of the player and the group in general.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that you should min-max within the group.  For instance, in <i>Dogs</i> every character has 'Guns' as a trait.  That's what differentiates them from the rest of the population.  Their relationship defines who the player conceives of them being, and there may be some differentiation between characters - he's the talker, he's the shooter.<br/><br/>Josh BR has the right of it (mostly) - you're really just covering over purely mechanical operations with colorful labels.  But since those colorful labels determine how the players perceive the objects on their character sheet, they're also very important, mechanically speaking.<br/><br/>This is a very incoherent post, so I'll write something else later.<br/><br/>The upshot: Open traits should be those things that make your character stand out - from the setting, from each other, and in the player's mind.                        </div>

                            I play the Rephrase Kuma game!<br/><br/>The colorful labels over mechanical details of player power can be flags describing player expectations of the game in three ways:<br/><br/>* How their character is significant<br/>* How their character is individual<br/>* The kind of game that the player wants to participate in<br/><br/>The last can also be used negatively, as in the HeroQuest character with high mental-domination-resistance because he didn't want to have to deal with that in game.                        </div>

                            The best way to constrain an open trait system, IMO, is by providing LOTS OF EXAMPLES. Maybe in the form of the character sheets of 3-5 sample characters, or in the form of a full page of nothing but examples that the game designer finds appropriate.<br/><br/>See, most indie games, because of a lack of playtesting with "real gamers" (someone outside their really supportive gaming group), missing a blind spot, and perhaps in some cases laziness (but I think it's mostly the blind spot thing), don't provide enough examples yet for things that are generally "open", whether the openness is traits, skills, settings, or themes.  Mant just say "work it out, you can choose anything!"<br/><br/>Personally, I can do this, but I love to see some guided examples. Not just a few, either, LOTS.  A huge span of them.  Seeing one I like, and twisting it a little to make it my own, is the best way I can make the most of openness.<br/><br/>I'm hoping that more people, when writing their games, offer lots of solid usable examples instead of just one or two.  This is, not entirely unrelated, my pet peeve with most technical documentation: Very few or no examples of using command-line commands to make commands that work in the real world...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I should have phrased that better--I realize that the name or description of a freeform trait is flavor text; I should have replaced "flavor" with "setting."  What I meant was this:
<blockquote><i>Jessa whipped her laser lariat high, whooping, and lassoed a violet sky-beast with one practiced throw.  "Gotcha, li'l bugger!" she crowed, and pulled out her clairvoyance stones.  "Now let's take a peek in your memory..."</i><br/><br/>Look at the <b>Belonging</b> slots on your character sheet.  Make up four things your character owns.  They can be anything!  Divide twenty points among them, with no more than seven points on any one.<br/></blockquote>So now I'm like, uh, I guess I can have a laser lariat.  Or clairvoyance stones.  Or...  psychic... cowboy boots?<br/><br/>Shreyas's example is exactly what I want to see.  He asks questions that make the player consider a limited imaginary space, and that drive the player into them via strong implications (I <i>am</i> known for something; my people <i>do</i> need me).<br/><br/>Similarly, Nick says he never has trouble naming traits gained from Fallout, because those names feel driven by something.  Imagine (not for Dogs, but for some other game) a table of a hundred Things That Could Scar You, along with a stat and a difficulty.  Roll three times and compare your own score in that stat to its difficulty.  Did you win or lose?  Why?  What did winning or losing do to you?  (I have a hazy idea that the Character Burner does something similar, but I don't own Burning Wheel yet.)  Or maybe a web of a hundred interconnected leading sentences:  "I can't drive because..." or "My brother died when..."  Pick one node and roll to move around the web, completing a sentence at every stop.<br/><br/>Both of those are just ways of hiding the Kuma / Joshua flags from the conscious mind, but I think they could be effective, especially when paired with the evocation Joshua and Andy mentioned.  The trick to writing things down is making yourself forget the paper.                        </div>

                            I think there are two processes at work here.<br/>
<br/>
- Ensuring the players are all 'on the same page' regarding what traits are appropriate for the setting. Good setting desription and lots of examples help here.<br/>
- Ensuring the traits are cool, original and help to drive the game. Questions work very well here, as do kickers, flags and other techniques designed to make the game meaningful to the player.                        </div>

                            Having run into the issue where descriptive terms are only as good as what the GM and player agree the description _means_ and _can accomplish_, I tend to ask "Is <i>keen</i> better than <i>clever</i>?  If you can fly, how high, how fast, how long?"  As a GM, I pin those things down quickly with questions like, "What do you WANT it to be able to do?"  As a player, I want to be able to do everything that would be reasonable for my character.  "I'm a hooligan.  I have a tricked out skateboard."  OK, unless I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">specifically</span> say otherwise, I want my GM to assume that I can ride that skateboard and that I can do some above-average tricks.  "I'm a secretary."  OK, I can alphabetize.  I can file.  I can take dictation, answer phones, arrange for travel for my boss, order meeting snacks...without having to pay for individual skills and being incompetent outside them; I've got the whole package, and I like that model.                        </div>

                            When we did the first edition of Fate, we included no skills list at all, as we were all about the openness and freedom of letting people skills on their own, convinced that it would be far more colorful and evocative.<br/>
<br/>
We were smoking something.  The absence of a skill list came up over and over again in people's responses.  it's not that they needed to be entirely handheld, but rather that they needed _something_ to uses as a basis for creating their own skill lists.<br/>
<br/>
Our solution for the second edition was to commit a whole chapter to how you might come up with a skill list.  it drew from functional category models, like 5 point Fudge, as well as from the utility model from BESM, and the final result was....OK.  It still skewed too fantasy, is a little too rigid, and honestly, it didn't open up enough of the guts of the system to the GM so I think it was a valiant effort, but ultimately a failure.<br/>
<br/>
Most tellingly, as we work on a setting-specific product, I would say that about 60-75% of our work has been in the playground around skills.<br/>

PS - on the other hand, Aspects being totally open ended and flexible works out just fine because the mechanical constraints on the play out pretty organically, though even that has some room for improvement                        </div>

<br/>
How would it work, that every time you had an opportunity to apply a trait, and you passed it up, that trait became a little stronger, but when you DO use them they get reset back to the beginning?  That way, you're not making narrower traits stronger because you THINK they would be less often used, but because they ARE less often used?<br/>
<br/>
This could be on a conflict-to-conflict or scene-to-scene basis, or even whole sessions.                        </div>

                            Rob, are you familiar with Nobilis's point-build gift system?  It includes a list of interesting gifts, plus five categories in which you can spend points (if it affects only you, cost -1; if it affects a small area, cost + 1...) to create your own.  I think this is the kind of thing Andy's talking about, where a list-based system still lets you tweak things to your satisfaction (the point build for each example is in the book).<br/>
<br/>
Fred, I like that idea, but how do you determine when such an opportunity happens?  Do you just go over your full list of traits during every round of a conflict and say "could use that, not gonna...  could use that, not gonna...?"                        </div>

                            You measure when an opportunity happens, as I said, by conflict, scene, or session.<br>
<br>
In other words, every time you have a conflict, a scene, or a session, all the traits that you didn't use get incremented by one.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hnh.  I admit, I was reading it as a broader sort of openness - the question is nicely applicable to something like Unknown armies too- but a focus to the OTE-esque field is cool too. :)<br/>
<br/>
So given that, the Nobilis model is well known to me and leaves me somewhat inclined to run and hide.  While it's not quite as abusable as it's predecessor, the Amber DRPGs item system, most of the real system-breakign stuff I've seen in Nobilis comes from the hard list-modifying approach.  If anything, it is _more_ broken because it allows players to turn play into a chinese horse race* by picking a narrower range of more potent element and using those to address the world.  Worse, the mechanic laid on top of an otherwise highly interpretive system adds legitimacy to the abuses.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I look at most open systems and they tend to be games where the GM has a lot of power of interpretation, including allowing lots of not-popular-in-certain-circles solutions like telling people they're being a dumbass, and that certainly can work.  It feels like that's what you want to avoid, but I realize as I look at it I'm not really sure, so here's my question to you, given the OTE example of Zen Master.  Do you want to:<br/>
<br/>
1) Keep players from taking something like Zen Master<br/>
2) Make the cost (whatever the currency) of Zen Master correlate to it's utility<br/>
3) Constrain the in-game application of Zen Master so it is no more potent than any other skill?<br/>
<br/>
Any one of these solves the problem, but they demonstrate such radically different priorities (and potential solutions) that I think it would be useful to consider a specific answer/<br/>

* If you have a fast horse, a faster horse and a fastest horse, and you are running 3 races against a guy with 3 equally fast horses, you could either run the races at equal speeds or you could guarantee victory by running your fast horse against his fastest, your faster against he fast and your fastest against his faster.                        </div>

<p>I think the trick here is define the traits in terms of fictional input into the SIS, rather than in terms of utility.  Capes and Polaris both do this.</p>
<p>In other words, every ability is always usable.  It's just that, when you use your ability, it's up to you the player to bring it into the play in some way.</p>
<p>This is a totally alien way of thinking about resources, I know.  But I think it's a much more productive one*.</p>

<p>P.S.  That said, I <em>do</em> use a more traditional view for some games I work on.  Depends on the game itself, of course.</p>

                            Rob and Ben, I can't argue with any of your points.  To be fair, this started as a thread about useful constraints that led to ideas for traits, as a way of avoiding blank-page syndrome; I think Nobilis is a good way to do that, abusable or no.  Coping with trait abuse is more the province of the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=444" rel="nofollow">Open Ability Lists and Awesomeness</a> thread.<br/><br/>That said, if we want to drift this thread into that conversation, I'm fine with it--I have what I wanted from this thread.                        </div>
