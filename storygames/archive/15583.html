Damn Simple Carpooling sets up scheduled SMS messages for your entire group so you can keep track of each person.<br/><br/>The app is very simple: just type in your phone number and your name, and then anyone involved in your car pool can join your group by sending a text message to the "group number" Damn Simple Carpooling spits out. You can set a time and place to meet, and they'll get reminders every day, asking them whether they'll be there. If they reply with "no", you'll get a notification. They can even message the entire group if they're going to be late.<br/><br/>Damn Simple Carpooling is a free service that works wherever SMS messages do.

Plus, we have a Google Group/List that we post to on the Day Of. <br/><br/>Other gaming organizations (I play in various other weird groups weekly or more) happens over email usually a few days to one day before. <br/><br/>Most of us are laid back, but not total slackers, so its never too messy or confusing.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353234/#Comment_353234" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-05T13:09:17+00:00" title="January  5, 2012  1:09PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you mean, like, "when are we going to play this week" scheduling, or "who wants to play Polaris weekly in January" scheduling?<br/><br/>I'm in the process of doing the latter, and it usually takes care of the former. I sent out an email a couple months in advance (to get people to tentatively plan for it) to 8 or so people; around double the needed amount for the game. I sent out another email in late December, and got just enough replies to set up the game. We discussed place, time, and days of the week that work. In my experience doing it this way makes the schedule pretty easy to stick to, as people have voiced their general weekly scheduling needs beforehand. And, of course, it's easier to stick to a weekly schedule for a month than for six months.<br/><br/>If people need to say "I can't play this week," usually it's just an email to the whole group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pjack" title="Pjack"><img alt="Pjack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pjack">Pjack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353265/#Comment_353265" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-05T21:36:57+00:00" title="January  5, 2012  9:36PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2012 9:41PM by Pjack.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like <a href="http://whenisgood.net/" rel="nofollow">When Is Good</a> for figuring out meeting times. Although honestly, I've had less than a 50% success rate with it. Either it turns out that there's no time when everyone can meet, or, more commonly, one or more people just refuses to use the scheduler.<br/><br/>In my experience, When Is Good is very handy for scheduling one-shot games and events. If you're interested in scheduling a regular game (weekly, bi-weekly, whatever), then you're better off just talking to everyone in the group. A regular game is more of a commitment than a one-shot, and there are more factors at play in people's lives than "I happen to be free that day".<br/><br/>Edited to Add: The campaign wiki <a href="http://www.epicwords.com/" rel="nofollow">Epic Words</a> has a built-in calendar and game reminder e-mails built in, which is a nice feature.

Then there's usually an e-mail sent around by the GM/whoever is hosting the game towards the end of the week as a reminder, and we also use e-mail to handle unexpected changes ("I'm getting dragged into work on Saturday, so can we do Sunday instead?") or potluck arrangements or whatever.  It's been a long time since anyone had to bail out on a session without giving everyone else several days' notice first.<br/><br/>We also talk about when we'll play at the very beginning, right along with what we'll be playing and who will be playing and character creation and all that stuff, so we can all be on the same page about what days we want to play on.  We also talk about how to handle absences -- if someone's going to be out of town one weekend, will we play without them or wait until they get back?  What if two people are missing?  Addressing those questions up front sets everyone's expectations properly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
