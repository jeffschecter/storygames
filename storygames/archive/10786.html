I've been itching to give this game a go since the Alpha came out, and the stars finally aligned.<br/><br/>Some background: recently I've become a part of a local collective of game designers. We meet monthly to discus issues of design, business, and marketing. This was the first of hopefully many regular "game nights" in which we try out a game to see what's going on design-wise. So we were playing with our game designer hats on. Which is a terrible way to play-test a game, I think.<br/><br/>None of us came prepared to run it. Well, one of us had printed out a few copies of the rules and brought the index cards, but hadn't prepared any content. I had just read through the rules a couple of times so I, even thought I came expecting to play, took on the GMing duties (at least for the time being). We also picked up an extra player who was hanging out at the FLGS and was looking for something to do.<br/><br/>We had a Mystic Agent named Aura Van Borealis, a Two-Fisted Professor named Professor Vega, and a Robot Detective named WALL-E 2 Judgement Day (who quickly went by the nickname "JD"). The players came up with some awesome "Previously On" scenarios which made me regret that I had already started writing up threats for my opening teaser. Fortunately we were able to work in those details later.<br/><br/>The opening teaser consisted of a giant robot octopus and its lazer-squid minions terrorizing downtown Rocket City. I probably had too many threats for the number of protagonists, but it played out really well with the players really torn as to what threat to attack. In fact a rocket school-bus full of children was completely destroyed because the patrol couldn't resolve it before it's count-down went to zero.<br/><br/>Turns out the whole robot octopus event was just a distraction: back at Danger Patrol headquarters, Professor Vega's recently acquired and innocent-looking alien pet had run off with a new device of his and sent it on a spy-rocket on course for Jupiter. <br/><br/>After that first fight and revelation we decided to try continuing the plot without a GM. I made a Robot Daredevil named EX1 and joined the patrol. We came up with threats by consensus based on ideas that came out of the original "Previously On" scenarios and our interlude scenes. The next set of "fights" were a bit disappointing. We had split into three groups to follow three different leads in an investigation, each group only having one threat to deal with. Not a lot of tension there. Well, except Aura got KO'd (due to having a high danger meter after the first fight and rolling bad). But it felt a bit flat nonetheless.<br/><br/>So we talked about this before our final fight and decided we needed another big fight with lots of threats for our final battle. There was some discussion that in a structured, GM-less Danger Patrol, there should be some sort of fixed threat-level to number of players ratio. In this case, the initial threats of the scenario could take about 30 hits (making each player responsible for doing about 7 hits). Normally a good challenge would require more/more powerful threats, but we figured most of us were already sitting with high danger meters and at risk of KO's or being Vaporized within a roll or two.<br/><br/>In the end, the bad-guys went down fairly easily. I myself had two perfect rolls (that's with trait die, bonus die, and the maximum of 5 danger dice), so a lot of that is due to luck. JD, the Robot Detective did get KO'd, though, so it was not without risk.<br/><br/>In the end, we took down a Stygian plot to steal Danger Patrol secrets using harmless-looking alien pets that were actually very clever and offspring of a huge, extra-dimensional summoned creature. We defeated the adepts, blew-up the mother creature, and barely escaped with our lives from the erupting volcano-lair.<br/><br/>The two things that really stand out for me in this game are the Danger Dice and the Danger Meter. Danger dice is a really cool way to conceptualize and reward narration in easy, bite-size chunks. Being asked for prosy narration in role-playing games can often be intimidating, so the limitations and focus that the rules for Danger Dice prompts are very welcome and provide visceral responses. And the Danger Meter really works to provide an interesting reward system and constantly escalate the tension and risks of a scene. Beautiful!<br/><br/>But we found a bit of an issue with the Danger Meter. Professor Vega's player pointed out that you play wild and reckless when you start out in order to boost the meter to the far end where you'll be rewarded. You're often talking as many Danger Dice as are allowed and narrating awesome things to get them. But once you get to the far right of the meter, you suddenly are strategically encouraged to play very conservatively so that you don't take a full hit and become Vaporized! <br/><br/>Is this 180 degree turn to conservative, refrained play something that's been discussed already in the various DP discussions (I've read a bunch of them, but not all)? John, is this something you've noticed and are addressing already in the Beta? <br/><br/>That all said, I found playing Danger Patrol to be one of those great creatively satisfying and fulfilling gaming experiences. Like Wushu, I find I'm able to bring more to the table when the game asks me to be inventive and imaginative.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239513/#Comment_239513" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T14:39:18+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  2:39PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome. Thanks for this great AP.<br/><br/>But GMless? You guys are crazy. What's next... <i>stakes</i>?<br/><br/>The "play conservative" thing hasn't happened in any of my games, but I heard about it another playtester's AP. Mostly I just squint and go, "Maybe you need to read the name of the game again." But seriously, yeah. It's a thing and I need to think about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239536/#Comment_239536" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T18:20:34+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  6:20PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't you get a full hit if you fail all of your dice?

I think you only get a full hit if you generate 4 Danger. So the optimal strategy is, once you're happy with where your danger meter is, never roll more than 3 dice.<br/><br/>The GM <i>can</i> combat this by making sure there are a few threats on the board with countdowns. If the players have to generate a number of hits within a given amount of time, they'll be encouraged to risk more dice. <br/><br/>Without countdowns and without the need to move your danger meter, you're better off with more conservative moves over a longer period of time.<br/><br/>EDIT: and I'm just indicating what the raw mechanics promote. Certainly the atmosphere of the game (include, as John pointed out, the title) and my love for exciting narration still make me want to roll lots of those little, red d6's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
