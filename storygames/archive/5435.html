They would give the GM (for lack of a better word) a group of story tropes/plots and themes that they want to see during conflicts in the tale; these become sort of a "character" sheet for the "STORY".<br/>\n<br/>\nThese would be there to drive the narration at times when the "random mechanic" or economic mechanic (think Mortal Coil spending pools)  that I am still trying to work out makes them become dominate in a scene...you could say I want to see if a system in which the story itself has "crunch" is workable...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe overall game I am working towards is based on the Gundam style of mecha anime which has a fairly structured story. The way I see the story mechanic working  into this is as you get closer to the "end" the elements you define become more pronounced in the resolution system and affect the outcome more often. <br/>\n<br/>\ncurious to see what people thing of this concept...<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks in advance...<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121869/#Comment_121869" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T08:29:08+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  8:29AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my fantasy heartbreaker critter, Legends &amp; Lore, the party has a character sheet indicating the bonds that tie them together as a team. Zooming out from that idea, really any aspect of a world, including its' own continuity and metaphysics, can be codified into a feats-and-skills set of trees which can build a narrative skeleton, upon which the players and their characters apply the flesh. Ryan Stoughton's touched on this with relation maps that weave together, and there's an RPG somewhere out there (whomever gives me the name wins a prize!) where relationship lines are drawn, and where those lines intersect, a conflict is explored.<br/><br/>Hope that helps to get the gears turning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122571/#Comment_122571" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T21:25:38+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  9:25PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you thinking of "It's Complicated"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122659/#Comment_122659" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T08:08:33+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  8:08AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's Complicated works in a sort of similar way, but instead of having a really structured narrative arc, (and holy cats, if I can play Trigun with your system, I am so there-- I think Trigun has the most tightly-designed and masterfully crafted plot I've seen.) the plot becomes background and the game itself is driven totally by characterization and emotional/relationship content.<br/><br/>Your character starts with very little definition-- just an Oddity (which is a deep-seated issue, or skeleton in the closet, or secret fundamental to who you are as a person), and a Dysfunction (a social issue which is an external manifestation of your internal problem). It's described best with "Due to [Oddity], I [Dysfunction." You connect these two types of traits on a game board, with lines. When your line crosses someone else's, you have to declare your character's relationship to the person whose line you crossed-- but only how your character feels, not the other person's feelings.<br/><br/>Scenes go in turns, and when it's your turn to own a scene, essentially you call the shots. As gameplay progresses, you add more Oddities and Dysfunctions, which causes more lines to cross, etc. Basically, you go from having a really broad, simple character (usually some sort of cliche or stereotype works well) in the beginning, to something much more complex and nuanced by the end. So it's kind of similar, I think? But from a characterization end, instead of a plot end. The last playtest version is <a href="http://dissolutegames.wordpress.com/2007/12/22/fatality/" rel="nofollow">here,</a> but I'm working on a version with, you know.. layout. And more explanation and things.<br/><br/>I really like your idea of having a character sheet of sorts for the game. It sounds a bit like a puzzle-- you give the GM all the pieces, and he fits it together as works best for the story overall. Is that right?<br/><br/>If the story is crunch-based, how much crunch is going to be elsewhere?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
