<p>So, I draw stuff.</p>
<p>I will, on occasion, draw stuff people asked me to draw.</p>
<p>I want to make a little money doing this.</p>
<p>So what I'm wondering, from the artists here (Jenn? I am sure you are not the only one) is your thought process on setting like a pricing scale for things. Do you charge more for pencils than inks? Colors? What do you use to gauge, like, what is a price that you're worth, what's a price that people will pay?</p>

                            I think the "indie ideal" ends up something like $100 for a full page b&amp;w, $200 full page color, with those bits getting divided up into halves and quarters as appropriate.  Some artists definitely go a fair bit north of that, but usually after they've got a track record established (I think).  Does that help?                        </div>

                            I charge about $100 for a full cover package (front,spine and back), but I do mainly vector/photomanip with some drawring if necessary.  I'd likely charge upwards of $200 for an entirely drawn, inked and colored cover ... but it'd look like shit, too. <br/><br/>That's why I'm in "Intermediate Life Drawing" this fall. :^)<br/><br/>I give price breaks on any illos, if the author requests a lot of them.                        </div>

Quite true.  And don't get too far into the habit of nailing down prices before you realize exactly how much time you're going to have to put into a piece.  Some illos I've done have taken 2 hours and some have taken 6, with revisions that the customer wanted.                        </div>

<br/>
Discovering your pricing structure is a real trial and error process. I have, just this year, found numbers and methods I am happy with and it took 3 years or so to get here.<br/>
<br/>
First, here's a question you have to ask yourself. What is your objective? Is it to make a living while creating art? Is it to get a little closer to making a living creating art? Or is it to just have fun creating art? This is key and  it determines how flexible you are. I'm paying the bills with my art, so I may be more demanding than other artists in the business doing it for a hobby. Everything is relative.<br/>
<br/>
Very important. I have discovered that you HAVE to time your art to really determine anything. I have a free project timing program that I downloaded. I time everything from initial research to the final and I keep records of the results. This tells me alot. It allows me to more accurately schedule and price. Time your work and, if your objective is to support yourself, you know how much you NEED to make for your art. (Regardless of Industry Standards.)<br/>
<br/>
Industry standards are $100 for full-page black &amp; white, $50 for half-page black &amp; white and $25 for quarter-page black &amp; white. Color generally doubles a price. I do not keep to these standards myself for lots of reasons, but it's good to keep this in mind when pricing. This is generally what publishers expect to pay.<br/>
<br/>
I don't post my rates in public, but I will e-mail you my current 8.5x11 rates breakdown if you like. (Though the page breakdown is only a guide. Each project is unique.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this has been helpful. Please feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear. <br/>
<br/>
Note: When my schedule clears up a bit in the near future, I'm going to start a thread all about RPG illustration where we can discuss things just like this in more detail.                        </div>

                            It's a case by case basis thing for me.  I'm more interested in doing interesting work than making a lot of money so that colors my pricing structure.  If I dig on the project I'll take less money.  If a friend is in a crunch I'll take less money.  If I ain't high on the project I'll charge more.  This goes for illustration, web work, and graphic design work that I do that is RPG related.  Outside that little world I have a pricing structure I use based on billable hours.  Like Jennifer said, it is trial and error to find that price point and methods that make you happy.  <br/><br/>K                        </div>

                            Don't forget the frustration factor. 8.5X11 B&amp;W line art character portrait at $100 vs. a quarter page grayscaled tablaeu of the citizens gathered in the town square for the May Day festival at $25?

                            On many Ars Magica projects, where we can't afford to spend as much on illos as anyone (us or the artists) would like, we've recently started supplying artists with actual game text and a general order ("one full page of art, in 2â€“3 images") and letting the artists choose the subjects they'd like to illustrate. This allows them to play to their strengths and create more likely portfolio pieces. They have to do a little more work (that is, they to at least skim the text), but almost to a person, all of the artists who've done work on that line under both this scheme, and the old regime (where individual illustration subjects and sizes were all dictated), have liked the new option better.<br/>
<br/>
So, giving artists flexibility and input can help them groove on a less-than-ideal payscale.                        </div>

                            One artist who worked on Perfect was willing to charge $25 for colour quarterpage and $100 for colour cover.<br/>One artist I've contacted for Boulevard will be charging $100 for b&amp;w (with spot red) illustrations (half page).<br/><br/>Those represent the two ends of the spectrum that I am willing to pay.<br/>$25 for colour quarterpage is really cheap, and I totally think the artist is undervaluing himself (but at the same time, I'm willing to seize that opportunity.)<br/>$100 for b&amp;w illustrations is about as much as I can afford to pay. If an artist charged more, my thinking would resort to, "Well, I could get 3 black and white illustrations from my other favourite artist, for the price of 1 illustration from you.

                            Joe, traditionally, it's bad form to publish the rates of freelancers (including artists, of course), because such things are often dependent on that particular project and what the freelancer's situation was at that time.  People might contact them to get art and expect to get the same rates, which may have changed drastically by now.  And people may pull the "But you only charged Joe $N!" card and then it gets ugly.  Jennifer has good reasons for emailing Shreyas her current rates (note how she was careful to say "current") and not just posting them for all to see.  So, unless you've cleared it with your freelancers first, you might want to edit your last post out of politeness to them. This comes from my own past experiences with such issues.                        </div>

                            Pricing by the size seems to be standard, but if you're going in the direction of working with people you consider something akin to peers rather than big companies, I'd price using a scale of time and effort instead. Be up front with your client, tell them why you're charging what you are and they'll probably be more satisfied with what they end up getting. Pricing by size seems so arbitrary and I think it usually means one party, the artist or the client, is going to get ripped off, whether they realise it or not (unless the client is easily impressed or the artist is hard up on cash).<br/><br/>Some of the elements to consider that'll add to the time and effort spent on a piece of art:<br/>- Perspective (complex cityscapes, no matter how small the illustration is, are going to slooow you down unless you're some kind of savant)<br/>- Colour (hand-painting/inking can be very time-intensive while colouring in something like Photoshop might be fairly simple)<br/>- Complexity of the composition (Squeezing a set number of objects into a certain space can be tricky)<br/>- Level of client input (In other words, the more picky the client intends to be, the more you should charge. Of course some degree of editing is to be expected, but micro-managing will sap the will of any artist and deserves a surcharge)<br/><br/>Again, these are guidelines for more casual stuff, where negotiation is an option. The big guys probably aren't going to give a shit one way or the other, since it's more of a buyer's market out there, what with the number of desperate artists out there.<br/><br/>And I'm speaking hypothetically here, I should say. I've done some freelance illustration, but always for charity, more or less. The money is gravy and I do it either for fun, because I want to help the client or because the exposure is better than the money would be.                        </div>

                            I agree with Keith, price your work on a case by case basis.<br/><br/>Pricing based on size and complexity doesn't make sense anyway, because when you need to draw something complex like a town scene on a quarter page, it's often much easier to draw it bigger and ajust the size in Photoshop. Pricing based on time and effort <i>also</i> doesn't work, at least not for indygames, because budgets are too low for a hourly rate that would make sense.                        </div>
