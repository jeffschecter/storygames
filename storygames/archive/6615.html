The game plays in 10-20 minutes.<br/><br/>One player is the stranger.<br/>The others are a group of friends.<br/><br/><b><i><span style="color: #666600;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The friends</span></span></i></b> must find some nice and normal names for themselves before the game start. You will all wear sunglasses, throughout the whole game. Try to be social and kind under your chosen name. You have been friends since childhood, and know eachother intimately. If any player say something about your past, then it is true. He/she will know, so trust them. You start the game by reminiscencing about your past, building characters as you go. Have fun making up relationships and mutual memories!<br/><br/><b><i><span style="color: #666600;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The stranger</span></span></i></b> will use his/her  real name, and try to be him/herself in the game (maybe a special version, but do not invent things about yourself). You have no sunglasses! You will sit down within sight of the friends, but not together with them. Move closer during the initial stages of the game (within the first 3-6 minutes), so you come within listening distance. If you hear something interesting, you may go over and talk to them. That is when the conflict of the game begins. Your goal is to make friends with some or all of these strangers, so be nice and positive. And be persistent! <i>You need friends!</i><br/><br/><span style="color: #660000;"><b><i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The conflict</span></i></b> </span>will surface when the stranger impose him/herself on the nice outing of the friends. The goal of the friends is to make this stranger go away, or to shut the f*** up, so they can continue reminiscencing. And they will be quite rude about it. No violence is allowed, of course, but you may poke the stranger in any verbal way you will. And you may be both loud and licentious! <i>That stranger is no friend of yours!</i><br/><br/><b><i><span style="color: #666600;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The end</span></span></i></b> comes in one of two ways:<br/><br/><b><i>- The stranger </i></b>may end it by starting to cry (real tears, nothing less). Then the game ends immidiately. The stranger may also end the game by walking off. If the stranger walk off the game ends the very second he/she steps out of the park. Either way: the game ends with the friends as winners!<br/><br/><i><b>- A friend </b></i>may end the game by removing his/her sunglasses, and giving the stranger his/her name (the invented one). If this occur the friend may invite the stranger to sit down with the group, or leave the group and sit down with the stranger another place in the park. Either way: the game ends with the stranger as the sole winner.<br/><br/><b><i><span style="color: #666600;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Afterhug is mandatory!</span></span></i></b> This is only a game, but the stranger may still feel a bit sore afterwards, so give him/her a nice, long group-hug after the game.<br/><br/><b><i>Go game!</i></b><br/>___________________________________<br/><br/><i>This game was brought to you by the Norwegian gamesmith Tomas HV M\xf8rkrid.

(oh, evil, evil me).<br/><br/>I promise to write a nicer game too, for parkplay, a real sunshine roleparkplaying game (RPPG). Wow!

It seems pretty self-controlling.  I don't imagine the super-competitive people what would be willing to hurt their friends would be into a game like this.  Similarly, assuming they have a moderate level of self-awareness, anyone that takes games so seriously they might be truly hurt by this kind of roleplay should know better than to play it, or at least know better than to play the role of the stranger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146936/#Comment_146936" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T16:25:43+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  4:25PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This really reminds me of my improvisation drama classes.
