As someone who looks at a lot of media and ponders which games would suit them, I got thinking that My Life With Master might suit Beauty and the Beast with minimal hacking. You could all play animated objects in the castle, although it would be much darker than the film, given that Beast would be 'master' in this instance. <br/><br/>Alternatively Hot Guys Making Out might work. I admit I don't yet have a copy, but I've heard a lot about it. The two titular guys could be the beauty and the beast of it, with the maid and butler roles being animated objects.<br/><br/>I think my main takeaway is wondering about a game with animated objects and the humans/beasts they have to deal with.<br/><br/>Would these systems be the most fitting or are there other games which might be interesting to use for this sort of story?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/miedvied" title="miedvied"><img alt="miedvied" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/miedvied">miedvied</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461589/#Comment_461589" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-02T16:59:51+00:00" title="April  2, 2017  4:59PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorcerer, naturally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461601/#Comment_461601" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-03T12:33:54+00:00" title="April  3, 2017 12:33PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most stories are fantastic when viewed through the MLwM lens. We had to cancel our regular Whitehack game the session before Christmas due players going on vacation, so the rest of us played a game with Santa as master and the elfs as minions. Come to think of it, neither minion was an elf actually; we had a tin soldier and a disguised human toy shop owner who tried to blend in as an elf.<br/><br/>Anyway, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_the_Ice_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">Breaking the Ice</a> with the Beauty and the Beast as PCs would be fun. In Breaking the Ice you do a switch: You pick a characteristic from each player and have the other incorporate it into their character. Apart from the obvious gender switch (having the guy play the Beauty and the girl the Beast), it would be interesting to introduce some other real-life characteristic to both make the story less predictable and also make it hit closer to home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
