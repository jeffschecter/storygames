Our last two playcons were immensely successful -- lots of RPGs and Boardgames were on the tables, and the rousing concensus has been "again!"</p>\n<p>The theme this time around, unintentionally thrust on us, will be "Slushy Maelstrom".</p>\n<p>If you're in &amp; around Ottawa, Ontario during February, please <a href="http://go-play.org/ottawa" rel="nofollow">drop by the GPO blog</a> and help get this puppy off the ground.  I'm planning on running two playtests - <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/storming" rel="nofollow">Storming the Wizard's Tower</a> and <a href="http://www.achtung-spiel.com/black_cadillacs.html" rel="nofollow">Black Cadillacs</a>.</p>\n<p>We're currently looking for help choosing a date, as well as for folk who want to pimp a game or two. Obviously, indie games are more than welcome. More importantly, there are absolutely no rules against selling product. For that matter...there are hardly any rules at all.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br/>\nD</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
