The characters won but had to escape the exploding citadel. On their way out the module describes a trap where spheres of annihilation charge the escaping characters. It's essentially save vs. death situation. 1 character died. At the end of the module the gods are so grateful for the character's deed they offer to resurrect any of their fallen comrades. <br/><br/>This was very lame. You earn a hard fought victory at the end of a campaign and kill a freakin god but a little black ball of energy slams into you as you're exiting the fight and bam... you are dead? Lame! And the offer of resurrection seems anticlimactic. At the time I thought it was a cool potential twist of an ending.<br/><br/>In retrospect I would have completely removed that whole part of the encounter.<br/><br/>As a GM, what is 1 thing you would have done differently?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195019/#Comment_195019" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T08:51:51+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  8:51AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was GMing GURPS in a fantasy setting and one guy had a very powerful and effective fighter who beat down all my cool bad guys with his bad-ass pick (picks are awesome in GURPS except when they get stuck in the viscera).

Now we were meeting for our premiere episode of play. I was DM. To make some things work in my story (alarm bells, anyone?), I had to have the PCs captured by the city's guard and charged with "stealing a day of time" (cool, right?) in a big ol' trial.<br/><br/>Well, the encounter leading up to the trial was a joke. The PCs were way out-numbered and out-gunned. A few players figured that out and went peacefully. <br/><br/>I ran the trial itself as a skill challenge. The players thought that, if they won the challenge, they won their innocence. No, I turned it into a farce. They won the trial and then I said, "They find you guilty anyway!" Railroading in the worst possible way. I justified it, "But now you KNOW they're crooked. You proved yourself innocent to everyone, and they didn't care." This did not sway the players much.<br/><br/>If I could do it differently, I would have talked to them up front about the stuff I needed to make some back story work. They had given me license to have some campaign back story and even do some railroading. I should have taken that license and said, "Hey, guys, let's start this <i>in media res</i>. You've just been gathered up and tried for stealing a day of time. Cool, right? And they find you guilty, even though it's clear they don't have any evidence except that you were all drawn to the orrery on a certain day. They are gonna throw you into prison and probably do terrible things to you. Of course, you will fight your way out of this, right?"<br/><br/>I could have gotten them to sign on for that. If not, I would have changed tack somehow, but I shouldn't have repeatedly beat them over the head with John Henry's hammer.<br/><br/>Part of my reasoning for railroading was that I wanted all the PCs to have been drawn to the orrery (a key astrological device in the story, and a clue to the time shenanigans). That would have made excellent flashback material, as each player got to show how he came to be at the orrery at a certain time. The fact that they would be captured and tried would be a "given," but they could use that information as context for their flashbacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195026/#Comment_195026" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T09:36:37+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  9:36AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm running <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8792" rel="nofollow">my current Mouse Guard game</a> and it's fucking boss.

My youngest brother is playing a dwarf.  He checks for traps on a hole in a wall.  Fails. Peers inside.  Needs to make a Saving Throw vs. Traps.  Fails.  Gets his head chopped off.<br/><br/>My brother freaks, breaking into tears.  Running outside as I try to comfort him.  And I'm all confused.  <i>I did what the game said to do.  Games are supposed to produce fun.  This is not fun!</i><br/><br/>My brother had every right to freak out -- his young age be damned.  Sure, someone older might have realized, "You know what, it's only a bunch of numbers on a character sheet."  But the bizarre arbitrariness of the game was insane.  He should have freaked out.  They were pointless rules, and if I could have done it all over again I would never have gone near that Saving Throw vs. Whatever crap.  <br/><br/>I pulled them from the game and never used them again.  And started figuring out ways to watch the fun for the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/smathis" title="smathis"><img alt="smathis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/smathis">smathis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195077/#Comment_195077" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T12:41:24+00:00" title="March  2, 2009 12:41PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was running a sort of <i>League of Extraordinary Gentleman</i> game for a group. It was kind of a homebrew, light system that was working pretty well. Sort of like <i>The Window</i>.<br/><br/>Each PC was based on a fictional character like in LoEG. No one had read LoEG but the group was really into it.<br/><br/>The setup was that a series of murders in Whitechapel were leaking out into the more posh areas of London. Her majesty was concerned that it was the return of the Ripper. In actuality, it was Johnathan Harker -- who had become a vampire -- and was killing victims throughout London. It was beer and pretzels. Meant to be more fun than anything accurate historically or even fictionally.<br/><br/>So, one of the PCs was Sherlock Holmes. The PC had the ability, like Holmes, to piece together a string of clues into a "fact" that would be real in the game world. It was a pure Narr ability. And because of its power it could only happen once an adventure.<br/><br/>So the player used the ability in the second session. And, with help from some other players, she pieced together all the clues into a solution that was pretty much cribbed from the pages of <i>From Hell</i>, only with a slight fantastical tweak. And I nixed it. I could feel the enthusiasm being sucked out of the room.<br/><br/>Allowing the explanation would've meant that I would be flying blind from that point on. And I really didn't want to rehash <i>From Hell</i>. I wanted Johnathan Harker, doggone it. Unfortunately, my group was wanting <i>From Hell</i>.<br/><br/>It was a dick move on my part. If I could take it back, I would.<br/><br/>Pretty much all of my GMing mistakes involve this sort of blocking. Fortunately, I have begun to recognize, even embrace, the No-Prep Fear I get when it's going down and block less and less. I've gotten more comfortable with being in uncharted (unprepped) territory and letting players know that they've taken things on a detour and I need a couple of minutes to figure a few things out. I've even solicited the group for direction a few times. That was a trick I learned by running <i>The Mountain Witch</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195138/#Comment_195138" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T15:21:43+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  3:21PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I could have gotten them to sign on for that.

SO MANY BAD DECISIONS.  But, in an effort to not draw from HS... I ran a D&amp;D 3.5E Eberron game a few years ago, that was fun whenever we weren't using the mechanics.  Then it would suck.  The Druid and the Artificer never kept track of their spells.  No one looted bodies and so encounters were overpowered, or I had to work in "some dudes give you a buttload of magic items" moments.  The gnome never picked an alignment.  But when those things weren't a big deal, we had fun.  What I SHOULD have done is said, "screw this, guys, we like the story and the characters, but none of us want to be playing D&amp;D.

I was the GM, and this is one of those games where the GM makes up a mystery and the players have to deal with it. With Hex Rangers, it's always supernatural, and it's the PCs' literal jobs to handle it, so that much goes down real easily.<br/><br/>They discover that there's this demonic fruit that sends folks into a blind cannibalistic rage. They're trying to figure out where it came from. I already know: there's a demonic tree in Gil Cutter's yard, out in the swamp, where he made a deal with spirits to get revenge on the folks who took his father's land, drained all its water so what land Gil still had was swamp, and put up an orchard there.<br/><br/>Somewhere, the players get the idea that the fruit came from the orchard. They start planning how to take down a <i>whole orchard</i> and get away with it (they are authorized by the US government, but required to be absolutely secret about the existence of the Hex Rangers).<br/><br/>And I goofed. I dropped meta-game, social hints that this wasn't the correct answer. One of the players picked up on it and suggested that they go check out Gil's house first, which of course was the correct answer.<br/><br/>I shouldna done that. What I should have done was let them go through with their cockamamie plan to burn down a whole orchard owned by wealthy folks who were gonna be sore about it, and ad-lib something about how, in the process of doing that, they discover another clue or two about the correct answer. That is, even though their hunch wasn't correct, it should have led them to the truth -- just like what happens in investigative fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195378/#Comment_195378" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T23:59:25+00:00" title="March  3, 2009 11:59PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2009 11:59PM by komradebob.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My worst moment was years ago in an old Call of Cthulhu scenario, the one with the kidnapped senator's daughter and the werewolf pack.<br/><br/>Anyway, after much investigation and a bunch of interviewing of locals ( mostly made up by me on the fly, and apparently confusing as hell to my players) the characters are off in the wilderness and get jumped by the werewolves.<br/><br/>And one of my players ( a good pal) who was playing a particularly obnoxious character concept that didn't fit well with much of anything ( IM then O), in the face of the werewolf ambush ( and prior to any of the players getting to the Big Reveal at the werewolf homebase) managed to gun down the werewolves one after another with a shotgun. <br/><br/>Bang-bang-bang, just like that.<br/><br/>And it pissed me off. I was <b>sure</b> that this was not at all the way the thing was supposed to end. I mean...Jeez... the investigation part of the scenario hadn't even been finished!!!<br/><br/>So, I let the werewolves slowly regenerate. Visibly.<br/><br/>The other PCs hit the road upon on seeing this.<br/><br/>But not my pal's PC. He sat there pumping lead into the bodies. Which, under the scenario rules, really should have done those lycanthropes in but good.<br/><br/>Still, it grated on me. So, I decided on the fly that only silver would actually kill these critters, which wasn't actually at all part of the critter design. The opposite in fact.<br/><br/>So I let the weres continue regenerating until the PC ran out of ammo. Then he ran, and the werewolves regenerated, chased him down, and ate him. The other PCs had long since ran back to town and survived.<br/><br/>If I could have done things over, knowing what I know now, all the rolls would have been in the open, and I'd have let the chips fall where they may. I'd have also encouraged more pre-game discussion of acceptable and unacceptable character concepts, with emphasis on player-to-player ( not just player-to- Gm) discussion of the point.<br/><br/>As it turned out, my pal, a fairly Game-y player, read said scenario after the fact and was exceedingly pissed. It became a sore-point for ages, actually. I've had other successes and failures as a GM, but that was the biggest one on an out-of-game level for me personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195500/#Comment_195500" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T12:16:37+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 12:16PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have remembered to bring the stupid character sheets, so we didn't all have to sit around while my wife drove back to the house for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195505/#Comment_195505" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T12:59:30+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 12:59PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would never have tried to GM that game of Pendragon on acid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195560/#Comment_195560" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T23:52:55+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 11:52PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have been more excited about the setting/changed it before I GMed Code of Unaris.

Huge mistake. The guy also happened to be something of a twit - a real gaming boat anchor - and the game, the genre, the whole thing really wasn't for him. Anyway, I should've just let him play a regular trooper and not have to give orders or anything and he would've been happy, or at least just kept his mouth shut. But I persisted, even when he deliberately tried to get his character demoted. I figured having the idiot in charge was in-keeping for a Catch-22 type game like 3:16.<br/><br/>That would've been fine if it was the player being on board with playing an idiot, but in this case the player actually *was* an idiot. And I let him torpedo the game - he starting having fits and if it weren't for the other players playing around his shit, it would've been a complete disaster.

The idea came up that we could do something in the pulp vein, more Indy/adventure than Doc Savage/proto-supers. I offered to run it and cooked up a simple plot around German gold and a system to use: basically I did an Unknown Armies remix.<br/><br/>In the end it turned out that the system didn't really offer us that much but, hey...! It wasn't really tested. I'd put more effort into that bit if I tried somehting similar again but the big thing I'd do differently is: to talk with the other players about how I want to run the game. <br/><br/>When I run games at Cons I can be the "take charge" kind of GM who propells the game. I don't wanna have to do that at home with my friends. For me, it's like cheating them out of what's fun in gaming. They don't necessarily feel the same way..... When the group found a charm hung in a tree in the jungle I really wanted them to state what it meant and why it was there. They in turn were a bit hesitant to make claims since I might have something planned (oh, I never have anything planned! At least nothing that can't be reworked). <br/><br/>The two-shot game was certainly alright by itself and offered more laughs than we'd had in a long time, but it still fell kinda flat. Basically, my expectations of how actual play would work really didn't match the player's expectations (whatever they were). <br/><br/>Classic mistake, eh? In hindsight I can't really understand why I just didn't tell them how I wanted things and asked what they'd like.Hopefully I'll not make this mistake again.

That post describes two character deaths, both in the same game for the same player, and the first was awesome, and the second was where I sucked.\n<blockquote>A series of events which deserve a post of their own unfolded in the game over the following months. In a session 20 July 1997, the Seven Ogres found themselves in deep trouble, trapped in what seemed like an impossible situation, fighting for their lives in the dungeons beneath the Iron Ring\u2019s headquarters.<br/><br/>It was a great moment in the game. Everyone was completely in the moment, thinking hard, entirely engaged, trying to salvage the situation and nervous as heck. The group cleared out a room, trying to set up a defensive position and take a moment to breathe. We were using miniatures and a dry-erase map of the room, and Jarratt moved Heywood near to the door to fight off the intruders there. He was hit by a paralysing effect from an enemy outside the room, one he wasn\u2019t aware of. Before he could be cut down by a threatening foe, another player sent his character in to pull off an unlikely rescue, successfully killing the attacker. It seemed the battle was won. The session was coming to an end, and it was a good point to end things until next time.<br/><br/>Then I made one of my Top 10 greatest GMing mistakes. I had the attackers force through one final strike before the room could be sealed. I targeted the vulnerable Heywood. The attack was a success. He died. <br/><br/>Everyone was dumbfounded. The reaction was the opposite of the earlier death of Campbell. This had been a cheap death, devoid of drama or appropriateness. It was a bad call. The players went into the night disconcerted, not energised.<br/><br/>The truth is, I wanted to raise the stakes in the game. I wanted to make clear that this was the climax and now they were playing for keeps. What I\u2019d had the enemies do was perfectly within the rules, but it didn\u2019t feel right, and it required a level of vindictive precision from the enemy that didn\u2019t really fit. Ultimately it wasn\u2019t fair.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/gametime/38096.html" rel="nofollow">The rest of the post describes what went down between me and the player afterward, and what I learned from it</a>. <br/><br/>Someday I'll write up the rest of my Top 10 Gming mistakes...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196503/#Comment_196503" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T20:03:03+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  8:03PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2009 8:06PM by madunkieg.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My biggest mistake in the whole campaign was not putting the story on rails.<br/><br/>Actually, my mistake was not properly reading the skill and playstyle of the players and altering the story to match.

Once swords and sorcery hit, though, they straight <i>demand</i> I craft an intriguing story, in which they then get to particpate. It seems to me in my group's chemistry there is a certain synergy involving sandbox play which says: "Hey gang, today you've got one hour to play in the Fantasy Castle box, before we move to the Hidden Jungle box.
