One is for freelancer/small company writers, and the other is for major company writers which at this point may be limited to Paizo and WotC).<br/><br/>As a neophyte if you successfully manage full-time small company/freelance work, you\u2019re likely looking at the poverty level for a household of one \u2014 $12k give-or-take. It is very hard to say what the upper limit for that is, and there will be outliers. I will say for \u201can Owen Stephens\u201d you\u2019re looking at an average pretty close to $25k/year. That average is, however, wildly useless for planning purposes. People I know at my current rate (which hasn\u2019t gone up in the past few years), have made as little as $15k, and as much as $42k. And as the company I am lead developer and part owner for (Super Genius Games) continues to grow, and other freelance continues to shrink, I may find myself wildly outside what I consider average for people at my level.<br/><br/>For a major company, you aren\u2019t likely to start for less than $27k, and I\u2019d consider $31k more typical. Getting to $50 over the course of a career is certainly possible. Exceeding $60k while remaining an rpg game designer is unlikely, though your career may well lead to different places, different games, or different jobs that do reach higher.<br/><br/>All of this is the wildest of estimation, so take it all with two grains of salt and a suspicious look.</blockquote>\nThose numbers ring true to what other people have told me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331330/#Comment_331330" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T12:21:44+00:00" title="June 23, 2011 12:21PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like how so many people answer "only if you're married to someone who earns money".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331334/#Comment_331334" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T12:51:01+00:00" title="June 23, 2011 12:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dislike how so many of the articles seem to assume that being a writer is the only real job in the industry; artists, layout, sculptors, etc don't seem to count at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331336/#Comment_331336" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T12:56:30+00:00" title="June 23, 2011 12:56PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My question these days is: why would you try to make a living in RPG design?<br/><br/>There are people doing this for fun, in their free time, putting out content that's on par with anything that was made as part of a full time job. Lady Blackbird is better looking than many "full-time" products, and John more or less just made it as a lark. Apocalypse World and Fiasco are some of my favorite recent games, and both Vincent and Jason have other jobs that (I presume) put the food on the table. They don't seem to need more time to develop their games, or more funding for art or whatever.<br/><br/>From what I can tell, once you're putting out a product that's your livelihood, you're less likely to take chances, more likely to push yourself, and more likely to burn out. None of those are absolutes, but they seem more common when what you're designing is your bread and butter.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say you can't make money. I will happily pay John, Jason, and Vincent (and many others) a fair price for their products. Hell, I'll probably give them a little more because they're great people who make great stuff. I just don't see why anyone would try to turn a fun, (presumably) profitable side-venture into a full time job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331339/#Comment_331339" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T13:25:33+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  1:25PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>layout</blockquote>\nI can speak to layout side of the business.

If something is your full time job you will get better at it, not worse. If you go from doing something as a hobby to spending all your time on it, you will get better at taking risks, because you will have a better understanding of what you are doing, what risks are fruitful, recognizing when to abandon a risky project, etc.; and you will be able to devote more time to taking risks (in absolute terms) even if more of your time (proportionately) goes towards 'non-risky' pursuits, because you will have more time in total to devote to the pursuit.<br/><br/>Artists who only paint on the weekend do not generally take more risks than full-time artists who are devoted to a career in art, because part of any creative pursuit is the ability to take taking risks seriously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331349/#Comment_331349" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T14:05:40+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  2:05PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see $50k profit a year (to pull the number from Owen Stephen's passage) in lumpley games' future, sure, piece of cake.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331350/#Comment_331350" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T14:06:04+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  2:06PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a financially unsuccessful designer, I managed to pay my own rent once.

That would lead me to much different decisions than I am currently making. Because I'd be making games for a financial need, not a creative one.<br/><br/>I didn't say anything about John, Vincent, or Jason not doing better work if they could just sit around, fully paid, and do it. Let's also ditch them as examples, so I'm not speaking for anyone else, though I know there are others who feel the same way:<br/><br/>If making games is my job, I need to hit a release schedule that can pay me when I need money. I need to worry much more about maximizing my games as product, instead of maximizing them as, well, games. I'm also not just sitting around making games, I'm dealing with the process that comes from either running a business or being part of a design team.<br/><br/>If I could continue to pull down my current salary and just design games on my own terms, that'd probably be a good thing, sure. But that's never going to happen, unless someone very rich decides they like my games very much.<br/><br/>Personally, I know that I'm happier designing games when my salary doesn't depend on it. I'm putting in love and care and experimentation, instead of a need to make sure I make rent. I can also make decisions based entirely on the product, not my financial situation. I can put my games out there free, or at cost, or with just a few bucks over so I can buy a beer. The entire thing stays pretty fun and fresh because I know my real job (which I also enjoy) will make sure I'm living comfortably.<br/><br/>I'm not saying to not do what you love. I love making games, so I do that. I'm saying that doing what you love and making your living from it aren't the same thing. I can't imagine ever trying to be a game designer full-time.

What the threads originally linked above seem to be arguing is that you can't make a living <i>doing it in certain specific ways that many people have tried before</i>, which doesn't mean that it's impossible.  It just means, if it's going to be possible for you, you might have to go about it in a very different way.<br/><br/>Like, to riff off Vincent's case, you could release a game -- designed largely based on your own preferences, not the demands of the market -- every couple years, make each one really good, and gradually build up a back-catalog of games and a large audience ready to purchase your next one -- all while maintaining a full-time job.  Basically, you follow the "indie game publishing model" and repeat this process until you're making enough every year to quit your day job or at least cut way back and work part-time.<br/><br/>But that requires a much more long-term plan than most of the linked threads have in mind: a ten-year plan at least.  And there's no guarantee that it's going to work, in the end, if you can't build up enough of a following.  But, in the meantime, it's much more economically feasible and totally under your creative control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331361/#Comment_331361" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T14:53:08+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  2:53PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2011 2:55PM by sage.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, thanks for reminding me to come back to that!<br/><br/>I totally buy Vincent's model. If, in the endgame, you find yourself able to give up your day job and sell games, that's totally awesome. That's also an outlier, there are only a few people operating on that level.<br/><br/>Maybe I should back down my rhetoric a little - I wouldn't make game design my full time job until it already was. Vincent's model makes a lot of sense to me: you sell what you want to make, on your schedule, until you find out that you're making that kind of money. Then maybe you make it your whole business.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm also coming from a different perspective than some other people? I love my day job, it's pretty rocking. I work in software. If I worked in RPG design, I'd probably be coding at night for fun. I probably like game design more, in absolute terms, but just barely. So I have a hard time imagining trading a job that I like that pays the bills for a job that I like that might pay the bills, some of the time.<br/><br/>I'm writing from the perspective that other people might be in the same spot: they have other options beyond game design that can pay the bills more reliably. For Joe, that's not the case, and that's cool.<br/><br/>So sure, I'm just talking for myself, of course. All I'm saying is that I don't see how game design as your full, real, job is appealing, unless you're at the point where it's already proved itself for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331365/#Comment_331365" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T15:06:35+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  3:06PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How many indie RPGs are for sale?<br/><br/>What percentage of those indie RPGs equal Vincent's sales? <br/><br/>Or half of Vincent's sales? <br/><br/>Or a quarter?<br/><br/>Or\u2026 you get my point!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Is Vincent's success an average? Or a statistical outlier?<br/><br/>But part of Vincent's success (in addition to being a brilliant, generous, talented, and hard working) is his ability to instigate, provoke, and draw attention to himself in ways that incite passion. Hence his, "piece of cake" comment. See, now I've fallen for it :-) <br/><br/><br/><br/>Unfortunately I've seen a decent number of people walk down the road of indie RPG failed publishing with expectations set too high as they look to people like Vincent as their benchmark. In many ways, Fred Hicks' blog post was probably one of the most healthy contributions I've seen to help combat over inflated expectations which can lead to people quitting prematurely and leaving self-publishing with a bad taste in their mouth.  <br/><br/>That doesn't mean we can't learn a great deal from Vincent. We can! But you could copy everything he does and still completely fail.

We could do the same thing, sure. But I don't think its something I'd bank on, which I feel like I see too often in people setting out to publish games.<br/><br/>I guess I feel like currently, we've got brilliant people making great games, with more all the time. More games than I can play already, more coming out, and more people making them. If more people try to make that their job, I don't really see what that benefits anyone. We'd get more games, but we already have a lot. They might have slightly nicer art and editing and such maybe? But I don't feel like there's much lacking there. What we would get is a lot more people who have to rely on their games to support them. At best that's just kind of neutral, at worst it means some lame stuff like games getting pushed out so you can make rent, or feeling bad for not buying someone's game cause now they're not getting dinner tonight.<br/><br/>We've got a pretty workable model going. If that model transitions to fully supporting some people, awesome.<br/><br/>I just think that the reasonable way to approach putting out your game, to begin with at the very least, is like a hobby that you want to share. Then you're not beholden to release schedules or sunk cost or any of that. You can make money of it, sure, because you're providing people with something they want. But trying to make that amount of money match the amount you need to live doesn't sound like a good idea to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331381/#Comment_331381" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T15:51:31+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  3:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The web comics community has this discussion. they are much larger and further along but comparable.

She could do this forever, but must spend time &amp; energy doing other things for money.<br/><br/>Game designer C makes games aimed at the market, that aren't really games she likes herself, but she works hard at it.

The games she loves could have been loved by the market if it were not for her falling into any one of a great number of pitfalls there are in doing business.<br/><br/>Things can go wrong when you self publish, sell to publishers or freelance for publishers, in all of these you are running a business. and that's an entirely different skill set then making a game.<br/><br/>As for the immediate re-coiling against the idea of "selling out" or rather modifying your work for an audience other then yourself, I think that's an ok instinct but there is quite a bit of gray area. Like editing, I rarely notice spelling errors, i was born that way. Yet I do my best to fix them because I know they piss some people off. Part of me also loves the Lisa frank color pallet, am i going to use it when it's totally inappropriate? no because i also like other color pallets. <br/><br/>There is a wide area of shared human experience we can draw from to appeal to others and still be true to who we are and what we want to do. i see nothing wrong with making smart choices about when you draw from this common pool.<br/><br/>And what about a completely different perspective, maybe we just want to make other people happy. We are not producing work because we personally enjoy the output but because we like the reaction other people have to it. i imagine children's authors do this quite often.<br/><br/>Sure there are totally cynical people who produce things they hate for people they hate but these people may as well work in the oil industry.

As a software company, I suppose you could say it's a special case. We've been around since 1993, and it took a good five years to make an acceptable living from it. Now we make a good living from it. I could possibly make more lucre in another field but enjoying your work every day more than makes up for that.<br/><br/>Pelgrane Press has one employee, and has for nearly a year. She is brilliant and basically made the job herself. As a result, it's really taken off this year. There are three freelancers at least who work with us who make a full-time living primarily from roleplaying games. More and more I am persuading contributors to take a split of margin rather than a word rate, though I lay out the figures for them. The skill sets of publication and writing do not necessarily overlap, and some people just want to write. For example, Ken and Robin suggest a bunch of stuff they want to write, and I just say "write it." I do give them a brief sometimes - stuff I know they will really enjoy. I suspect if I concentrated my all on Pelgrane, as opposed to running it on the side, I could make a reasonable living from it.

Selling a copy of your swank new game at GenCon is swell, sure, but may yield you $5 - $10 in profits after booth and travel expenses are paid for. Getting someone to play that game, love it, and return to purchase your other 5 games by mail-order or PDF sales will actually pay for a couple of days of rent. Until you have that back catalogue to rely on for real, sustainable income, don't quit your dayjob - and don't blow your savings on a hardcover, full-colour, 300-page, 1000-unit print run.<br/><br/>The "supplement treadmill" is what kept the bigger game publishers afloat for as long as it did, and that only lasted for so long before new editions and limited bookshelf space caused people to slow down and be happy with what they had. Since Vincent is our prime example in this thread, I'd like to high-light what I believe makes him so successful, other than his excellent design, hard work, and subliminal promotional activities - Vincent actually has a "brand" of consistent design following the same core game theory and values, with each game exploring a slightly different or more evolved viewpoint or theme, and the games are narrow enough in scope that you can't, won't, just play one forever until you croak. If you fall in love with Apocalypse World, you're going to also want to play Dogs, and IAWA, and Poison'd. Similarly, if you fall in love with Burning Wheel you're going to want to at least try Burning Empires or Mouse Guard, and if you love Spirit of the Century you're going to want to be chomping at the bits to try Dresden Files.<br/><br/>So, build a back catalogue, stay consistent with your values, explore new territory, and keep your games narrow in scope, until your income is stable enough that you can focus your efforts solely on game design. Make bigger and smaller games; promote yourself and your designs through free PDF games, mods or supplements to other people's games, and interface with (but do not be enslaved by) your audience. Don't try to create a magnus opus and expect to retire. Gamers today aren't hankering for a massive system-to-end-all-systems - or worse, setting-to-end-all-settings.<br/><br/>On the 1000 fans topic, I think it's feasible, but nobody's really figured out the magic sauce that makes today's relatively liquid RPG gamer consistently loosen their purse strings in support of their hobby. I'll easily drop $30 for a WFRP3 supplement, but I know well-off gamers who won't pay $20 for a whole RPG - and even I will balk at ponying up $20 for a PDF. Fantasy Flight sells a bazillion board games at $80 a pop, but getting someone to pay $50+ for an RPG core book is painfully difficult. I'm guessing most groups spend a combined $20 - $40 just on snacks and drinks for their weekly sessions. My 14yo's Warhammer 40k army has cost him (well, me, in the end) over $200 so far, and he barely plays (I don't even want to think about his Magic cards). When someone figures out a new formula for getting gamers to put $20 / month into their hobby, this will become more feasible. Of course, RPGs being an intrinsically creative endeavour, the eternal question is how to deliver $20 of value to a player of your game per month when they are essentially generating 90% of the value themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331485/#Comment_331485" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T12:01:27+00:00" title="June 24, 2011 12:01PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>This may be totally off the wall, but I'd love to do an experiment wherein approximately $15,000 was raised and awarded to a designer so that they could take 6 months off their day job and do nothing but design a game - sort of a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_grant" rel="nofollow">genius grant</a>for game designers.

That was/is one of the core tenants of the Design Matters booth - we carry stuff that's been released between the last years Gen Con and that Gen Con, cuz nothing else sells, really. <br/><br/>Supplement treadmill is one way to do this (and it can be done well - look at Pathfinder). Another is as Lachek says above, where you have new products that are in a conversation with your previous products, so someone who gets into your new release is inspired to investigate your back catalog (hmmm, more like how albums work, now that I think about it...)<br/><br/>Anyway, I've been selling games since 2005 and my profit (not income, but profit!) on it is still just barely more than a rounding error on my taxes. I'm super-niche, spent basically 1.5 years working on the same game over and over, and took 2 years off for school - which means, I suspect, that I'm much more of a "typical" indie publisher these days. Like everyone else, I have plans! But I also have a career that I want to pursue in the field I went to school for, which will hopefully have an overlap with my rpg work, but might not. I'm not gonna hamstring that by putting all my energy into something that I know I won't see a return on for at least a couple of years!

CCGs have collectabilty and deck-building aspects. Minis games have an almost endless supply of possible projects to work on alone and in your own freetime at your own pace.<br/><br/>2) Boardgames, CCGs, and Minis gaming are all designed around playing one-offs that have pretty clear startings and endings. That you can and want to come back and play again is part of the fun. Sometimes there are carry-over game aspects from one-session to the next, but carry over play is not absolutely necessary to the core fun of the activity.<br/><br/>3) Boardgames, CCGs and Minis games, while rewarding mastery of game subtleties, tend to be simple enough in their core concepts that first time players aren't completely at the mercy of master players. Naturally, this varies to an extent. Chess and MtG or even WH40K tend to be a bit unforgiving of the newcomer vs. the vet, but players of those games, even vets, rarely bring a total cut-throat A-Game when introducing new players.<br/><br/>4) It's okay to play your next CCG, Minis Game, or Boardgame with an entirely different crew of people. I guess this kinda goes along with point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>5) All of those types of games have components required for play that are not easily home-made.<br/><br/>6) All of those types of games tend to be rules-short compared to most Classic RPGs, and even shorter than most indie-RPGs. This makes it more likely that a broad variety of folks are more willing to actually read and digest the rules.<br/><br/>7) There are visual and physical components in those games. You can show people stuff that they can hold onto in seconds, and they'll kinda instantly get at least a rough idea of what is going on.<br/><br/>I've long imagined what it must have been like for some Hasbro manager setting down with the WotC guys to discuss D&amp;D after it had been acquired and only then discovering that most D&amp;Ders never used miniatures in their games. I'm sure uncomfortable hilarity ensued quickly.<br/><br/>8) Very few RPGs of any sort are easily played within a few minutes of "opening the box".<br/><br/>The exceptions to that I see around tend to be free games, like Lady Blackbird or a number of Matthijs Holter's games.[Edit: And a number of 5 minute Games and RolePlaying Poems as well]<br/><br/>[Edited to add] I don't know if this will at all help either, but I sometimes really think designers start from a sort of back end when putting games together. They come up with a really great game idea, and only after it's all done do they put together anything resembling a starter scenario. That starter scenario is the real seller for me. In fact, I'd probably rather pay for that and get other stuff for free than the other way around. Or at least I'd rather get the stuff most folks consider the core of their product as optional supplements or add-ons or advanced rules packages at a cost. That would follow more closely my own buying patterns for other sorts of games.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's because I just plain see the game in question as an intriguing idea that I can't see playing more than once or maybe just once in a while. Dogs in the Vineyard, Spione, and Steal Away Jordan all kinda hit that spot in my personal thinking.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, I don't know exactly how those things fit in with making RPGs or SGs for a living, but they might well be worth pondering on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331498/#Comment_331498" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T12:33:10+00:00" title="June 24, 2011 12:33PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>This may be totally off the wall, but I'd love to do an experiment wherein approximately $15,000 was raised and awarded to a designer so that they could take 6 months off their day job and do nothing but design a game - sort of a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_grant" rel="nofollow">genius grant</a>for game designers.

As I mentioned, the key question - in fact, the key question to ask yourself when you want to go into any legitimate business venture - is "how can I generate value". Your points all generate value.<br/><br/>1. On Lonely Fun - I have paid money for, and quite enjoyed, Tony Dowler's "How to Host a Dungeon". I've also caught myself enjoying countless hours of prep work for games as disparate as D&amp;D and Sorcerer, even when the games themselves fell down in play. Lonely Fun is absolutely a selling point, even for games as social as RPGs.<br/>2. Clear starts and ends, no carry-over required - I've purchased many games on the major selling point that they play in an evening and require no prior prep. I've gotten more play out of Zombie Cinema than most heavy, much more expensive games on my shelf.<br/>3-4. Easy to pick up, play with different people - you can introduce the rules for games like A Penny for my Thoughts or Lacuna to a new player as you play and they'll pick it up right away, which means you can start (and finish - see #2) a game with any pool of players you happen to have available.<br/>5. Not easily home-made = value. I'd rather pay $10 extra for a game that includes the cards, or $20 extra for a game that includes the board, than spend time printing and cutting and gluing (hear that, Montsegur 1244?!?) - especially if the acquired product looks more professional. Again with the Zombie Cinema, which I think cost me in the neighbourhood of $40, a purchase I'm most satisfied with. Clearly, the WFRP3 supplements play right into this as well.<br/>6. Rules short - not sure if I agree, but I will agree that the <i>basic</i> rules of games like WH40K and M:tG are straightforward and easy to pick up. In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say that the extremely in-depth corpus of optional / modular rules surrounding these games increase their longevity. Similarly, perhaps, the basic core mechanics of games like WFRP3 and Burning Wheel allow the players who want a little taste to play, and those who want more complex experiences to dig deeper.<br/>7. Visual / physical - see <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>. Absolutely agree. Games with components tend to do better these days than games which exist entirely in books and brains.<br/>8. Playable out of the box - A Penny for my Thoughts allows for this, as does Zombie Cinema and the games you describe. However, I'll also posit that "Lonely Fun" and "Short Rules / Playable Out of the Box" are potentially mutually exclusive, and a designer may only need to cater to one or the other approach.<br/><br/>As one antithesis, I think games which are very setting-heavy actually detracts from these points.<br/>a) you want me to read this whole setting before I can run the game, which conflicts with 6 and 8 and only marginally benefits 1.<br/>b) you probably want my players to read parts of the setting too, which conflicts with 3 and 4.<br/>c) exploring a pre-defined setting again is not as much fun, which conflicts with 2.<br/>d) most of us enjoy setting-creation, and providing it as gospel conflicts with 1 and 5.<br/><br/>All interesting points for any game developer who wants to sell their games - and who perhaps wants to build a catalogue of games which all provide customer value - to a reasonably-sized audience to consider.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331506/#Comment_331506" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T13:12:59+00:00" title="June 24, 2011  1:12PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I raised $13000 from Stealing Cthulhu preorders.

Becky Thomas of the Roleplay Workshop has been GMing as a full-time job for over a dozen years. Next year I will have made more delivering RPGs as a service than I ever did writing them as a product - infinitely more if considered as a reward-to-effort ratio - notwithstanding having freelanced for what I believe to be the industry's best-paying client (WotC). And from talking to Israelis, I would bet that service providers in that one little country over the last five years have earned more work-for-hire income than all the writers and designers in the history of hobby gaming.<br/><br/>Some of this is just the kind of working hard, and dealing with how your own psychology tends to get in the way of that, which can make any business a success, almost all of which will have a higher margin than the RPG biz. But the other key element here is that Becky, myself, and probably hundreds of Israelis of whom Uri Kurlianchik is the best known, work with kids.<br/><br/>The reason that working with kids matters is that this is a sector in which a) there is an existing market of people who are eager to pay you to entertain and educate in a way they can't themselves, or maybe just be a babysitter, and b) you aren't competing with a lot of people who will do that work for free. The would-be professional GMs I've known who have failed have done so because they haven't done stuff with kids; in at least one case (Captain Commando) this was after I sat them down said "look I've been exploring this market for years, I don't know anyone who could make a living as a GM for adults only who isn't already famous enough to make a living self-publishing RPGs or fiction, but I know for sure you can get paid to teach kids how to play RPGs."<br/><br/>Caveats:<br/><br/>- I haven't given up hope on selling RPG services to adults. Recently my company hired someone to do a <a href="http://www.adventuringparties.com/blog/dd-bachelor-party-invitation-and-origins/" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D bachelor party</a> and it was a success both for the clients and for the company. Turning this kind of occassional party planner/entertainer gig into a steady thing is probably achievable for someone with different skills and interests than myself.<br/><br/>- Since I am one of the bazillion people who would do it for free, I'm also still interested in trying to get paid for RPGs as a product; I showed off pics of my latest newborn to some nerdNYC SGers tonight and will post in Directed Promotion soon, and I definitely agree with <a href="http://nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=641423#p641423" rel="nofollow">Eppy's comments over there</a> that new developments like Kickstarter mean that self-publishing is much less likely to mean "doing it at a net loss" than when I was last a publisher, in 2008.<br/><br/>- Some long-standing successes in the self-publishing hobby games biz, like Chris Clark, make it for similar reasons services for kids do: "there is a market for silly quick-play games"; "I am not too good for that market"; and "hardcore roleplayers might need fancy production values, but folks in this market will be delighted that the bear dances at all."<br/><br/>- The fact that many of my favorite SF authors make less than gaming freelancers do - a fact which continues to fill me with dismay - is certainly related to the fact that this is also something people want to do for free. The contradictory fact that many more people want to buy fiction vs. RPG books may be explained by the maturity of the mainstream publishing industry, in which case we would expect RPG publishers to evolve towards greater ability to leverage this competition and cut authors' share of the profits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331548/#Comment_331548" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T00:04:46+00:00" title="June 25, 2011 12:04AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>But there's still a common lumpley thread of design approach and values running through all the games, even though they play out very differently - and that will entice someone to buy it, even if they might not like it after they've tried it.</blockquote>\nReally?

I actually thought about starting another thread discussing the feasibility of RPG event organization  as a stream of income. I have some pretty strong feelings on the subject. As the owner and one of the lead organizers for <a>HammerCon</a>, despite our success, I'm convinced I'll never make more than con beer money off the hundreds of hours I sink into the con every year, and I'm OK with that. Yet I keep hearing from people with serious plans to quit their dayjobs and make their living from running games, or other sources of revenue surrounding event organization (ranging from snack sales to elaborate pyramid schemes).<br/><br/>I'm very conflicted on this topic, because I do believe that a good experience = good value, which makes delivering a good experience a legitimate business case; I do believe that in RPGs, in the end 90% of the value is generated by the people at the table, not by the books, dice, minis, or the author/designer; those things combined should make the idea of a GM-for-hire business model very appealing to me. But for some reason I balk at the concept, not only because the business cases I hear tend to be poorly thought through or pie-in-the-sky, but mostly for ideological reasons. It cements the GM as The Funbringer, leading to an uneven distribution of responsibility. It merges the roles of Host and GM. It forces the GM to take ownership of the experience, leading equally to pandering to whims and blocking actions. It relieves the players of their responsibility to contribute to the game. And so on.<br/><br/>I do, however, very much like the idea of an "RPG Coach" for kids. That relationship is already unbalanced in terms of power distribution, so use that power for good, set good examples, teach good habits. I see that more of a transition period - like, I'll start you off on your campaign or game journey during these 2 weeks of RPG Camp, and then you'll be playing on your own - than an ongoing stream of income, like $5 / person / session for the next 20 years.<br/><br/>Edit: Posted a new thread about Gaming As A Service, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=331559" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331611/#Comment_331611" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T17:07:39+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  5:07PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/><br/>Really?

Usually the artist's stories are riddled with failure, luck, hard work, and mistakes. Often people think of art as a past time to be enjoyed and not a career at which you can make bank. But if you want to be a successful artist you really have to work hard, love what you do, and keep doing it forever.

I know publishing and gaming are completely different arenas than craft shows and Etsy, but it seems like a lot of the principles are the same when it comes to getting started and being persistent and having good ideas that people love.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332046/#Comment_332046" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T07:44:08+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  7:44AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely, anansigirl\u2014I'm getting a lot out of this discussion in terms of my desire to be a professional composer.<br><br/>Matt                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332085/#Comment_332085" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T12:10:54+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 12:10PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kira, absolutely.

What I mean is that the path to a fiscally sound publishing model might not start with such big investments. If you have access to a computer and the Internet, you can design, build, publish, and distribute a complete roleplaying game with $0.00 investment. Even if you sell your game as a $2 PDF, that's over an infinity percent return on investment.<br/><br/>And your overhead, as low as it is, is only getting lower as new technology and tools become available each year. Hell, fans now pay you to publish games <i>BEFORE</i> the games are published. That's fucking nuts!<br/><br/>This is sort of the backbone of the model. It's not risky or expensive to publish anymore. Hasn't been for a while, but it's getting even less so. So, while you have a day job, you can noodle around and take risks with your design instead. Then you send it out there, see what sticks. Over the years, you build up a body of work that has its ebbs and flows, but gains a certain reliability that you gradually lean on. Certainly you'll have to keep designing. And there will never be zero risk, but the same holds true for any nine to five. And what's more, as early as 2013, we're going to look back on 2011 and wonder how ever got along without AudienceFinder.com and Apple's new <i>i</i>Matter printer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332236/#Comment_332236" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T08:54:40+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  8:54AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eppie, that investment is only $0 if that's what you value your time at.

Your time is valuable. And you should be compensated for it.<br/><br/>The beauty of publishing what you create is that you don't have to put in all the guesswork a publisher does. You don't have to figure out ahead of time how much your time is worth. For instance, I don't have to look at myself and say, "Well, I think 400 hours of this lazy d-bag's time is worth $12,000 to me," and then find some way to raise that $12,000.* I can wait a few years and take a look at exactly how much that time has actually been worth to me. And if at that point, it doesn't measure up to my own standard, then I can make a very serious, informed decision about what I'm doing.<br/><br/>But ultimately Sage is right. Some hours are easy to count, like the 26th time I've rewritten a page or the hours spent adjusting and readjusting a table because I don't know squat about layout or my layout program. Some hours you feel lucky counting, like all the design work and doodling. And some hours, like the hours I spent researching some of the greatest fantasy adventure fiction ever written or the hours I spent in a cafe running my design issues past trusted friends, feel like cheating. At some point it's hard distinguish those from the hours I spent cooking my lunches or the 15 minutes I spent each morning making my coffee--without which none of this would be possible.<br/><br/>I mean, I made a fart joke on Twitter that directly resulted in a sale. The metric can only go so far before it starts creating meaningless data.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>* Although, with the advent of Kickstarter, I absolutely could do this, again with minimal investment and risk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332285/#Comment_332285" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T12:28:52+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 12:28PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Top things that influence my game design: reading comics, reading books, and drinking beer with friends.

But then we're not having a chat about how to make a living doing that.<br/><br/>If you're doing it for fun, with no eye towards getting any sort of payoff out of it, then yeah! Putting a game together is the same as knitting, or surfing Facebook, or sinking a hundred hours into Final Fantasy Infinity. But if you're looking to calculate any sort of return on investment against sales of that project/product, then you have to be honest about every aspect of your investment.<br/><br/>I definitely get what you're saying about time spent on the influences of your work not being counted, I agree! Steven King doesn't need to amortize the time he spent listening to Ramones records against the hours he actually spent at the typewriter.<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332432/#Comment_332432" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T05:46:44+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  5:46AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>But if you're looking to calculate any sort of return on investment against sales of that project/product, then you have to be honest about every aspect of your investment.</blockquote>\nNobody's being dishonest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332561/#Comment_332561" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T15:21:17+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  3:21PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not just that you have to calculate in your work hours on a product in order to calculate your "rate".<br/><br/>You also have to figure in those hours in regard to how quickly you can get product out.<br/><br/>If it takes you 400 hours to put out a good solid project and promote it and all that, you aren't going to be able to do that once a month, unless you figure out a good way to cut out time for sleeping, eating, defecating, etc.<br/><br/>So yeah, some of the hours feel like "fun" more than "work", but you still have to do them in order to get the product out and they are still time you aren't spending on other things.<br/><br/>The "time you aren't spending on other things" part is particularly important for those who are in the stage of life where they are starting to think about things like getting married and having kids. The amount of time you have to dedicate to creative endeavors is HUGELY impacted by things like that. Especially when you mix pre-schoolage kids and a job where you are working from home.<br/><br/>Sure, you might occasionally get a great game idea while you're in the middle of changing the baby's diaper (and I'm rather scared as to what that idea might be), but for the most part, time spent taking care of kids is not time spent working. Granted, some folks are a little better at that sort of thing than I am. But I thought I'd throw out another consideration for those who might be running the numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332566/#Comment_332566" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T16:03:54+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  4:03PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>We get paid.

It sounds like Evil Hat made a very significant amount of money, above and beyond paying all the people involved. So it's not particularly counter-indicative to making a living, but in fact a suggestion that you can not only make a living but even turn enough of a profit to be able to invest in even more people making a living -- or you making even more of a living, depending on your preference. I assume that $200k is not going to go towards buying materials (unless Fred has decided to start publishing gold-plated rulebooks), but towards paying new people to do new things. The primary investment in RPG design, as many have pointed out in this thread, is the time of the designer. <br/><br/>So... maybe I just misunderstood your tone, it sounded like you were adding some sort of caveat or warning. Being able to reinvest in the business above and beyond paying your own salary -- which is absolutely an investment in the business, in practical terms, even though it gets labelled differently in financial terminology -- suggests that making a living is more than possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332601/#Comment_332601" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T21:02:56+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  9:02PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>But if you're looking to calculate any sort of return on investment against sales of that project/product, then you have to be honest about every aspect of your investment.</blockquote>\nNobody's being dishonest.<br/><br/>Poor choice of words, sorry!

I don't carefully track my time - when called upon, I much prefer to pay myself by the word, like a writer - but I can make some good guesses.<br/><br/>I've got a full time job, a family, I do most of the dinner cooking, I go to violin recitals, I like to have internet arguments, I play some games and watch my fair share of movies and TV. I can only spend a few hours a week designing and publishing games. In the final weeks' rush up to release, I might spend 10 hours a week on a game, but usually, nothing like that. 5 hours a week when I'm actively working on a serious project, maybe, and 1 or 2 most of the time.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard took me at most 200 hours to create, top to bottom. At the moment I published it, it had paid me back $0 per hour, naturally. A year out, it had paid me back, oh, not super lots, maybe $15 per hour? It's existed for 6 years now, and it's paid me back something insane like $225 per hour. No lie!<br/><br/>It's not like a job, for sure. You don't get paid while you're working, so if you've got bills, you might want to find something more timely. But also, you keep getting paid, year after year, for the work you did back in 2004. If I'd been able to pick up more work in 2004 instead, maybe I would have, but there's NO WAY it would have turned out as well. Those were the most lucrative 200 hours I've ever spent, ever, doing anything.<br/><br/>The big problem I see, for me and the question of making a living, is that even if I were suddenly able to spend 40 hours a week creating games, could I? I can see doubling my production, I think, if I could spend 8 hours a week on games instead of 4. Just maybe - creating games is awfully hard. But ten-timesing it?
