I naturally chose to use <a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/pta.html" rel="nofollow">Prime Time Adventures</a>. As we played through the series, I could tell as Producer that my players weren't meshing with the system. They wanted to feel the challenge of dealing with the weirdness of the week and also have their characters change and be changed by events. The game ended up being fun, but I had to, as I said to one of my players "bend it so hard out of shape that I was wincing at the sounds it was making". <br/><br/>It's not that I haven't had success running PTA in the past, it was that this play group wanted something like PTA, but also distinctly different. Since the same players wanted another season the next year I elected to rework the PTA system into something that would actually support what my players wanted, dropping things like the largely unguided single player narration and the mechanically fixed characters, while retaining parts like screen presence and central issues for characters. I also wanted to make the game a little easier to play with a player who had left town, but wanted to Skype in. I borrowed pieces from <a href="http://memento-mori.com/inspectres/" rel="nofollow">Inspectres</a>, <a href="http://www.atlas-games.com/unknownarmies/" rel="nofollow">Unknown Armies</a>, and in retrospect Nine Worlds too. <br/><br/>And the hack worked pretty well, enabling things like a character discovering she was a sleeper alien, gaining and losing relationships, and general mayhem. The episodes were exciting, building to a series of dramatic climaxes in both the lives of the characters and their jobs as Torchwood agents. I worked out some kinks, but I've been generally happy with the hack as is. So I've decided to post <a href="http://archimedes-closet.com/artemisia/gamehacks/PrimeTimeSciFi.html" rel="nofollow">Prime Time Sci Fi</a>, a PTA hack for playing science fiction adventure serials (like Stargate SG-1, Torchwood, or Warehouse 13). <br/><br/>I'm curious about what folks think, or otherwise what sort of games you use to play science fiction adventure shows. <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382411/#Comment_382411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T04:57:34+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  4:57AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks interesting.

Everyone had it because they were all mages, so they could draw on it whenever they did something macical, basically. It's sort of a magic "Men in Black". It's present day, and they're agents of TSA (Thaumaturgical Security Agency, although originally it was just "Top Secret Acronym"). They're stationed in an abandoned church in Eunice, Louisianna and are officially working for Homeland Security, because everyone would be too afraid to ask what the hell they were doing in Eunice. Words like "Patriot Act" and "Guantanamo" tend to discourage questions.<br/><br/>As for your question, <i>anything</i> can be run episodically. To reverse the question, what would be the problem of doing it using the underlying AW rules?<br/>The reason why this is so hard for me to answer is that running episodes is the way I've always done it except for con-scenarios, and 20-something years of habits are hard to break. Basically all you have to do is figure out the start of the session, keep things interesting and see where the story goes, and end it on a proper note. Me, I like to end on a cliff-hanger.

I trust you had some reasons for why it would be better than using, say, the Wanton Role-Playing System. <br/><br/>In any case, some particular concerns that come to mind. Apocalypse World doesn't provide much support for pacing (countdown clocks come to mind, but not much else). At the same time it incurs a sizable extra cognitive load on the MC to play as written (actively keeping in mind the MC principles and moves), which make it harder to staple on social procedures to pace out for a particular session time and a making sure get to a conclusion*. Some of the underlying systems will fly in the face of pacing: move snowballs and making things seem real. In general I really wish Apocalypse World gave you more tools to use as the MC, specifically procedures and mechanics which could ease the load - that would certainly make it a less tiring game to run. <br/><br/>So I'm reticent about forcing Apocalypse World into a social form factor and narrative structure I'm looking for. I could be wrong, but I need at least something more to re-evaluate my conclusions. What do you propose?<br/><br/>   - Mendel<br/><br/>*Cliff hangers are problematic when you can't be sure if the player of the character hanging from the cliff by their fingers will be able to make next session. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382445/#Comment_382445" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T12:26:59+00:00" title="June 15, 2012 12:26PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

When I run con-scenarios (I pretty much only run games at Fastaval, so if you know the types of games played there, you'll know what I'm talking about) as well as when I run my campaigns, I simply yell "CUT!!!" about two seconds before a scene is completely played out, or on a great one-liner that can lead into the next scene.<br/>The reason I cut before the scene is completely done, is that it means a small amount of frustration for the players. As that frustration mounts (it all adds up), the players heighten the pace, playing more intensely because they want their stories told. They want their say.<br/>And they get it, it's not as if I cut a scene halfway through, I cut it just before it winds down completely, after the actual conflict is resolved.<br/>Doing it this way, as I said, makes for more intense play. Not because everyone start talking faster to be heard, but because they begin to get to the heart of the matter much, much sooner. They leave sift away the bullshit and get straight to the gold.<br/>It takes practice to do well. Lots of it. And, hell, sometimes I even have to interrupt a scene if there's too much babbling and ask them to start over, a lot like a stage or movie director.<br/>This doesn't mean that there isn't time for contemplative, slow play. There is, most definately. There has to be room for silence, because in games, like in music, the silences are the most important. And sometimes I deliberately let the silence run too long, not much, but 30 seconds of awkward silence seems a long time, and this, too, feeds the machine that is the emotions of the players.<br/><br/>Do I screw up, occasionally? Hell yes. But not often.<br/><br/>Now, just in case you think this is something that's easiest to do with friends who're used to it, you'd be wrong. At cons I run hard, as in emotionally challenging, games for complete strangers, some of whom come from a D&amp;D or Gurps background, and some who've never played at all before. These are games where there are usually no mechanical rules at all. There are structural rules, social contract, narrative rules, but rarely dice, or cards or anything like that to get in the way of the story or the pacing. That's why I like the basic premise of AW and PtA. You have a randomizer (dice, cards) that works <i>fast</i> and supports the narrative and keeps things interesting. Helps a lot for a GM, too, because you don't have to prep a lot, you can let the story emerge from consensual reality.<br/><br/>Oh, Roger, btw, just read your comment. We've always used the rules for PvP in my PtA game. Funny thing is, sometimes the player on one side of the conflict will give fan mail to her opponent because they feel it'll make for a more interesting story. I think it's all about how your group is used to playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382879/#Comment_382879" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-20T08:44:36+00:00" title="June 20, 2012  8:44AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger,<br/><br/>The NPC rules don't actually make them more like full-blown PTA characters so much as to distinguish between important and background characters and to have a clearer way to relate winning a conflict to affecting the characters other players may have introduced. This ends up working really well with the Growth option, since an interesting character can become a main character's relationship during the session.<br/><br/>Stress tracks take over the role of issues and some of the producer's budget, but focus more on how characters take risks and change, rather than what conflicts they tend to be in. I always found issues a bit one-dimensional, but I know other folks are really into them. <br/><br/>I got my copy of PTA back last night, so I can double check some of these things, but the Player versus Player is just a direct translation of what is in the original game. The same with the "limitations" on fanmail. Indeed, this hack is less limited on awarding fanmail than the original game, allowing the same player to award multiple different players during a scene. <br/><br/>Tore,<br/><br/>Your "Cut!" mechanic seems to work well for you. I have a fondness for mechanics which communicate the state of the story and game, and the spent stakes accumulator hits that spot for me and allows me to fine-tune the pacing to sessions of various lengths and attendance.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383017/#Comment_383017" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T16:31:17+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  4:31PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sci-fi TV in general makes me think of a rule that would improve the economy in many PtA games: once per episode, when you and another player have dialogue that would launch a thousand fanfics whilst not actually being about sex, you both take a fanmail at the end of the scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
