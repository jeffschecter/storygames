My second "guest host" spot is up, called <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/?p=97" rel="nofollow">Is Trail of Cthulhu Broken, or Is It Just Me?</a>. I talk about my experiences running TOC, good and bad, and back it up with some entertaining (and brief) AP excerpts, which focus on the character of Irving Thalberg, Hollywood boy wonder producer, as played by Mel White in one game and Lowell Carson in another. I hope you'll listen and find it interesting; the whole episode clocks in at just under 24 minutes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209045/#Comment_209045" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T04:12:54+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  4:12AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2009 4:14AM by Graham.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How fascinating. Thanks, Bill. I love the Actual Play recordings.<br/><br/>You're totally right, I think, that Trail Of Cthulhu is an example of Design What Doesn't Matter. It gets the investigation mechanics out of the way, so you can concentrate on how your character reacts to the horror. What matters isn't the mystery, per se, as what it does to you.<br/><br/>You mention a problem which I don't think is a problem: that the mechanics don't completely get out of the way. Of course, there's a moment when you say "I spend a point of Reassurance", but I've never found that breaks the mood. It breaks the mood much less than rolling for Reassurance, failing and then rolling again. <br/><br/>But if that <i>does</i> break the mood, there are things you can do: I'm fascinated by your idea of Key Phrases. You could absolutely say that, for example, when someone says "I put my arm round her. I'm trying to Reassure her." that that's a cue for Reassurance being used. Perhaps it could be accompanied by a hand gesture, just to make it clear.<br/><br/>I don't know much about the Magic system, but I <i>do</i> know that you absolutely shouldn't be rolling for something, again and again, trying to get a success. And the player narrated every failure, too! Painful to listen to.<br/><br/>I'm fascinated by your style of being a Keeper. You mention it's centred on the players, and perhaps it is, but to me, it seemed very Keeper-centric. For example, you started one scene by basically saying:<br/><br/><b>You see</b> Greta Garbo in her room and<br/><b>You notice</b> a crystal dodecahedron on her shelf and<br/><b>A two-point Reassurance spend</b> will get you some information.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd have sat back and let the players find that stuff out.<br/><br/>You also, I think, set stakes for various rolls, and told the players what their characters wanted out of the conflict. That was interesting. I personally wouldn't use stakes in Trail of Cthulhu, but it was interesting to hear how they might be used.<br/><br/>Really interesting stuff. Thank you. I will record one of my sessions soon and let you criticize me back.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209067/#Comment_209067" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T07:50:06+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  7:50AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Graham -- One of the things that I like about doing this podcast is the extent to which I learn about my own GMing style and how to fix it, in the sense of bringing it more in line with what I believe is good play. The title of the episode was not a rhetorical question: it is entirely possible that the thing that's broken is me -- or, more precisely, that what is revealed is the circumstances under which I break down as GM. Mel has gotten entire episodes out of such moments of disconnect between what I say I believe about GMing and what I actually do.<br/><br/>So this episode is about me grappling with TOC. When you say:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>You also, I think, set stakes for various rolls, and told the players what their characters wanted out of the conflict. That was interesting. I personally wouldn't use stakes in Trail of Cthulhu, but it was interesting to hear how they might be used.</blockquote>\nI think what you're talking about is the first excerpt, where Irving Thalberg (famous Hollywood producer) and Dorothea Lange (then-obscure but now well-known photographer of the Depression in the U.S.) are in a hobo jungle, independently, filming what's going on there in order to either prove that the poor were shiftless ne'er-do-wells or that they retained some essentially human quality of dignity, respectively. That set-up was part of the opening scene of the scenario the first time I ran it, intended to get the action going with the characters all in one spot -- essentially how I'd run SOTC. As I said in the episode, that was a mistake. TOC doesn't want to run like that, and the scenario doesn't open with that scene any more.<br/><br/>The scene with the magic is actually more subtle than it first appears. On the surface, my mistake is in dragging out the magic rolls by letting Irving retry (because I want so badly for his effort to pay off). When you listen more closely to what Lowell is saying, though, it turns out that he's <i>fine</i> with failing; he's doing what he's doing not to be effective in his efforts to use magic to defend against the Mythos, but in order to wave a big red flag at Nyarlathotep saying "Come and get me!" And I wasn't clever enough to pick up on that in the moment.<br/><br/>As for the scene with Greta, I'm willing to cop to rushing things to get to the climax, given that the 4-hour slot we were in was rapidly nearing its end. But to a certain degree, I could argue that I was merely trying to implement TOC's design philosophy: if there's something there, give it to the players. Why make them pixel-bitch? On the other hand, the ham-handed intrusiveness of "Pay 2 Reassurance and I'll give you more" doesn't strike anyone as good form, I don't think. It occurs to me that one could let the action go until the end of a scene and then levy Investigation points from the investigators: "In that scene, you got extra info from the cop, so give me one Cop Talk."<br/><br/>In any event, it is all very interesting stuff. I look forward to hearing your AP. I hope you'll give us permission to extract excerpts for a future episode of Virtual Play.<br/><br/>-- Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209083/#Comment_209083" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T09:16:43+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  9:16AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for this episode, Bill. While it's true I was in the first, imperfect run of the adventure, I don't think this show has mollified my concerns about the system. I really dislike the central conceit, the "cool thing" about the rules, which is that you can spend points to avoid interacting with the system. I love interacting with the system. Married to that is the fact that it seems that the game has to have a thoroughly pre-planned plot, so that all player choice is meaningless. Is there any way in which this game does not require railroading and illusionism (or participationism) that I'm missing/wasn't present in the podcast?<br/><br/>I found playing the game very frustrating, and the only enjoyment I got was a few moments of character embodiment (my own, and others'). I really think this isn't the game for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209088/#Comment_209088" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T09:42:27+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  9:42AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2009 9:47AM by Graham.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds right, Rob, it isn't the game for you.<br/><br/>Trail of Cthulhu, in my opinion, gets unfairly branded as illusionistic/railroading. Of course, there's a sense in which the investigation is railroaded: you progress through a known sequence of scenes. But that's not the point*. The investigation isn't the story. The story is what happens to your character: and, in that, you have <i>all kinds</i> of choice. In that sense, it's no more illusionistic than, say, Grey Ranks.<br/><br/>I don't quite understand the bit about spending points to avoid interacting with the system.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I have written a Trail of Cthulhu scenario and, hence, get money from peddling my dysfunctional illusionistic wares.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>* Imagine this entire post is said in a nice tone of voice, so that I'm saying "I don't think that's the point", rather than "You're missing the point, moron!".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209105/#Comment_209105" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T11:21:04+00:00" title="May 26, 2009 11:21AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob -- Let me say up front that I'm working on the sound quality. Expect much better next episode.<br/><br/>The degree to which TOC can be "story-gamed up" is a little bit at stake, pace Graham, so it's worth talking about. I had some good success in the second run tying Cthulhu Mythos skill spends to player-authoring of the fiction in terms of the secret-historical aspects of the game. But I think it's important that the GM's first instinct should be to call for a Stability test when a character is in a bind, rather than let the player narrate themselves out -- and I don't mean that in a Czege principle violation sort of way, but rather in a thinking-outside-the-box sort of way (which does and should work in SOTC). <br/><br/>That said, the difficulty I noticed is the extent to which my understanding of the Mythos as very bleak makes me feel an obligation to confound optimistic player efforts to do something clever that I would reward in a different game. So when you had Upton Sinclair dream his way to the throne of Azathoth, I wasn't sure how to handle it, so it fizzled. Ironically, Lowell Carson would have been amenable to much more soul-crushing than I was in fact able to bring myself to inflict.<br/><br/>So I'm not sure I can assuage your concerns. I think TOC is and should be a high-prep game. I think the mechanics may be "over-optimized" for investigation type stories in a way that makes it hard to run this particular story, where PCs may find themselves also dealing with and participating in political skulduggery, but I can live with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209114/#Comment_209114" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T11:54:18+00:00" title="May 26, 2009 11:54AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh... how is spending points avoiding contact with the system, Rob? Can you expand on that?<br/><br/>Spending points(*) kinda <i>is</i> the system. What you are avoiding is the chance of failure where it makes no sense. In a way, you "say yes" because <i>acquiring</i> the clues is not the point; the point is interpreting those clues, and experiencing the mystery.<br/><br/>(*) Also, in 90% of the cases you shouldn't spend a point: you simply get the clue. Spending is for extra info that helps connecting the dots. (but I guess this is tangential and not the point)<br/><br/><i>Disclaimer: I am too a kinda interested party since I and my buddies publish the gumshoe stuff in Italy, and I'm mostly talking from an Esoterrorists POV, since I don't know ToC in detail (the cthulhu stuff is out of our domain).</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209137/#Comment_209137" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T14:18:59+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  2:18PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2009 2:19PM by Simon_Rogers.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Married to that is the fact that it seems that the game has to have a thoroughly pre-planned plot, so that all player choice is meaningless.</blockquote>\nFirst, the game does not have to have a thoroughly pre-planned plot, and second, having a pre-planned set of scenes does not make player choice meaningless. Why do you think it does?<br/><br/>I'll address the first objection. GUMSHOE allows you to create pre-planned adventures, and makes it likely that if you do, they won't bog down.  It's no more or less rail-roading to offer a point spend as it is a die roll.  It does not prevent players going off in their own directions (certainly not in playtesting, nor in any game I've run or played in). It can also be used explicitly for improvisation. The important thing is to incorporate player suggestions for skill use. We'll be releasing a Trail of Cthulhu supplement called The Armitage Files which does exactly that.<br/><br/>As for the spell failure in the actual play - if you needed it to work for the game to continue, then the consequence of failed rolls should not be a failed spell, but damaged Stability or Health. This is covered under general rolls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209157/#Comment_209157" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T16:13:23+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  4:13PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, clearly I did it wrong.

Going mad is superb fun, so I give them the Stability check sheet and tell them to call for a check whenever they want one. First one to go mad gets a prize: I don't say that, but I like to imply it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Interpersonal Skills, in my opinion, should be seen as roleplay tools. Rather than this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Player: I spend a point of Reassurance.<br/>\nKeeper: OK, cool. Here's what she tells you...</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Player: I spend a point of Reassurance.<br/>\nKeeper: Go on, reassure me.

So it was in fact part of investigating or at least confronting the mind-numbing horror. <br/><br/>"I, Governor" (the name of the adventure) is an atypical Trail of Cthulhu adventure because it takes place against a backdrop of campaign intrigue and political skulduggery, with characters "ripped from history." I think I have the at-start figured out now; it's a version of what the TOC book calls "the hook" (weirdness gets displayed) but in a somewhat more oblique way.

He wants to <i> engage with the system</i>, not get the system out of the way. I understand that preference; I'd argue that it's central to "Forge-inspired design," where the whole point of mechanics is to reinforce and reward particular behaviors (generally, thematically appropriate ones). That gets back to one of the points I was trying to make: TOC doesn't work like that, exactly. Dave Berg can tell you about his conversation with Ron Edwards about TOC's reward cycle, in which losing sanity is connected to learning cosmic truths, but there's a game-mechanical lacuna between those two parts that has to be bridged with role-playing.  Which means it won't necessarily be bridged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209510/#Comment_209510" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T04:13:59+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  4:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally. The mechanics get out of the way, largely, and if you don't like mechanics that do that, you won't like Trail of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Importantly, though, the <i>system</i>, in the Forge-style sense of "Everything that goes on around the table", <i>doesn't</i> get out of the way. The system of Trail of Cthulhu is largely separate from the mechanics: it's about how the Keeper reveals the mystery; how the Investigators interact with each other and the weirdness; and how everyone goes slightly mad.<br/><br/>Everyone knows how to play Cthulhu and it doesn't particularly involve mechanics. You could <i>easily</i> play a Cthulhu game without mechanics. So what the Trail of Cthulhu mechanics do is get out of the way and let you play that Cthulhu game. That's the system you engage with: the "Cthulhu-playing" system encapsulated in social mechanics, not the written rules.<br/><br/>(Is one way of seeing it).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209511/#Comment_209511" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T05:07:44+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  5:07AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

It's a mystery, you, like a viewer of CSI, want to get to end of the mystery and confront (or be confronted by the horror), that's what Cthulhu is all about. With GUMSHOE you will.<br/><br/>It's actually quite a balancing act in games dealing with the needs of plot and actions without one squishing the other. I've found that GUMSHOE does this pretty well. <br/><br/>But for some gamers, this is a false dichotomy. If the game is charater-driven then there is no plot, so how can their be a conflict?<br/><br/>[GUSMHOE can also be played as character-driven, in fact the next supplement will deal with that, but it's not the way most people play]<br/><br/>So I've got the book.

Those are the mechanics that "get out of the way", the Design What Doesn't Matter mechanics.</li>\n<li>Many of the mechanics, like the Stability and Drive mechanics, <i>do</i> add to the fiction. Those are the Design What Matters mechanics.</li>\n<li>There's huge amounts of background material: for example, Ken Hite's take on the Mythos. The nature of the Mythos is a huge part of the Cthulhu <i>system</i>, even though it's not enshrined in the mechanics.</li></ul>\nSo there you go. Stuff like that.
