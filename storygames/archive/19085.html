I'm happy about that project because Ghost is a Drama RPG! <br/><br/>GHOST "THE ROAD TO LIGHT" a drama RPG.<br/>"That night you drank too much; with your car you ran over an innocent boy", your actions has broken a life and ruined a family. After your death, you've found a last chance to reedem yourself: to bring together a broken family, one that has suffered the same kind of tragedy you caused.<br/><br/>Explore the emotional bonds that tie the living and the dead in this story role-playing game.  Is despair and sadness too painful to overcome, or will happy endings be in the horizon before the curtain closes?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I know that the theme of this RPG is very "strong", but I think it's a good game to explore with your friends "critical situations" and together find "the road to light".  I was skeptical about this genre of games, then a new friend Giacomo Vicenzi give me the opportunity to try his Burning Opera and this game has destroyed my prejudice! Than I've also played and loved "Hot Guys Making Out" of Ben Lehman, it was further convinced of how valuable these games can be!<br/><br/><b>Read more about the game:</b><br/><a href="http://quanteidee.blogspot.it/2013/12/lets-talk-about-ghost-road-to-light.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://quanteidee.blogspot.it/2013/12/lets-talk-about-ghost-road-to-light.html</a><br/><br/><b>Or give us a Coffee:</b><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/121080/Ghost-%22The-road-to-light%22?term=Ghost+%5C%22The+road+to+" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/121080/Ghost-"The-road-to-light"?term=Ghost+\\"The+road+to+</a><br/><br/>Greatings from italy!<br/>Giovanni                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
