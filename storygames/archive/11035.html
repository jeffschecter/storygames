If I were doing a sci-fi in this bent, and especially if these aliens took on the psychological profiles of the animals they resemble, I'd do it like 'Albedo' and make it a full-on Anthro RPG. No aliens, no humans, just anthropomorphic critters.<br/><br/>But that's the thing about anthropomorphisation; the animals likely don't have the qualities we perceive in them, or even any concept of what those qualities mean. We project human values onto dumb animals, that's what anthropomorphisation means.<br/><br/>Not being a fan of this type of alien, I can't really think of any successful examples. Unlike Graham, I found the Mass Effect aliens extremely stereotypical of the genre, but that may be because the game spent way too much time explaining itself when it should have been demonstrating by example. I always had a soft spot for Iron Claw and Jade Claw, but they're not sci-fi. Albedo I already mentioned, but I've never been able to get my hands on a copy to read it, so I can't say if it's good or not.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244790/#Comment_244790" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T05:35:04+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  5:35AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Traveller has some good dog people, the Vargr, especially as depicted in the scenario, <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_2696.html" rel="nofollow">Space Dogs</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244806/#Comment_244806" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T06:07:21+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  6:07AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Wolves are fascinating.

I always thought the Kzinti were pretty well done, as a feline analog (note: they ain't "Earth tigers with language and tech"). Have you read all the <i>Man-Kzin Wars</i> books? Authors other than Niven do better with them (the <i>Ringworld</i> Kzin are more like you're saying).<br/><br/>Other than that... I got nuthin'. It's a rare author that can actually accomplish what you seem to expect, Elliott. Most authors can't even write about *human* world views and behaviors other than those of their gender and socio-economic, ethnic, and educational background. To have to step beyond those mental bounds AND extrapolate how an animal (a) thinks now and thus (b) will think when sapient... well, let us know who pulls it off and we'll go read the next Nebula Award winner. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>There's also a practical element--one might call it "You Can't Write About Aliens"--in that most fiction tries to actually be of some utility (cathartic or otherwise) to humans, not to animals. So I'd argue that the pinnacle of success at what you seek... would mean little or nothing to you. It might be fascinating (much like some of the weirder LOLcat images that come to my RSS feed) but it won't resonate or provide utility to your human mind... unless it's so anthropomorphic that it succumbs to the "faults" you outline in your OP.<br/><br/>That's my theory, anyway. It's kind of like Ashok says: a "real dogman" story would be all about fascination with anal scents and musk, and constant domination and submission exchanges (I mean CONSTANT, if we talk a large population--go to a dog park some time!). It would bore humans to tears, if it didn't disgust them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244836/#Comment_244836" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T08:56:42+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  8:56AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Three thumbs up to John--those are all great (anthro) examples.

For example, I'd be very surprised if aliens that swim in a liquid don't look like some sort of fish. <br/><br/>This also goes for behaviour - there are likely to be a lot of common niches that lead to common ways of life. So I think it's wrong to just discount fiction where the aliens are like terrestrial creatures. It's important to think about why they are like that.<br/><br/>All this goes by the by if you start looking at life based on wholly different types of biochemistry, I suppose - who knows what might be important then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

As a skeptic, I have to admit it is more likely my memory is at fault.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245460/#Comment_245460" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T01:35:50+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  1:35AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite>It is not that the alien is a "dog-person".

Which is to say that it only goes so far, and then the alienness comes back in.  So any divergences between how a dog alien acts and a real doge acts is a manifestation of the fact that the alien in no way shares a biological history with the dog, and shouldn't cause any problems for suspension of disbelief.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245593/#Comment_245593" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T14:54:10+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  2:54PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, it wouldn't.

These are worth bonus points for the massive array of wickedly cool aliens of all type and description on display, especially the Jophur, creatures composed of stacked tori of living <i>wax</i>.<br/><br/>The Image comic book series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantmen" rel="nofollow">Elephantmen</a> works the tried-and-true 'we evolved them to fight for us' model of animal sapience pretty entertainingly, as do S. Andrew Swann's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreau_Series" rel="nofollow">Moreau</a> hard-boiled cyberpunk novels.<br/><br/>Phillip Jose Farmer, writing as Kurt Vonnegut's fictional SF author Kilgore Trout, wrote a gonzo SF masterpiece called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_on_the_Half-Shell" rel="nofollow">Venus on the Half-Shell</a>, where he postulated a far-future society of evolved cats that had the conversation-stopping detail of large buckets of water outside hotels and apartment buildings where the highly  promiscuous and exceedingly fertile adult felines could easily and conveniently drown all those unwanted kittens that were the result of their sexual revolution.<br/><br/>FInally, for something much more low-key and story game-like, I can't recommend Terry Bisson's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning short story <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bears_Discover_Fire" rel="nofollow">Bears Discover Fire</a> highly enough. The plot is hat bears learn how to use fire and start building campfires on highway medians in the Southern US. That's really all that happens, but the nuance and musings on community, sentience, communication, and what 'wilderness' means are sublime.<br/><br/>As to gaming, I have real trouble playing something that's completely alien. I am much more enamored of the whole 'Uplift' conception; sentient EARTH animals are easiest for us to have a sense of their general disposition and drives and to extrapolate that to what sort of intelligence they'd likely have, and which of US they'd look to for examples of how to behave and start to deal with things like recorded memory and leisure time. <br/><br/>It's the age-old 'other dilemma': we want our aliens to be cool and odd and different, but not so much that they'd have no interest in, or worse, capability of, interacting with us.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245827/#Comment_245827" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T15:12:39+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  3:12PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite><br/>Phillip Jose Farmer, writing as Kurt Vonnegut's fictional SF author Kilgore Trout, wrote a gonzo SF masterpiece called<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_on_the_Half-Shell" rel="nofollow">Venus on the Half-Shell</a>, where he postulated a far-future society of evolved cats that had the conversation-stopping detail of large buckets of water outside hotels and apartment buildings where the highly  promiscuous and exceedingly fertile adult felines could easily and conveniently drown all those unwanted kittens that were the result of their sexual revolution.</blockquote>\nWasn't that the book with the sapient dog aliens who could only be distinguished from each other by smelling their anuses?
