But, let's say you had more time to think about it. <br/><br/>Looking at the things that already exist in the game, I know that I need to tweak the Keys and Secrets and probably redefine the Pools. I also could get a lot of fun out of defining new Species and Cultures.<br/><br/>So, ignoring any new rules at this time, what comes to your mind?<br/><br/>I'll start with some stuff off the top of my head.<br/><br/>Cultures: Hoffman Institute (Think Tank/Research Group), Department 13 (Government Agency), MUFON (Underground Organization), Rosencreutz (Conspiracy)<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Hmm, based on just that, I'd think that characters would start with at least one or two cultures and add them as they went along ...<br/><br/>Species: Human, A.H. (Advanced Human), Alien Servitor<br/><br/>Pools: Shadow (Danger?) (Abilities based on getting into and out of danger), Conspire (Abilities based on conspiring and maintaining conspiracies), Abyss (Abilities based on learning the truth and anything supernatural or alien in origin)<br/><br/>Ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101670/#Comment_101670" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T11:19:05+00:00" title="October  8, 2007 11:19AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mark.<br/><br/>Building factions as 'cultures' rather suggests you can't meaningfully change faction. That's interesting, and gives a lot of weight to the factions. It's more than just changing jobs. So presumably they would then have secrets like a government agency's Secret of the Badge and Secret of Backup.<br/><br/>Your pools look really interesting. Taking Clinton's advice that pools are what defines a person in your game, I think they're excellent. They set the characters aside from the sheep (who don't get into danger, don't conspire, don't seek the truth). You also end up with nifty ability groups. <br/><br/>How about pool refreshes? Refresh Conspire with clandestine meetings?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101677/#Comment_101677" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T12:17:25+00:00" title="October  8, 2007 12:17PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah yes, the flip side of the Pools. I'd imagine that Refreshes would be described as "What do you do to keep your humanity?" and used as valves on the tense conspiracy action game you'd be creating.<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, I'd think:<br/><br/>Shadow/Danger - Share a moment of peace with someone.<br/>Conspire - Enjoy a spontaneous act with someone.<br/>Abyss -  Step back from the Abyss and become intimate with someone.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? What it really does is make you make others vulnerable to the conspiracies and supernatural beasties you come in contact with. Eventually, you might choose to not bring anyone into danger - and you'd become powerless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101698/#Comment_101698" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T13:56:46+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  1:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're really good refreshes.

Like you say, the refreshes are where characters would connect with others, build relationships, and develop those pesky dependant NPCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101715/#Comment_101715" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T15:20:54+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  3:20PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the cultures were related to how you deal with the conspiracy?<br/><br/>Paranoids would be those people who are convinced "The Truth is out There". They can see and beleive things others can't and excel at working at the grassroots and undergound level.<br/><br/>Agents would be people who touch the conspiracy in the context of their work: agents of the government, law enforcement, and so on. They'd have resources to bring to bear.<br/><br/>Initiates would be people who are on the "inside". If not actualy members of the conspiracy, they're nevertheless aware of the magic/weirdness/history/secrets/facts that the uninitated don't know.<br/><br/>Normals are people who are blissfuly unaware of the conspiracy or think it's an empty sham. Their moral purity makes them strong.<br/><br/>Users are people who see the conspiracy as something to be used and conquored. This culture may include those behind the conspiracy.<br/><br/>Players start out with no known culture. Cultures have cool secrest. Cultures also have cool versions of existing secrets. When you join a culture, your exisitng secrets get powered up.<br/><br/>Players can switch cultures, but they get a secret that means they're hunted, cursed, or some other bad thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101806/#Comment_101806" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T03:52:04+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  3:52AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>What if the cultures were related to how you deal with the conspiracy?</blockquote>\nExactly what I was going for.

You now have a contra-Pool for Abyss called Shadow. It will act as a cap for Abyss in that your total Abyss Pool points + your total Shadow Pool points can never exceed 10. You start with 1 Pool Point. Shadow Pool points act as bonus dice for Abyss (or Shadow) Abilities and can be used in conjunction with Abyss Pool points (only for Abyss Abilities).<br/><br/>Shadow - Abilities based on the maddening power of the Abyss<br/>Refreshes by: Inducting someone into the world of the supernatural<br/><br/>Key of the Shadow\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Grip<br/>Prerequisite: Secret of the Shadow of the Abyss<br/>The Shadow drives you and distracts you from others around you. Gain 1 XP whenever you use a Shadow Ability in front of someone you weren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t supposed to. Gain 2 XP if doing so brings about undesirable consequences. Gain 5 XP if doing so brings about grave consequences. Buyoff: Remove your Shadow Pool by taking as much Harm as the Pool has (total) points. If you have more points than Harm, you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll have to do it stages.<br/><br/>Ability - Revelation<br/>You can cause yourself or others to see the real universe, if but for a moment. This can be used to gain insight into a mystery, distract someone from their immediate goal, or lead a crowd to a cultish frenzy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
