And yet, that's not stopping me from trying!  I'm building an attachment to an existing game, and I'm looking for the "astrological/philosophical" components to the four elements ("Fire represents passion, change, and life!"). I scooted around on the internet, including Wikipedia, but I could only find alchemical meanings of the elements (like ancient Greec sciences, etc).<br/><br/>So, I'm looking for either Your Take, or a weblink to someone else's take, on what the four elements represent. I'm looking for a way to connect them to good and bad things.<br/><br/>Like, Fire frex: If I were to (pull out of my butt and) say "Fire is the element of passion and change!", then of course good things might be creativitiy, love of someone, conviction towards something. But it also might be an unhealthy obsession with something, an uncontrolled anger towards something, and the like.<br/><br/>Give me some pointers!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135432/#Comment_135432" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T14:52:50+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  2:52PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were to associate them with stats (and what's more of a philosophical division of the universe than stats?), I would use...<br/><br/>Fire: Insight<br/>Earth: Resolve<br/>Water: Might<br/>Air: Grace<br/><br/>Or... if you want to be more fancy about it, arranging the 4 in a circle, each stat is the sum of 2 elements:<br/><br/>Fire+Earth: Resolve<br/>Earth+Water: Might<br/>Water+Air: Grace<br/>Air+Fire: Insight                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135433/#Comment_135433" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T14:53:26+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  2:53PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The tarot suits have a clueful mapping of the elements.<br/><br/>Examples of the elements, in action:<br/>- Thrice's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemy_Index_Vols._I_&amp;_II" rel="nofollow">Alchemy Index</a> anthology<br/>- Cowboy Bebop (figure it out for yourself)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135434/#Comment_135434" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T14:54:39+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  2:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look up the four humors.

Represented by the Grace Brannagh, a no-nonsense, sword-and-sorcery pulp era Promethea.</li><li><b>Cups/Water:</b> Compassion / Emotions. Represented by Margaret Taylor Case, the Promethea that made an appearance in WWI, and was described as an "angel of mercy" to the soldiers during that period.</li><li><b>Pentacles/Earth:</b> Material Existence / Awareness. Represented by William Woolcott, the only guy in the series that manifested Promethea. Was a very silly Promethea, who reveled in the physical world, but who got killed for his/her troubles.</li><li><b>Wands/Fire:</b> Inner will / creativity. Represented by Barbara Shelley. Initially a Promethea powered by her husband's imagination and creativity; but once her husband died, she substituted her husband's creativity with her sheer damn stubbornness and willpower. Didn't work out very well, but she manages one last heroic gasp before expiring.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135452/#Comment_135452" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T17:56:02+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  5:56PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take, from my own RPG efforts:<br/><br/>Fire: Energy/Destruction<br/>Water: Empathy/Apathy<br/>Earth: Life/Death<br/>Air: Thought/Madness<br/><br/>To riff off of Ryan, I'll continue with 12 of the total 15 attributes from the same game: <br/><br/>Fire -

I appreciate your help!<br/><br/>I'm going with the Everway thing, tempered with the Four Humors and Tarot.<br/><br/>This is basically for a rules hack for <a href="http://www.robo-christ.com/rpg/l5rsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Legend of the Five RIngs</a>. I've changed the way Honor works, and created this thing called the "Go-Un", or in Eng-Sanskrit "The Five Skandhas", and I'm doing a crossover of the traditional Skandhas and the L5R elements.<br/><br/>They're going to be basically like Spiritual Attributes had a flipper-baby with Keys: Raise them by actions in-game, and then drop them to cash in for skill and attribute raises. I want the players to write in their own SA for each element that relates to that element (Fire might be "I want to be known as the greatest swordsman in the clan"; Water might be "I love Hira-e and will do anything for her"). They raise when you do actions to further them. If you lower any single Skandha by two, you can raise any skill point by one. If you drop a Skandha by 8 points, you can raise an attribute point up one.<br/><br/>That's the thought, anyway. Tomorrow, in play, we'll see how it works.

Note that even while I'm talking about martial arts in here, the basis (the concept of archetypes and their interrelation and effects) could be applied to many more things.<br><br/><b><span style="color: #aa0000;">Fire:</span></b> <i>Fire burns, consumes, extends.</i> Techniques that focus on damaging and disabling the opponent.<br/><i>Offensive:</i> You try to cause as much extended damage as possible with every single strike. You do not concern yourself about your own injuries, since you don't care much about pain. In fact you have learned to loose yourself in battle, following only your instincts. You have learned to disable and injure your rival, so his attacks become less effective. Typical attacks include using your knees, elbows, knuckles, chi attacks...<br/><i>Defensive:</i> You try to block your enemy in a way that every attack weakens and damages him. Hitting you becomes like trying to grab a red-hot coil. You know how to use your own defenses to disable him. Typical defenses include stopping kicks with other kicks or with your elbows, using your opponent's own momentum and strength against himself, using your chi to damage someone grappling you...<br/><br/><b><span style="color: #0000FF;">Water:</span></b> <i>As cold as the peaceful pond, as dangerous as the wild storm.</i> Techniques that focus on reflection, wit and adaptability.<br/><i>Offensive:</i> You try to inflict precise and controlled attacks, gaining strength and speed through momentum. You know when to hit and how, and learn to wait until the very best moment to do so. Typical attacks include counterattacks, hits with your palms and graceful, dance like movements...<br/><i>Defensive:</i> You adapt to your opponent's movement. You move with him, feel like him, think like him. You anticipate his movements and use the best and most efficient approach to defend from him. Typical defenses include defensive throws, circular and precise motions, counter-attack like defenses...<br/><br/><b><span style="color: #996633;">Earth:</span> </b><i>Nothing moves you. Nothing damages you. Nothing distracts you.</i> Techniques that rely on stability, brute force and concentration.<br/><i>Offensive:</i> You try to use all your might in every single attack. Some even say the perfect technique would be the one able to knock out an opponent with a single hit. There is no defense against your attacks; if they don't want to feel the pain, they can only evade your hits. Typical attacks include strong, heavy and direct kicks and punches, headbutts, tackles, slams...<br/><i>Defensive:</i> Your defense is unbreakable, your body seems impervious to pain. Moving you is like moving a mountain. Distracting you is like distracting a statue. You are the paragon of balance, tranquility and might. Typical defenses short, powerful blocks, focused appliances of strength at the right time, and even no defense at all (practitioners of this style learn to deal with the pain and minimize the damage from any attack)...<br/><br/><b><span style="color: #66dddd;">Air:</span></b> <i>You cannot hit what is not there.</i> Techniques based on movement, flexibility and speed. Masters of aerial combat.<br/><i>Offensive:</i> You have learned that strong attacks mean nothing if they are unable to land. Thus you focus on hitting your enemy as much and as many times as you can. You tire him, you waste him, you defeat him. Speed is the key, confusion and frustration your allies. Typical attacks include quick and short attacks, swift precise touches, surprise throws and staves, flying kicks...<br/><i>Defensive:</i> Your best defense is to never get hit. You have maximized your speed and agility, and with lightning reflexes you are able to avoid practically all attacks. Stay away from your opponent's reach, since your speed would allow you to get him in your own and get away again before he can react. Typical defenses include last second dodges, quick jumps, bouncing on the arena, staying out of your enemy's reach...<br/><br/>Note that, as with any archetypal system, they are not absolute extremes. One warrior can develop a balanced style using the best parts of every system, or he can complement the weaknesses of his own technique with some knowledge of the opposite one. One can even switch from one style to another one in the middle of the battle.<br/><br/>And remember. We are talking about Far East philosophies. Ying-yang. The True Master knows it is better to complement his training with different disciplines, and that only the fool focus completely on one single, vulnerable technique. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses, and it is best to study each one with care.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135586/#Comment_135586" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T15:46:26+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  3:46PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2008 3:47PM by jason.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<table border="1">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>System</th>\n<th>Air</th>\n<th>Fire</th>\n<th>Earth</th>\n<th>Water</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tfoot>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6">Mostly from "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_humours" rel="nofollow">Humorism</a>" on Wikipedia</td>\n</tr>\n</tfoot>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>Seasons</td>\n<td>Spring</td>\n<td>Autumn</td>\n<td>Summer</td>\n<td>Winter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan="2">c. 400 BCE</td>\n<td>Hippocrates' four humors</td>\n<td>Blood</td>\n<td>Black Bile</td>\n<td>Yellow Bile</td>\n<td>Phlegm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Characteristics</td>\n<td>Courageous, amorous</td>\n<td>Despondent, sleepless</td>\n<td>Easily angered</td>\n<td>Calm, unemotional</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan="2">c. 325 BCE</td>\n<td>Aristotle's four elements</td>\n<td>Air</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n<td>Earth</td>\n<td>Water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aristotle's four sources of happiness</td>\n<td><em>Hedone</em> (Sensuous pleasure)</td>\n<td><em>Propraitari</em> (Acquiring assets)</td>\n<td><em>Ethikos</em> (Moral virtue)</td>\n<td><em>Dialogike</em> (Logical investigation)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>c. 190</td>\n<td>Galens four temperaments</td>\n<td>Sanguine</td>\n<td>Melancholic</td>\n<td>Choleric</td>\n<td>Phlegmatic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>c. 1550</td>\n<td>Paracelsus' four totem spirits</td>\n<td>Changeable Salamanders</td>\n<td>Industrious Gnomes</td>\n<td>Inspired Nymphs</td>\n<td>Curious Sylphs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1905</td>\n<td>Adicke's four world views</td>\n<td>Innovative</td>\n<td>Traditional</td>\n<td>Doctrinaire</td>\n<td>Skeptical</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1914</td>\n<td>Spr\xe4nger's four value attitudes</td>\n<td>Artistic</td>\n<td>Economic</td>\n<td>Religious</td>\n<td>Theoretical</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1920</td>\n<td>Kretchmer's four character styles</td>\n<td>Hypomanic</td>\n<td>Depressive</td>\n<td>Hyperaesthetic</td>\n<td>Anaesthetic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1947</td>\n<td>Erich Fromm's four orientations</td>\n<td>Exploitative</td>\n<td>Hoarding</td>\n<td>Receptive</td>\n<td>Marketing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1958</td>\n<td>Myers's cognitive types</td>\n<td>SP</td>\n<td>SJ</td>\n<td>NF</td>\n<td>NT</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1978</td>\n<td>Kiersey's four temperaments</td>\n<td>Artisan</td>\n<td>Guardian</td>\n<td>Idealist</td>\n<td>Rational</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nTristan--if you use "Far East philosophies," why do you use the four Aristotelean elements, instead of the five Taoist elements (wood, fire, earth, metal and water)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135600/#Comment_135600" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T19:49:41+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  7:49PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, they're the classic Buddhist elements too, and were used that way (plus Void) in Japan. So it depends on which "Far East" you're talking about, really.<br/><br/>On that matter, I actually had a half-baked fantasy game lurking in my head a while ago that took plance in an Exalted/Avatar-esque land ruled by elemental influences, all about a bitter and vicious war between the forces of Air and Void versus Metal and Wood, with Earth, Fire, and Water caught in the middle. The idea seems too obvious to not have already been done by somebody, though. One of the things I did find interesting is that the Buddhist elements are seen as a hierarchy, as opposed to the Taoist elementals which are seen as a cycle, which is something nice and meaty to make said war "about", at least in my opinion.

Sue me! It is my system. Hehehe! You see, I consider this elements more like archetypes and complements than as a natural process.<br/><br/>Oriental thinking sees their elements as the different states matter can be at. You are in one element, then you evolve into another one. So you can't be in more than one stage at the time, since essencially eventually you could be in all of them.<br/><br/>At the same time, with my view of the Four Western elements, they are not so much a process as different qualities of the same matter. So you can be in a stage where you have all four elements at the same time (although normally you'd have one or two dominant ones).<br/><br/>Another interesting fact I have noticed is the inconsistency of the Fifth Element. For the Greeks it was Ether (light). For the Japanese it was Void (nothingness). For the Chinese it was Metal (I still believe metal could be considered a form of Earth)...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135671/#Comment_135671" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T09:23:13+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  9:23AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2008 9:25AM by jason.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Benhimself -- Well, the Aristotelean elements pop up in a lot of later incarnations and systems too, all the way to modern Wicca, but you can generally trace a line of cultural diffusion.  I don't know for sure, but I think the five elements started with Taoism, and then diffused into Buddhism when Buddhism entered China.  Naturally, they spread throughout the region (with variation, just like Aristotle's system) over time.<br/><br/>Tristan -- I don't know if I agree with your characterization; certainly Taoist medicine emphasizes the idea of balancing the five elements in one's self.  Sickness comes from an excess or lack of one element or another.

It's working this far, we had a session with the new rules and in fact used every single new rule, and there were no problems (yet).<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5878&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5878&amp;page=1</a><br/><br/>In short, here's what I did:<br/>I made up these five elements called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha" rel="nofollow">Skandhas</a>, which couple to each L5R element.<br/><br/>In the Skandha space, the players have to write down a goal, motivation, emotion, etc of their character. "Discover Hashizume Hiroko's secrets"; "My Mentor Over My Lord"; "Avoid my Father's Fate"; "The Hida will Respect me, the Kuni will Fear me", etc. At least 3 skandhas must be written (you can leave some blank for now), but you can write all five if you want.<br/><br/>The part I wanted help with was deciding how to force players to write a motivation based in "Water", or a Skandha that reflects "Void" or "Fire". <br/><br/>What I ended up settling on was making it SIMPLY A SUGGESTION to tie these "Un" or "Skandha" to one of the five Real Skandhas, or else make them like the element they relate to. Use the element's meaning as a ladder, not a box to shoehorn yourself into. The players were actually creating skandhas where, if you squint right, yeah it seems to relate to the paired element. It's worked out really well!<br/><br/>How they work (simple terms) They serve as containers for Fan Mail. When a player gets fan mail, they drop the coin (when they feel like) back to the center of the table, and fill in one of their skandhas. The best thing to do is to fill in the skandha that closest relates to what they were awarded for. But it really doesn't matter. You can also get bonus dice to a roll with them.<br/><br/>Later, Skandhas can be drained to gain skill and attribute raises.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone for your suggestions, it helped!<br/><br/>(see the thread linked above for the juicy rule mechanics details)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
