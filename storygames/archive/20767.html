About Braunsteins and trying to hack out more freeform-y, less wargame-y variations.<br/><br/>Grand!<br/><br/>Now I'd like your brainpower for a bit, in coming up with story starters, bits of plot ideas, motivations, and so on for a playset/universe/ toy collection I've been putting together.<br/><br/>Assume that rules-wise/mechanic-wise I have access to either something like Archipelago ( or a variation) or Mythic GM Emulator, or some other high participant input, not-very-phys-sim thingie as the engine. Or that I can throw something together.<br/><br/>What does the physical toy collection consist of?<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Innsmouth:</span><br/> Just assume I have enough ( or can rapidly build enough) terrain to cover a 5' x 6' table, either 2D ( using <a href="http://www.wargamevault.com/browse.php?keywords=heroic+maps+wardenhale&amp;author=&amp;artist=&amp;pfrom=&amp;pto=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">Heroic Map's Wardenhale collection</a> or 3D ( using <a href="http://www.wargamevault.com/browse/pub/4244/Stoelzels-Structures" rel="nofollow">Stoelzels' Structures)</a>, along with the usual combo of junk minis gamers tend to have around the house.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The People in your Neighbrhood:</span><br/>The Hybrids from the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/643047657/the-secret-of-innsmouth-act-two-the-return" rel="nofollow">Blind Beggar miniatures Secret of Innsmouth Act 2 KS </a> that just ended, plus some Deep Ones and Hybrids from other companies, like RAFM.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Junk:</span> <br/>Various cars and boats are available, plus civilians from periods form the 1920s to present. Heck, there are even some <a href="http://www.hfminis.co.uk/shop?product=gang-%26-dog-%285%29---%28pre%252dorder%29~hfn016&amp;category=modern-%26%0D%0Apost%252dapoc~modern-non%252dcoms-%2F-civilians" rel="nofollow">Meddling Kids and their Great Dane</a>, in a hippy van, available if need be.<br/><br/>And, naturally, various bigger Cthulhoid nasties are available as well.<br/><br/><b>I will be trying to stay away from gun-bunnies and soldier-y types, by preference.</b><br/>Gangsters and investigators are okay...maybe. The focus is supposed to be on the Deep Ones though.<br/><br/>So that's the physical stuff I have to work with.<br/><br/>What I want from you kind folks is the fiction stuff that ties it all together and creates set ups and possible events to use with that stuff.<br/><br/>Assume it's a small group playgroup of 2-5 players, but that mechanics are not character monogamous at all.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoctimaniaGames" title="NoctimaniaGames"><img alt="NoctimaniaGames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoctimaniaGames">NoctimaniaGames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458667/#Comment_458667" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-11T19:31:03+00:00" title="December 11, 2016  7:31PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well what I found most gripping about the Innsmouth story was  the intrigue of the town and its denizens, so I would suggest maybe having 1 player work out some scenes and backstory with the citizens, and then introduce the more human like characters thrown into this alien world.<br/><br/>I always find it helpful to write a list of 3-5 conflicts that will happen in the story, with an escalation timeline and associated cast for each.<br/><br/>For instance, a bride gets cold feet - winds up at Innsmouth, the groom comes looking for her. Theres one conflict. It's easier to build a story game around conflicts or goals than it is pre-sketched events. <br/><br/>Another cool thing you could do is flip some of the themes of the original story on their heads. Lovecraft had a very xenophobic vibe, but what if the story with the deep ones was about the fear the citizens had of humans from the outside world - humans are the real monsters yada yada yada, and they're trying to preserve the town<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458679/#Comment_458679" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-12T12:33:23+00:00" title="December 12, 2016 12:33PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are exactly the sorts of ideas I was hoping for.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'd flip a lot of the original story on its head, or at least play around with the concept a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
