The suggestion came up about running an adventure of Danger Patrol. I had run a few games of it two months back, and the guys who played had been spreading the word about it's ultimate coolness...so, sure enough, everyone decided to hop on the Danger Patrol bandwagon...all TEN people!<br/><br/>So, before I have to steel myself for the onslaught of dealing with so many people again, I figured now would be a good time for me to ask for some advice from other story gamers about how to run Danger Patrol more effectively (or to help clarify for me some of the bits that escaped me originally).<br/><br/>My Concerns:<br/>LARGE GROUP - There'll be at LEAST eight people showing up, which is double what I've run for Danger Patrol before. Am I biting of more than I can chew? I was thinking of requiring everyone to be in pairs for the "Previously On..." segments and the Interludes, grouping one of the experienced players with one of the newbies. Don't know how well this will work, though, especially since most of the group are still hardcore old-school gamers, and aren't used to their ideas being used as adventure fodder.<br/><br/>INTRODUCING NEW THREATS - My one major hiccup from the previous adventures I ran was not knowing if it was okay to introduce new threats on the fly, without it being related to a Threat Move. I would have some of my badguys written on cards kept to the side, and only introduce them as the Threat Move permitted, but the players rarely rolled enough Danger for that to be an issue, and scenes would end rather quickly. Would it be okay, both for fairness and the fiction, to just throw a few more threats into the mix when things seem to be going too easily?<br/><br/>THREAT RESISTANCES - Another problem I had was that some of the major baddies were taken down too easily. I was thinking of having Resistances for any threat of Major level or above (Major would have 1pt of Resistance, Elite would have 2pts of Resistance, etc.) but related to a particular Action. I had an Elite threat on the last adventure, Baron Von Pitt, who was supposed to be a superior pilot, but he was quickly chased down by a non-Flyboy character and defeated. I'm thinking if he had a Resistance 2 against Flyboy, it would require more effort for the characters to chase him down. Good or bad idea?<br/><br/>HEALING/REPAIR IN-SCENE - Anyone have any advice on this? They way I treated this in previous adventures was to have a single Professor or Explorer roll, with a success removing the penalties of injuries/damage (but not the conditions themselves). Is there a better way?<br/><br/>DESCRIBING STAGED THREATS - So, if there is a threat that is kept safe by another threat, should I describe that to the players right from the start? ("Doctor Tang is surrounded by a swarm of his robotic cockroaches, who are protecting him from harm!") Or should I let them find out when the stage threat interferes? ("Your eldritch blast engulfs the evil Doctor Tang, but as the green smoke clears, he remains unscathed, as a few of his robotic cockroaches disintegrate into non-euclidean dust!")<br/><br/>PLAYING SURFACE - Just because the group tends to be more "crunchy" gamers, rather than "chewy" gamers, I'm thinking of making a customized playing surface, a 16"x16" laminated sheet, with 4" grid, to help the players visualize distance and the surroundings. This wouldn't be specific distances, but more to show relative locations of things in relation to each other. For instance, anything within a single square would could be easily interacted with by the player, whereas he would actually have to move about to reach an adjacent square to interact with something there. Anything further would actually require an action roll to traverse the distance in a single round. Good or bad idea?<br/><br/>(Finally) PICKING UP STUFF - Previously, I would allow characters to pick up important clues or items to use them later as a one-shot bonus to a related roll. For instance, one of the characters managed to save the cybernetic disembodied head of Doctor Ben Stein Sigma, professor of archaeology, so I wrote it down on a card and gave it to him as an extra Stuff that he could use on a Professor roll related to archaeology, or something else interesting. Pretty soon, though, I had "crunchy"-minded players trying to pick up random stuff wherever they could to use later, and I had to nix most of their attempts. Should I just not allow them to pick up Stuff except as a later story element, or should I be treating this differently? Also, how do any of you handle Reloads, since we're on the subject of Stuff?<br/><br/>Anyway, sorry for the big post, but I only have six days to prep, and need as much help as I can get!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254484/#Comment_254484" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T10:28:43+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 10:28AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, send someone else the rules and run two games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254487/#Comment_254487" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T10:33:51+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 10:33AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Powell</cite>Um, send someone else the rules and run two games?</blockquote>\nTried that.

My regular group has a slightly rotating membership, but it's almost always at least five people, and often 7-8. It makes for an unwieldy game.<br/><br/>The ideal solution is to figure out a way to game with less players. <br/><br/>But this may not meet your immediate needs.<br/><br/>In general (having never run Danger Patrol), my advice would be this: Big groups work better when the PCs are split up. Even to the point where you are running two parallel games at the same table.  Better to have four people completely out of the scene while the other four are engaged than to have eight people all sort-of-engaged.<br/><br/>Then, if you cut dramatically between the two groups, each group will (maybe) start to get more engaged with the other group's story.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254526/#Comment_254526" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T12:51:49+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 12:51PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite>Better to have four people completely out of the scene while the other four are engaged than to have eight people all sort-of-engaged.<br/><br/>Then, if you cut dramatically between the two groups, each group will (maybe) start to get more engaged with the other group's story.<br/><br/>Good luck!</blockquote>\nThat's actually a really good idea. I'd have to be on the ball about it, and make sure the scenes run smoothly, but that may be a good way to do it. Normally with my friends, splitting the group up is the kiss of death for an adventure...but that's always been for more number-crunchy, combat-takes-friggin'-forever games. That may actually work with Danger Patrol...hmmmmm...<br/>Thanks for the idea!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254547/#Comment_254547" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T13:56:52+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  1:56PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contact one of the newbies and get them to run the concurrent game.<br/><br/>1.)

And the more players you have, the more you have to wait to take your turn.  Additionally, there's no way you can run a battle or other complex conflict in DP for even 6 characters at the same time.  The thing would grind to a slow halt.  Additionally, the kind of opposition you'd have to create (or the players would create for themselves by maxing out danger and creating catastrophes) is gonna make the fight take at least the entire session, if not most of two sessions of play.<br/><br/>The last time I ran Danger Patrol, John printed out a pre-beta draft and we threw down, including character creation.  We had 3 players + me and only one player was unfamiliar with the game.  Still, running creation and the opening conflict took 2 and a half hours.  I think John may be doing some tweaking on his side of things to make sure that doesn't happen regularly, but right now that's how things stand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254595/#Comment_254595" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T16:54:14+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  4:54PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate to splash cold water and would love to offer some help, but I agree strongly with Jonathan.

The only way I was able to make that fly was to split the group into two teams, one fighting a meance in space, the others infiltrating the complex below, so there conflicts were connecetd but not interdependent... and I gave the threats as trophies to the team who defeated them, incentivising quick victory so one team could rush to the aid of (i.e. steal the glory from) the other team.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to not getting enough danger results to bring in more threats: huh? How much danger are they getting on their rolls then? It only takes 3 to add a new threat and I was typically seeing results with 4-8 danger in the second half of the game, so I could have put down a new threat after nearly every roll. Maybe this is a mistake I'm making, but I'd say, if they're plowing through your mooks like a hot knife through butter, then sure, toss another challenge at them, but throw them a benny as well, like an extra power chip or shifting their danger meter up/down a couple of points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254807/#Comment_254807" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T12:56:08+00:00" title="February  3, 2010 12:56PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...perhaps I should go read further on one of the other Danger Patrol threads, to see if there is any sage advice there, as well.

Ended up printing out half the comments on there. That'll teach me not to read through the other resources before posting stupid questions! Dumb, dumb gremlin!!<br/><br/>Anyway, I would still like to hear people's thoughts about describing staged threats to the players, as well as any good ways to help players with their Interludes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
