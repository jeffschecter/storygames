Instead, you see adventurers come back and just claim they killed a dragon, get showered with gold, glory, everything you ever wanted.<br/><br/>So you go out, buy a sword, barge into a tavern and tell everyone you just slew a pesky Manticore out in the wild lands!<br/><br/>It's a little like Munchausen, but a team game - the players work together to tell a story!<br/><br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadesofvengeance/era-lyres-pocket-edition" rel="nofollow">If you're interested, you can get the game from the Kickstarter for \xa31!</a><br/><br/>We're adding content to the website for every Stretch Goal we meet! at <a href="http://eralyres.shadesofvengeance.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://eralyres.shadesofvengeance.com</a>, we're putting up a Bestiary and Locations page for every \xa3100 we bring in for the project!<br/><br/>Anyway, questions welcome!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
