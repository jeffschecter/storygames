Don't try to play it, because it will hurt your brain unless you computerize the "between the circuits" part.<br/><br/><b>Setup</b><br/>Put 100 points in the pool (loose change where each penny represents a point, for example)<br/>Everyone makes a GAME CREATOR. Give him/her a name and a SKILL of d6.<br/><br/><b>Play</b><br/>Play goes around the table with each person taking a turn, moving clockwise. On the first turn, everyone performs the Write a game action. On subsequent turns, perform one of the following actions:<br/> <br/><i>Write a game</i><br/>Name the game.<br/>Roll 2d6. Add your SKILL. The result is your game's INGENUITY. If this is the highest INGENUITY of your games, increase SKILL by d3.<br/>Roll 3d6. The result is your game's COMPLEXITY.<br/>Set the game's COST as 0.<br/>Give the game a starting BUZZ equal to your SKILL.<br/>Mark your name on the game's OWNED BY box.<br/><br/><i>Improve a game</i><br/>\tChoose one of your games. Roll d20.<br/>\tIf the value is higher than current INGENUITY, this value increases by d3. If this is the highest INGENUITY of your games, increase SKILL by 1.<br/>\tIf the value is lower than current COMPLEXITY, this value decreases by d6. Increase SKILL by 1. Decrease COST accordingly.<br/>\tIncrease BUZZ by SKILL.<br/> <br/><i>Publish a game</i><br/>\tChoose any one of your games.<br/>        Set the game's COST to be equal to current COMPLEXITY + GLOSS.<br/>\tSet a PRICE between 0 and 50.<br/>\tSubtract COST from PRICE and record it as REVENUE. If REVENUE is negative, set REVENUE to 0.<br/>\tMark the game as IN PRINT.<br/><br/><i>Apply gloss</i><br/>\tChoose one of your games.<br/>\tRoll 2d6. Remove this amount of points from your pool (or all your points if the value exceeds your total).<br/>\tIf the number of points removed is higher than the current GLOSS value, replace the current value with the new one.<br/>\tAdd the value from the highest die to the game's COST.<br/>        Add the value from the lowest die to the game's BUZZ.<br/>\tSet a new PRICE between 0 and 50 if you like.<br/>        Adjust REVENUE based on new COST and PRICE. If REVENUE is negative, set REVENUE to 0.<br/><br/><i>Buy and read a game</i><br/>\tChoose one of your competitor's games.<br/>\tPay its PRICE from your point total. The owner of the game receives REVENUE for the game.<br/>\tIf this game has a higher INGENUITY score than any of yours, increase SKILL by d3.<br/>\tMark your name on the game's OWNED BY box.<br/><br/>As a free action, you may also do either of the following on your turn:<br/><br/><i>Spread a game on the Internet</i><br/>\tChoose a game which you OWN (your own or your competitors').<br/>\tMark it as IN CIRCULATION<br/><br/><i>Download a game</i><br/>\tChoose any one of your competitor's games marked as IN CIRCULATION<br/>\tIf this game has a higher INGENUITY score than any of yours, increase SKILL by d3.<br/>\tMark your name on the game's OWNED BY box.<br/> <br/><b>Between full circuits</b><br/>Order games marked as IN PRINT and IN CIRCULATION in order or BUZZ, highest to lowest. In case of equal BUZZ, put games in order of GLOSS, then COST.<p><br/>Roll d20 - this value is called PURCHASING POWER (PP).<br/>If PP rolled is lower than the amount currently in the pool, go down the list of games in order:<br/> </p><blockquote>If the game is IN CIRCULATION and IN PRINT, roll 2d20.\n<blockquote>If the value rolled is higher than its PRICE - BUZZ + COMPLEXITY:\n<blockquote>Increase its BOUGHT value by 1.<br/>\t\t\tIncrease the game's CIRCULATION by 1.<br/>\t\t\tIncrease the game's BUZZ by 1.<br/>\t\t\tRemove PP or COST (whichever is lower) points from the pool<br/>\t\t\tGive the game's REVENUE value as points to the Creator</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If the value rolled is lower than its PRICE - BUZZ + COMPLEXITY:<br/>\t\t\tIncrease the game's BUZZ by 1.<br/>\t\t\tIncrease the game's CIRCULATION by 1.</blockquote></blockquote>\n\tIf the game is IN CIRCULATION but not IN PRINT:\n<blockquote>Increase the game's BUZZ by 1.<br/>\t\t\tIncrease the game's CIRCULATION by 1.</blockquote>\n\tIf the game is not IN CIRCULATION but its PRICE - BUZZ + COMPLEXITY is lower than PP:\n<blockquote>Increase its BOUGHT value by 1.<br/>\t\tRemove PP points from the pool.<br/>\t\tIncrease the game's BUZZ by 1.<br/>\t\tGive the game's REVENUE value as points to the Creator</blockquote>\n\tIf the game is not IN CIRCULATION and its PRICE - BUZZ + COMPLEXITY is higher than PP:\n<blockquote>Decrease its BUZZ by 1</blockquote></blockquote>\n\tFinally, swap the game's position with the game just below it in the order (note: this is broken, games should trickle down - errata forthcoming)<br/>If PP is higher than the amount currently in the pool\n<blockquote>Reduce the pool by 1 and<br/>\tStarting from the BOTTOM IN CIRCULATION game on the list, roll 2d20 as above and evaluate. Whenever a game is BOUGHT, remove it from the order.</blockquote>\nWhen all points are gone from the pool\n<blockquote>Reduce BUZZ on all games by 1.<br/>\tRefill the pool with 100 points and start the circuit over.</blockquote>\n<br/><b>Quitting the game</b><br/>A player may quit at any time, setting their own win conditions. Suitable win conditions could be: highest total POINTS, highest total BOUGHT, highest total CIRCULATION, highest total BUZZ, highest total INGENUITY, highest total GLOSS, or any combination thereof. I'd personally go for a high total SKILL among all GAME CREATORS.<br/><br/>When all players have quit, everyone has won, except those who claim they didn't.<br/><br/><b>Sample game</b><br/><br/><i>Living with File Sharing: The Game</i><br/>INGENUITY: 4<br/>COMPLEXITY: 18<br/>COST: 18<br/>GLOSS: 0<br/>BUZZ: 2<br/>PRICE: 0<br/>REVENUE: 0<br/>IN CIRCULATION<br/>OWNED BY: Lachek (and now, you too!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286792/#Comment_286792" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T13:07:12+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  1:07PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Future supplements will include rules for Creative Commons licensed games, game design cooperatives, and backstabbing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286800/#Comment_286800" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T13:29:36+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  1:29PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2010 1:30PM by lachek.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another action, suggested by the ever-growing fan community, the implementation details inspired by <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12743" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>:<br/><br/><i>Critique game</i><br/><br/>Choose any game.
