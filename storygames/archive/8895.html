I don't know much about the machinations behind the current decision but I can give you some insight into the challenges that led to the decision.<br/><br/>Basically, the Camarilla is a "global chronicle" - it is a LARP that basically anyone can join by creating a character in accordance with published rules, organizing a game and paying a fee.  Then, your character can basically be taken to any other "venue" where it's permitted by the local folks and everything that's happened in your game has happened in theirs. This is so incredibly great. The mysterious and awesome events of your game are shared not in blog posts or in actual play posts, but <i>in-character</i> with all the inconsistent narration and confusion that entails.<br/><br/>However, there's an inherent problem to this approach - the World of Darkness games, even the relatively limited ones, are extremely broad.  A Vampire game can be very political, or it can be action-packed, it can be quirky, sad, dramatic or bombastic.  That is a good thing about Vampire, not a bad thing!  But there's no question it creates tension.  Not only would Mr. Darcy not jump a sports car off an exploding ramp, he would merely look sadly upon someone who had. <br/><br/>Normally this tension is not resolved.  In practice, if people want to play in a game long-term, they make a character for that game and play it in the style of that game with the other characters.  In the short-term, it's exploited for yuks at best and some eyes are rolled at worst.<br/><br/>But the other challenge the Camarilla faces isn't breadth, it's depth.  Because a game can go for many, many years, it becomes increasingly difficult to slot in new players at the "normal starting character"'s power level while still providing interesting material for those who have a massive pile of experience. And it is very discouraging to new people. You start to wonder, often, why you are here, when someone already fills the niche you wanted and does it better than you possibly ever could. (And you'll never catch them, since you're all gaining experience at more or less the same rate!)<br/><br/>The idea of resetting character stats, and/or re-doing how experience is handled, is one way of addressing (some of) these problems (partly).  <br/><br/>I've actually kicked around the idea of a Camarilla venue, but:<br/><br/>A) it would be small, <br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> it would be limited in time, <br/>and C) it would probably be a mortals game based around detectives and police officers of various stripes, which would make crossover play ridiculously stupid...<br/><br/>all of which make Camarilla stuff completely useless.  I suppose it's my griefer's instinct alone that leads me to think flinging a venue like this into the Camarilla would be great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196638/#Comment_196638" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T07:20:19+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  7:20AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, despite my cynicism, I rather like the idea of the Camarilla. When I was a member of a similar organisation, One World By Night, I could travel anywhere in the US and be fairly assured of a bed for the night and some roleplaying. It was rather pleasant.<br/><br/>Like you say, the difficulty is that the older characters are hugely powerful, with power to beat down the newer ones. There's then a disincentive to abandon your old character, because you'd lose all that power. So the idea of a reset, to level the playing field, is actually rather a good one.<br/><br/>Ironically, a Camarilla-style organisation might work better with indie games, because there's less emphasis on character advancement (in terms of New Powers). A national Shadow Of Yesterday organisation, for example, might work rather well.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196640/#Comment_196640" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T07:27:07+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  7:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not so into vampires, but your world-wide police drama larp sounds awesome, Jason.

You can do a mortals-only game (and in fact it is cheaper to do that, since you only have to buy one book!) There's also werewolves, other shapeshifters, mages, Changelings, etc.<br/><br/>Basically you can create any game you want under the published rules and come in and register it.

As noted above, even if we somehow managed the power-level balancing, there's still the giant problem of <i>content</i>. Even if I did my game, and registered it as a Camarilla venue, what possible benefit would that be? The characters wouldn't be able to interact with most of the other groups (supernaturals talking about supernatural things should not do it in front of cops) and if they did, nobody would care that we managed to nail the armed robbery guy but the axe murderer is still out there and if we can just get his partner to flip, blah blah blah.

You don't want to buy the most expensive house on your block.  Same principle.<br/><br/>Also, the organizational tools available to us in the mid-90s were pretty crude compared to what's available today. Just knowing what a "wiki" was would have been a whole new vista of amazingness for us. But yeah, organizationally, it's a real challenge, in a good way!  There's great benefit to continuity and the feeling of reality for someone to say "I research topic X" and for us to look up an answer and say "you discover player A" and get conversations/plots going that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196730/#Comment_196730" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T19:27:25+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  7:27PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been in an out of the Camarilla over the years. I kept going back hoping that the social aspect of the game would make up for how horrible it is to deal with the bureacracy of the Camarilla as well as certain other problems. The best way to understand the Camarilla is that it is structured like a cult. If you're new, you're getting dumped on, both in game and out. If you've passed the tests, gathered the special knowledge and ascended the ranks, then you shall be blessed with rewards, respect, status, positions and responsibilities (and bureacracy, a <i>lot</i> of bureacracy).<br/><br/>If they're trying to reset experience without changing the story, that tells me a lot. Over the past couple of years they started handing out buckets of experience points with which to make stronger characters. This sounds like it may be a method of balancing new characters with old, but it worked out the opposite. Established players (whether they were new or old characters) got a lot of xp, while newer players got less for their (obviously newer) characters. This may seem unfair, and it is, but I can speak from experience that you want power imbalances in a larp. It's just a really ugly way to achieve it, and perceived unfairness was probably part of why they're changing things. But if I had to bet money on anything, I'd bet that whatever they're changing it to will go awry in a year or two anyways.<br/><br/>What's going to really go badly is continuity. When character powers suddenly change due to an experience reset, well, you're probably all familiar with how it sounds when the crew encounters the fifth "only thing in the universe that creates tachyons." It's worse than that. I ran a mortal game after the new rules-set came out, and we had to go through an approval process to do anything that might impact upon or be visible in non-mortal games that occured in the same city. So, when a character wanted to do graffiti or paste up posters, I had to submit official requests for permission to let it happen in-game. Sound lame? Yes, yes it was, and it was in the name of protecting continuity. The more you wanted to do, the more you ran up against Camarilla bureacracy.<br/><br/>The only regret I have was not attending a convention. I'd like to see one of the big larp conventions of 1500+ people, but I'd show up for the con, play, then run screaming, lest I get dragged back into the rest of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I'd like to see one of the big larp conventions of 1500+ people, but I'd show up for the con, play, then run screaming, lest I get dragged back into the rest of it.</blockquote>\nThis is why I can't wait to see Wick's House of the Blooded Larp rules as I think his game is going for the same sort of organizational infighting, and I can't wait to see his ruleset. I just hope it's done in September as I was planning to run a game in my old stomping grounds.<br/><br/>Also the thing about rewarding people with in game power for out of game considerations is the main reason I didn't want to deal with the Camarilla. There are people who would have done lots of work to gain that power in my game and then they promptly would have destroyed my game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196798/#Comment_196798" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T08:09:16+00:00" title="March 13, 2009  8:09AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, we had a good experience with that. You're the one that sets up the chairs? You're the one that helps clean up the host's house after? You and you do the newsletter? Your character becomes cooler. This was in lieu of any kind of out-of-game reward. There's a lot of logistics involved in having 50 people come over to your house even if you don't cook for them. Some of it (rinsing out sink/unclogging toilet/taking out one thousand pounds of trash) is unpleasant, and we want to spread it around as much as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196802/#Comment_196802" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T08:14:24+00:00" title="March 13, 2009  8:14AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I quite like that idea.
