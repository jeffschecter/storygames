It's the sort of thing clubs (primarily Uni ones) used to do in the 80's and 90's. I seem to recall talk of games where the object was to keep the game going constantly which probably meant one GM, but the possibility for various players.<br/><br/>Ignoring that, sounds like you've got a full schedule, congrats. I've had the odd week where I accidentally ended up gaming 5 or 6 nights on the trot (when all the different groups and a Con/meet would all align) but I try hard to avoid it happening. I don't want to use up all the good will at home by mistake and after too much all grouped together (especially when some are running games), I just want the breathing space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428218/#Comment_428218" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-11T04:35:49+00:00" title="February 11, 2014  4:35AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Around here we usually attempt to maintain high session/year averages, insofar as competitive gaming goes.

And repeat that for each weekday.  Then on Saturday, I'd have the same morning but my folks would drop me off at a game store where I would play with a different crowd from like noon to ten PM.  And then on Sunday, my family would play a different D&amp;D campaign, set in the same world as our after-dinner game, with one or two of my friends for several hours.  <br/><br/>I doubt it's a "record" but you'd have to get up pretty early to beat the obsession and free time that suburban kids can bring to the table.  :-)<br/><br/>* I'm just making that up, it could have been any summer within a couple years of that, but 82 seems most plausible...<br/>** This means dialing into a BBS                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428223/#Comment_428223" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-11T07:40:14+00:00" title="February 11, 2014  7:40AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, you are (were?) a madman.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428225/#Comment_428225" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-11T07:55:53+00:00" title="February 11, 2014  7:55AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just presuming he *was* 14 (or some similar age). <br/><br/>Definitely part of the reason we didn't spend every day of the summer holiday gaming was that we didn't have anywhere sensible that we could go and game every day.
