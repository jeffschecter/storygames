This could probably be a little better written, but I think you'll get the idea:<br/><br/>From childhood every one of us has three internal critics. They live inside our mental landscape, as role models we aspire to be like, as critics who comment on our desires and our actions. We first encounter them in our daily lives. We meet them, live with them, hang out with them, read about them, hear about them, and they affect us deeply enough that we install them into our mental landscape and try to live as they would. They are real people, long dead historical personages, or fictional characters. At times in our lives we install a new one, but we only ever have three, so when we choose a new internal critic we uninstall one of the prior three.<br/><br/>Play this game with three people who don't know anything about your three internal critics. Tell each of them what they need to know to embody one of your internal critics.<br/><br/>"You are my father, John. He was valedictorian of his high school class..."<br/><br/>When you're done telling them what they need to know, have them discuss amongst themselves and then finally tell you who they want you to be and what they want you to be doing in ten years.<br/><br/>Continue with everyone taking a turn casting the others as their internal critics and hearing who and what they want for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_373270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373270/#Comment_373270" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-17T15:38:59+00:00" title="April 17, 2012  3:38PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is very interesting.

However, via Skype, you could even have them whispering directly into your ear via a headset, so that could be cool.<br/><br/>This is a game I've only tried once, so I suggest you try it yourself via Skype and see how it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
