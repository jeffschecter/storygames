It started as an "Apolcalypse World" hack, but developed into a different game.<br/>\nThe main theme is kinda similar to that of AW: your world has been f**ked up by something (someone, in this case), and you have to cope with it.<br/>\nThink of many fables and child books with talking/sentient animals and other similar creatures: the "Redwall" series, fables, the works of Beatrix Potter, "Watership Down" and the like. Imagine they all reside on the very same place/continent/planet/what-you-have, in the Realm of Fables. All the inhabiting creatures lived a quiet, simple and enjoyable life... until the evil witch-queen of the Fairy World, before being defeated by the local hero-prince, manages to cast a powerful spell that also impacts the Realm of Fables, bringing a real armageddon over there.<br/>\nMost of the inhabitants survive, luckily, but their world is no more so quiet and enjoyable: trees think, speak and move, and some of them even started liking flesh; the earth shakes more than what should be considered normal, and sometimes vile things come up from the bottomless pits that pop up here and there; many non-sentient animals start behaving in weird ways, often against their usual habits; magic is now almost a living creature, with a will and sometimes even a body.<br/>\nNow, they have to face all of this and maybe try to bring back some hope and trace of the old civilization, in order to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of the system, it stems from "Apocalypse World," as I said. Players gather around each session, using the first one to decide what happened and choosing the things they'd like to see in the upcoming sessions. They get to decide which creatures they'd like to play, for example, how weird their world has become and what changed. Each species has a list of interesting features and players will have to choose which ones have changed and how. Then, they choose a playbook and a species for their character. Playbooks, this time, come out from the classical heroic fantasy repertoire: the Mage, the Warrior, the Noble, the Wanderer and the Mystic. Each playbook has general-use moves and special moves for single species. This time, when you choose a playbook you have to acknowledge that there will surely be another character in the world who mirrors you in almost everything, and you'll surely have to confront him/her sometime.<br/>\nThen the MC starts describing things and moving NPCs. NPCs are divided in henchmen and real people, who also have shortened playbooks to ease the role of the MC. I still have to decide for Characteristics, harm levels and so on, but more or less this is the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n-MikeT                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369653/#Comment_369653" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T08:53:05+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  8:53AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, why don't you make it two "parts" which combine together (one for the character type, one for the species), sort of like in Danger Patrol, instead of a single playbook per player?

Imagine this: "class" playbooks' art and layout integrates with the "race" playbooks ones. For example, I imagined that the Wanderer playbook could have the picture of a path in the woods, while the Fox racebook could have the picture of a fox in the middle of a wood. Put them together and you have a Fox that ha started his journey in the wild.<br/>\nAnother thing I thought is that, during the game, the characters would change. This change can be due to many things: decisions took during difficult phases, for example. But two things that I find interesting to explore are the incorporation/refusal of the Weirdness that runs wild through the Realm and the transition to Human or Feral. These things could be important, because:<br/>\na) the Witch-Queen was a Human being; as such, creatures of the Realm of Fables consider them dangerous and even insane from that moment. But there are things that can make you lose your real nature to make you more and more human-like, thus colder, and some of them can be decided by the player: maybe trying to remain cool during an emotive scene, taking an harsh revenge against your enemies, destroying something "sacred" in the pursuit of your own goals, or even striking a deal with Humans trapped in the Realm can drive you more and more towards humanity. Humanity can even be a game stat, just like Cool in AW. On the contrary, if you let your emotions drive you, you can become more and more Feral, and still distant from the other Fable creatures. In the end, you might even end up as a true animal, losing yourself forever.<br/>\nb) embracing the Weirdness makes you weird. This causes physical and psychological mutations: you can start growing abnormal body parts, or develop a splinter personality, for example, but this gives you some bonuses, like extra moves or the possibility to resist to areas of wild magic and so on. A nice thing could be the chance for the player to add these "weird" details on the pictures in the playbooks, visualizing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-MikeT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369911/#Comment_369911" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T02:38:04+00:00" title="March 29, 2012  2:38AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Mike">@Mike</a>: definitely.

All characters will be anthropomorphic animals from child narratives and fairy tales.<br/>\nAll players will develop their own character using two playbooks, one for the character race and one for the character theme. The former will be chosen by all players together during the first session, and this will also let everybody check what they want to see in the game: each racebook, in fact, will have a list of race features that players will be able to change to reflect how their characters' world has changed. The latter will feature Moves and other things that will cover specific abilites and other characteristics of a specific fairy tale-inspired theme.<br/>\nRegarding the themebooks, they will cover, as I said, some themes and character concepts coming from fairy tales. Some examples:<br/>\n-the Wanderer: he can't settle down in a place for more than one day, and when he breaks this rule bad things happen around him;<br/>\n-the Heartless: during the magic apocalypse that turned their world upside down, the Heartless has been stripped of his own flesh, now replaced by inorganic materials. He's on a quest to regain it;<br/>\n-the Godfather: if you do what he asks you to do, you'll gain whatever you want, and viceversa. A character working on pacts and oaths to swear and break;<br/>\n-the Hunter: predator and marksman, the Hunter is on a quest for his own survival;<br/>\n-the Bearer: he owns a special object linked to his great destiny, but with special powers come special responsibilities;<br/>\n-the Reynard: a cunning trickster with a dreadful fate ahead;<br/>\n-the Fleshdancer: he lives in a skin that's not his own, but that gives him special powers. He can choose between keeping it and finding his real one.<br/>\nMore will come in the future.<br/>\nHope will replace Hx and Strings: you and other characters are the only chance of hope for this wrecked world. As you play, your character will see if to trust his fellows or not, and will be able to use this trust in others to do special things.<br/>\nCharacters will also have to face the Weird, an otherworldly force that has sprawled across the world, changing and reshaping it. They can fight it or embrace it: by embracing the Weird, they lose little bits of themselves, but can gain supernatural powers. Moreover, now that they know what humans are and can do, they can choose between remaining in their stance or changing towards humanity (losing their emotions) or towards feral animals (losing their minds).<br/>\n<br/>\n-MikeT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeT" title="MikeT"><img alt="MikeT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeT">MikeT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371352/#Comment_371352" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T04:52:57+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  4:52AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to update this game via G+: <a href="https://plus.google.com/113613753677984569531/posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/113613753677984569531/posts</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-MikeT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371439/#Comment_371439" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T10:54:11+00:00" title="April  5, 2012 10:54AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This gets more and more promising.

It had no specific name, because its inhabitants did not feel the need to differentiate it from others, and, indeed, hardly knew of the existence of realms other than their own. "The World," they called it, and it was enough for them. Its inhabitants were very different from each other: Dogs, Cats, Mice, Foxes, Wolves and more shared the World. Of course, they were different from each other, as I said, but harmony reigned between them due to an old treaty of truce, imposed on them in the first centuries after decades of bitter conflict. Together, they formed the People.<br>The People were animals, or Animals: they could speak, move, grasp objects, create, think and do everything a human can do. But they were not alone: the world was also inhabited by animals, those with a lowercase initial. Animals were... just animals, and therefore were their prey. For every People there was also its animal.<br>The World was formed by a small continent, about the size of what we call Australia. It was surrounded by sea and a single large river, with many streams flowing into and out of it, and covered by dense forests. Within these forests, in small and large clearings, stood the Cities of the People, spread all over the world according to the customs of each: some on treetops, some underground, some outdoor. Not all People built Cities, but you could find any kind of Animal in them, from the most shy to the most social, each with its commitments.<br>If any of us had been able to move in that idyllic world, he would see magnificent places and views, with rich Cities in a Renaissance style surrounded by wilderness, with fields and farms here and there spotting the green masses of woods and forests. A virtually perfect world.<br>What People did not know was that, beyond the endless ocean that surrounded the World, there was a "real" world, with islands, continents, archipelagos and all the rest. In one of these places magic was known and used. In that distant kingdom, the Prince in charge was engaged in a fierce battle against the militia of the Witch Queen, an evil spellcaster looking for fame and power that had begun an assault against the main local rulers. With his sword and shield, the Prince had reached the inner sanctum of the Witch Queen, when her, in a desperate attempt to save her life, attempted to cast a powerful spell of destruction, to eliminate once and for all the threat of the Prince.<br>But something went wrong: some say that the hero had killed the Witch Queen shortly before she ended to utter the spell, some say that this was diverted from a good heart or from his armor, some say other things. The fact is that the Prince killed the Witch Queen, dissolving most of her spells and then removing all forms of power to her armies. Shortly thereafter, he had the victory.<br>Most of her spells. Because one, the last she pronounced, actually did not fail. Rather, it swelled, lost power and broke into the World.<br>What happened next is confused, partly because it happened very quickly, partly because it happened differently in each area of the World. The only thing all the Animals saw and understood was about the color of the sky, which changed from blue to red. Blood red, bright red, a colour not easily forgotten. It was a flash, but remained in the memory of all, to the point that the day went down in history of the World as the "Red Day."<br>From that moment everything changed. The Strange made its entrance into the World, a force hitherto unknown, but living, although impalpable, and can change everything it enters in contact with. It penetrated into the trees and mountains, into rivers, animals and People, deeply changing many of them. The trees began to speak, some to move, some more... to eat. The leaves of some oaks near a bend of the great river became metal, rocks along the estuary still drip  blood. It is said that somewhere in the woods further away from the Cities of the People exists a living being formed with all the bodies of an old pack of wolves\u2026<br><br>Soon I'll write about the other parts of the game. I'm planning to rebuild many of the Themebooks I had in my mind, focusing more on the relationships among characters.<br><br>-MikeT                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeT" title="MikeT"><img alt="MikeT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeT">MikeT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383564/#Comment_383564" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T08:57:42+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  8:57AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Hope</b><br>Hope is the mechanic I'll be using to substitute AW's Hx. Hope represents how much you trust someone, and thus how much you hope in his/her help in case of need. You can give a character Hp in every moment, but when you spend it you're asking him/her to do something for you. In that case, the player (if it's on a PC) or the ST (if it's on an NPC) has to roll with Hp. On 10+, the character does what is asked without questioning. On a 7-9, he gets to choose between: doing it but requesting something in change; not doing it but giving the other character a +1 against him until he gives him back 1 Hp; not doing it, but receiving a Condition stated by the requester; not doing it, but losing all the Hp given to the requester.<br>I plan to give Moves for Hope to every Themebook.

The idea of this Move is that with Hp you have an emotional lever on the other character, and with 10+ you impose your pressure on him/her in a way that compels him to to your bidding.

We had two Wolves, a Fox, a Bear and a Mouse revolving around a case of stolen properties, emerging guides and general manipulation.<br/>The character and world creation was quite quick (under one hour), but the lack of guides in character detailing slowed it down quite a bit. Players also felt the lack of rules to "investigate" and a general "bloating" in terms of game options and rules.<br/>As such, I'm narrowing it down to better fit the sword&amp;sorcery mood that I feel best working for my game.<br/>Sadly, I still haven't translated all the completed Themebooks, but expect in the future a full revision of the rules.<br/><br/>-MikeT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream" title="daniel_ream"><img alt="daniel_ream" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream">daniel_ream</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389871/#Comment_389871" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T21:30:15+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  9:30PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so I'm ridiculously late to this party, but the first thing I thought when I saw the OP was "The Secret of NIMH, except they don't get out in time."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeT" title="MikeT"><img alt="MikeT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeT">MikeT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389879/#Comment_389879" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T01:33:31+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  1:33AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a pity I can't remember that movie...<br/><br/>-MikeT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeT" title="MikeT"><img alt="MikeT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeT">MikeT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391394/#Comment_391394" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T02:17:33+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  2:17AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just finished working on the Themebooks.

I liked the idea, anyway, but I also acknowledge that not all prospective players might like it as I do. So, in order to mitigate possible negative aspects of the thing, I want to add the possibility to change it to totems, clans and so on, so that basically you still play it with human-like characters. Animals, in fact, are just archetypes: Wolves represent command and order, Foxes sexuality, innocence and wit, Badgers calm and hardness, Dogs loyalty, grudge and faith, and so on.<br/><br/>-MikeT

Well, for a variety of reasons:<br/>A) because I'm just an amateur and I don't feel it would be fair to make people pay for my work;<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> because I know how it feels not having the necessary budget to buy a game you like (it's the same for me), so I think that I can be more helpful by providing people with free things to play with;<br/>C) because the game is still in development and it won't be fair, IMHO, to make people pay for something that is going to change a lot in a couple of months.<br/><br/>-MikeT<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeT" title="MikeT"><img alt="MikeT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeT">MikeT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481109/#Comment_481109" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-12T10:29:24+00:00" title="March 12, 2019 10:29AM">March 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I updated the playtest material for the game.
