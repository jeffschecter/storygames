In particular, one of the players came up with the idea of his character being an escapee from a cargo cult based in a local football ground; the cult worship the aliens as gods and attempt to become like them, using cast-off alien detritus to modify themselves.<br/><br/>I really want to base a mission or two around dealing with these people in the physical world, and while there is a mention of doing stuff like this in the rules, I'm still wondering about the best way to handle it mechanically.  Has anyone here got any experience of running or playing missions like this and, if so, what advice can you offer?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178954/#Comment_178954" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T07:33:33+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  7:33AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thought is: save it for near-er to the end of the game. One, because out-of-dream missions are simply harder than in-dream missions, and two because staging them will require some experience staging missions. Once you figure out the basic ebb-and-flow of a mission, doing variant missions (multiple pilots, out of the dream, etc) becomes easier.<br/><br/>Seth had some interesting experiences with this, I think.

Basically, there kept being scenes in which my pilot was making plans to go out and raid.  And then, when we got to that scene, I was like "I kinda think Jason should be shot," so we started the scene right after he'd just taken a bullet, since that was the important part.  It was very dramatic.<br/><br/>Personally, I kinda like keeping the mission rules just to the dream world stuff, to keep things separate and distinctive, but I could also see an argument, I guess, as to having the dream world and the real world begin merging together closer to the end of the game, as pilots' Bliss keeps going up.  The chief problem with using the mission rules to accomplish things in the real world is that, mechanically, only the pilots have stats, so it's impossible for Anchors or other non-pilot characters to do anything mechanically.  We don't even know what all their relationships are, so it's hard for them to draw those in for dice.  However, the way the game's set up, everything is supposed to be focused around the pilots anyway, so that might not be insurmountable.<br/><br/>Would you just bring in relationships like you do in the "cheating" version of Dogs, where you can invoke relationships in the middle of a conflict (instead of before, like you're technically supposed to in the rules)?  But they wouldn't necessarily symbolize anything in the real world?  Or maybe a pilot would role dice representing all the characters who were cooperating in trying to accomplish something, based on their combined intimacy with those characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178969/#Comment_178969" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T08:36:17+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  8:36AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Seth had some interesting experiences with this, I think.

So, that means that we would have only used dice from characters who were actually present and could do something useful. In our case, that would have been Kay and Joseph. As a result, you don't really have a lot of dice to work with.
