There are clearly elements of early RPG design that encouraged this kind of behaviour, but far and away the larger factors of influence are social and demographic (socially maladjusted white male adolescents being the primary consumers).  As traditional rulesets have evolved and gamers themselves have grown up, this "cult" is on the wane and (though clearly no real way of statistically knowing) I would venture represents a minority of traditional gamers today.<br/><br/>My main "political" agenda in posting this is to try and break down the assumption that some people seem to make in the storygamers community that if you are playing with a traditional ruleset than you are also playing with all the negative elements that have been associated with bad gaming over the years: fascistic GMs, avoidance of critical discussion around the game, player disempowerment, etc.<br/><br/>So here is one phenomenon of evolution that happened in all my long-term gaming groups: rotating GMs.  Generally, in the early days there was one or two motivated GMs or the group that I joined was started by a single person who was the GM.  But over time, other people wanted to give it a shot or someone else joined the group who had GM'ed.  Eventually, in all these groups, it turned into a revolving door of GMs where each person got their shot to take over and run a campaign.<br/><br/>Why is this significant?<br/><br/>So many things happen when a group has multiple GMs.  First of all, it opens the doors to other players having a GM's experience and thus that perspect on the current GMs game.  This encourages dialogue and growth.  Second, the transition from one GM to another always encourages a lot of dialogue.  The new GM has to pitch his or her game to the rest of the group.  Sometimes the order isn't set, so there is something of a competition of campaigns.  A new GM that may have wanted to do something different with social elements of the game can now introduce those changes, which may or may not get integrated into the culture of the group (but the door becomes open to ask those questions).  The change of GMs often also encourages the changing of systems as well (though not always, which would be an interesting phenomenon to look into).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337436/#Comment_337436" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T10:47:08+00:00" title="August  6, 2011 10:47AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would add that rotating GMs is specifically textually supported in Vampire (along with many other White Wolf games) all the way back to the very first edition in 1991.

Actually, in most of the groups I played with when I was younger, there was a lot of peer pressure to run a game.  "You should totally do it," they'd say.  "You'd be good at it.  It's not that hard, either.  Tell you what, just run this module to get your feet wet, you'll get the hang of it in no time."  The more potential GMs you could create, the better!<br/><br/>Sometimes that pressure was a bad thing; we played some shitty campaigns because the person who had been harassed into running a game really wasn't into it, wasn't having fun, and their lack of enthusiasm was contagious.  Or someone's eyes were too big for their mouth, starting a campaign and abandoning it after a few sessions.  Or someone was just bad at it, or their style/what they wanted didn't mesh with anyone else's.  At those times, everyone would cast significant glances in the direction of the people who were generally acknowledged as the best GMs in the group, and wonder (sometimes out loud) if they had something they wanted to run at some point, you know, if they wanted to...<br/><br/>But other times, it was pretty much awesome.  New blood, new ideas, new game systems...and a lot of out-of-game conversations between people about the best way to run a game and how particular rules worked and all that kind of thing.  Switching GMs from game to game helped keep things moving and postponed gaming burnout.<br/><br/><br/>One thing no group I've been in has ever really been able to manage has been rotating GMs on the same campaign, though.  That seems to be a game-killer for some reason, I'm not sure why.  (I know that I'm not a big fan of doing it because I find trying to coordinate with another GM is more stressful than fun, but that wouldn't explain why no one else I've played with has been able to sustain it, either.)<br/><br/><br/>edit: Oops, I didn't mention how my current group handles it: GMing a game is a strictly voluntary deal for us, no peer pressure allowed.  If you've got a game you want to run, pitch it to the group, we'll probably play it.  If you don't want to run something, don't.  If that means that some month everyone is burned out or too busy or whatever to run a game, we'll do something else on Saturday instead; eventually someone will get the urge to run a game, and we'll go with that.<br/><br/>In practice, this puts the same person in the GM chair for most of the time, as we have one person in our group who really, really loves running games (and whose games we really, really love playing in).  The other potential GMs like doing it maybe once a year, so they bank their idea and wait until the usual GM wants a break before pitching it.  But we still change campaigns/systems pretty much every three months, even if the GM doesn't change: we like endings, and we like getting to switch genres/styles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337463/#Comment_337463" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T16:34:36+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  4:34PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience was that rotating GMs lasted only about 1 rotation.

Indeed, my very first gaming experience was with a group of my friends, playing D&amp;D (we didn't really distinguish between editions back then). We even made it a rule: we take turns GMing. We did see a whole lot of this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>we played some shitty campaigns because the person who had been harassed into running a game really wasn't into it, wasn't having fun, and their lack of enthusiasm was contagious.  Or someone's eyes were too big for their mouth, starting a campaign and abandoning it after a few sessions.

Would have been the same with any GMed game, new or old.<br/><br/>Really, I only have one objection or counter-point to this whole issue:<br/><br/>A lot of very significant/influential "trad" RPGs textually and mechanically supported the "GM Mystery Cult". I remember reading everything from, "roll dice behind a screen, and never let the players know you changed a rule, it's your job to keep them happy", to, "In an RPG, you can do Anything You Want! The GM will make whatever you choose into a cool story, don't worry!"<br/><br/>Texts which implored over and over again for GMs to do many many things to mislead the players and lie to them... for their own good. That told you in no uncertain terms that the group's fun was the GM's responsibility, and that if the game was not going well, you just needed a better GM.<br/><br/>How big an objection is that? How much of an impact did those texts have? I have no idea. Maybe lots, maybe very little. But if they did have an impact, I'm sure it had something to do, even if just a little, with the GM Mystery Cult and similar phenomena.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337475/#Comment_337475" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T18:26:53+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  6:26PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't believe we haven't even tuched on the giant trend in games to have secret parts of the setting only the GM knew about! Deadlands was the king of this, but that's probably my own biased experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were all of these elaborate plots and story arcs the players had no chance to buy into since they were supposed to be kept secret. Hell, in Deadlands? The GM could barely buy into them, since they saved lots of secrets for the sourcebooks.

The party in particular is a costume party, although a peculiar one in that the theme of the party and the costumes are all mostly expressed verbally.<br/><br/>The rules system and the encounters or whatever are effectively themed party games. They're bobbing for apples or pin the tail on the donkey or, I dunno, busting a pinata.<br/><br/>The host's job is to make folks are having fun and interactiing and to keep things somehow related to the party theme.<br/><br/>To me, RPGs aren't really games. They're fun, imaginative activities, with moments of games built in and used occasionally, like the way we might do bobbing for apples at a Halloween party, or we might carve some jack-o-panterns later on.<br/><br/>In this view, all of those suggestions to do stuff that might seem a bit odd make more sense. They're tools to keep the overall event on track and fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337513/#Comment_337513" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T09:40:16+00:00" title="August  7, 2011  9:40AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bob,<br/><br/>What about the occasional reminder "not to let the players know HOW you make it fun for them"?<br/><br/>Isn't that a bit like asking the host of the bobbing-for-apples party to pretend that, "Hey, look at that, all these apples just accidentally fell into my bathtub!

These are old texts and the negative influence on play some of them might have had is diminishing if not gone altogether.  Traditional players who are playing with currently supported systems are not getting that kind of advice.  People who are using these older rulesets today are using re-crafted versions of them that contain very different kinds of GM'ing advice.  <br/><br/>I'm actually curious, as I'm not even sure those kinds of advice were all that prevalent even back then.  I suspect much more of that kind of GM mystery behaviour was a function of the natural power play between adolescent males.

It may even go into ways that you can make that game more fun and game more fun and accessible for your guests ( Use smaller apples are a smaller pan of water for the younger guests. Split up competitions for younger and older competitors). Heck, it might even encourage a certain amunt of host intervention to keep things fun and the overall party rolling. For a kids birthday party, it might encourage shouting Warmer/Colder as clues for our blindfolded young'uns to have a better chance of  Pinning the Tail on the Donkey, even if this does undercut some of the competitive aspect.<br/><br/>Those suggestions are there to make the overall party activity more fun. They're exactly in the same vein as encouraging GMs to roll dice secretly or even fudge roills if necessary in the nname of the overall fun of the RPG party experience.<br/><br/>Bringing this back around a bit, part of the Mystery Cult of the GM and the Cult of the GM/Player divide can be chalked up to some rather simpler things I think.<br/><br/>The number one thing I'd point to is that players are simply not encouraged to read much of anything rules-wise that doesn't pertain to running their character.<br/><br/>This is something that has been with the RPG hobby for a very long time.<br/><br/>I don't think players were very often discouraged actively from learning rules/tools, but there is decidely a culture in place that makes it acceptable to never bother learning many mechanics by way of book reading.<br/><br/>I mean, if you do reveal that you know non-character rules, you may well end up dragooned into GMing a game...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337528/#Comment_337528" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T12:24:40+00:00" title="August  7, 2011 12:24PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2011 12:25PM by komradebob.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>I suspect much more of that kind of GM mystery behaviour was a function of the natural power play between adolescent males.</blockquote>\nTons of RPG play culture goofiness can be traced exactly to that, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337534/#Comment_337534" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T14:20:05+00:00" title="August  7, 2011  2:20PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>I suspect much more of that kind of GM mystery behaviour was a function of the natural power play between adolescent males.</blockquote>\nI'd go a step further and say that much of the dysfunctional behavior attributed to the games of yore (power-tripping GMs, passive-aggressive players, etc.) was/is a function of the natural power plays between adolescent males.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337543/#Comment_337543" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T15:08:40+00:00" title="August  7, 2011  3:08PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bullshit.

It starts with the dungeon: it's secret. Then you get the Player's Book/GM Book format (perhaps with admonitions to keep the GM book away from players).

Keeping in-game secrets and keeping secrets about how the game is run are not the same thing, which is I think what JDCorley was getting at:  you can't point to a GM not revealing <i>in-game</i> secrets and say that it's evidence of a GM Mystery Cult, because that very same GM might be totally cool with telling the players all about the methods used to run the game (how pacing is handled, what gets done when an NPC is needed on the spur of the moment, what kinds of pressures are being put on the PCs, that there are in fact in-game secrets to be discovered in the first place, etc.).  For example, I might ask the GM, "Hey, who is that masked bandit who kidnapped my character's sister?" and the GM might reply, "Your character is going to have to investigate that, because that's what this whole story is about," and that is totally kosher.  The GM is explaining to me that the goal is a story about tracking down my sister's kidnapper, not smiling enigmatically or telling me to shut up or laughing in my face.  No GM Mystery Cult there, just a GM preserving an in-game secret with the intention of making a fun investigation plot possible.<br/><br/>And yeah, I suppose that in some cases the one might reinforce the other (keeping the conspiracy of the Order of the Dragon a secret might make a [bad? insecure? nervous?] GM avoid talking about all the things being done behind the scenes to make that conspiracy a good nemesis for the party), but it doesn't HAVE to, any more than not keeping one secret means you have to go on and blab about every secret.<br/><br/><br/>I was under the impression that the whole "GM Mystery Cult" concept was that GMs are supposed to never tell anything to the players about <i>how</i> the game is being run.  No explanations of why a particular ruling is made (no explanation should be necessary, the GM's word is law), no communication about expectations or what the goals of the game are or negotiation about what the genre conventions are, etc..  You know, basically being a dick to everyone else at the table and avoiding engaging with them as fellow participants in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337568/#Comment_337568" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T23:00:27+00:00" title="August  7, 2011 11:00PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The concept that players should not know certain things, even rules, existed.

I suspect it has something to do with the motivation for keeping the text a secret, and what text in particular is being kept secret, and whether the GM and the players discuss that motivation in some way.  I mean, there are a lot of possible scenarios where that definitely would not be foul play, and lots where it definitely would be.  Just saying "Hey, don't read that" doesn't automatically lead to bad gaming; I'm not even sure if it can be argued that it <i>often</i> leads to bad gaming, not without some other major things going wrong at the same time.<br/><br/>We've kind of wandered away from the thread's topic, though, so maybe we should just disagree on this and leave it at that.  I do think that part of the advantage of rotating GMs in a gaming group -- not even on the same game, but just generally having different people run games instead of having one and only one person do it all the time -- is that it encourages openness at least among the people who take on the GM role.  Nearly every new GM has questions to ask of more experienced GMs, and once you start talking about how you run your games, it gets very hard to STOP talking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337575/#Comment_337575" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T01:00:09+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  1:00AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2011 1:02AM by JDCorley.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Keeping in-game secrets and keeping secrets about how the game is run are not the same thing, which is I think what JDCorley was getting at:  you can't point to a GM not revealing<i>in-game</i>secrets and say that it's evidence of a GM Mystery Cult, because that very same GM might be totally cool with telling the players all about the methods used to run the game (how pacing is handled, what gets done when an NPC is needed on the spur of the moment, what kinds of pressures are being put on the PCs, that there are in fact in-game secrets to be discovered in the first place, etc.).</blockquote>\nRight, that's what I was getting at.

That's good and fun.<br/><br/>I don't like, "I can't tell you how this game actually works [e.g. where my ideas for NPCs come from] because that's Not How It's Done."<br/><br/>Secrets in the fiction are fun. Secrets between the people playing, and how they make the game more fun... that's not such a good idea, even if it can work on occasion. Why can't we talk about how to make the game more fun together? I mean, if you don't want to, you don't have to. But if you feel like it's Forbidden, without even asking why (as I've seen), that's a drag and can lead to some dysfunctional stuff happening at the table.<br/><br/>For example, I used to play with a (great) GM. (He was the same guy who said that a game without combat is not an RPG, by definition.) He was adamant that an RPG experience had to consist of a prepared scenario known only to the GM. To do otherwise (as many new games were suggesting) was bullshit and not really gaming.<br/><br/>This same guy (an intelligent, mature, educated human being in his 30's, not some pimply teenager) ran improvised adventures for us all the time. He showed up with "nothing prepared", then made stuff up by rolling on a few random tables and going with the flow. The games were fun. But he could not admit to himself that he was running "off-the-cuff". If you asked him how he ran the game without prep (which he admitted to at the table, after all), at most he might shrug and say it was a mistake or a bad night or something.<br/><br/><br/>Olman/walkerp,<br/><br/>My apologies if I somehow derailed this whole conversation. I wasn't trying to open a can of worms.<br/><br/>You said: "This Mystery GM Cult thing is not fundamentally connected to traditional gaming." I replied: "I agree with most of your arguments. However, there's one thing I've seen, which is a lot of advice in these books - and then from the people playing - which do push gaming in that direction." A classic example is the admonition by some to keep your GM screen up and roll dice behind it even if you have nothing prepared.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to back down from taking this argument any further if you don't think it's relevant. I no longer own any of those books, so I can't look through to find any quotes for you.<br/><br/>But I do believe you when you say that it's diminishing over the years. At least, I certainly hope so!

I have them do stuff that makes sense given what information they have about their opponents.<br/>I fuck up the PCs, but I don't fuck with the players.<br/><br/>Contrast that with our current GM who seems to be taking a fairly adversarial stance in relation to us as players. And as a result is fucking up the PCs and fucking with the players.<br/><br/>I use "fuck up" and "fuck with" because I think these two concepts are typically conflated in GM Mystery cult behavior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337605/#Comment_337605" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T09:44:34+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  9:44AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, no need to apologize.

A game designer can't think of every way the rules can be misinterpreted and add enough countermeasures for bad GMing or playing. So, authors have to believe their readers will use the book as a tool for having fun instead of using it to torture and bore their friends to death. Of course, authors can facilitate the mechanics and even their point of view about what's fun in RPGs, but further than that you can be talking about turning an RPG into something that will make people grow as a person, a concept that goes into the self-helping section of the bookstores, instead of the gaming section.<br/><br/>Not that I believe that's something a Game Designer should be afraid of doing, providing the game itself is really fun and well done, so much that you don't mind becoming a better person by playing it. I leave it up to the designer to decide what does "being a better person means" and the consumers to decide if that's worth the price of the book and the bothersome part of GMing and playing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337609/#Comment_337609" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T09:56:47+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  9:56AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2011 9:57AM by WarriorMonk.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW walkerp, I think the reason there's still a lot of people bringing up the mistakes of ancient times is because doubting of the legendary arcaic rulesets was one of the primary forces behind the rise of indy games.

They're better now--both the players and the texts--*because* of the influence of these games *I* like. Heck, maybe they're ONLY better insofar as they borrow that good stuff from my favourite new games!"<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>The "trad" apologist is saying, "Just because there was a bad Dungeon Master's Guide at some point and some pimply 14-year-olds had a miserable time playing the game doesn't mean the type of gaming I enjoy sucks. Stop painting me with the same brush! I like to play fun games with maturity and skill, and I do."<br/><br/>The "indie" evangelist is saying, "Boy, those older games sure sucked! But I see you're having more fun now, good for you. But it's only because you read Dogs in the Vineyard and are now applying some of that advice to your D&amp;D game, so that doesn't count!"<br/><br/>In other words, going from Suck to Good in one's gaming is associated with just plain growing up and being reasonable in the first guy's mind, but the second guy can't disassociate those improvements from his switch to a different style of gaming. In the second guy's mind, the only reason the first guy is having a good time playing D&amp;D is because that guy is applying stuff from indie games: "Let It Ride" from Burning Wheel, "Say Yes or Roll the Dice" from Dogs, or whatever else he's seeing in that group's playstyle.<br/><br/>It's easy to see how they can talk past each other!                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337828/#Comment_337828" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T11:43:09+00:00" title="August  9, 2011 11:43AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, this is exactly right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The Cult of the Mystery GM and rotating GMs - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14844/the-cult-of-the-mystery-gm-and-rotating-gms/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="The Cult of the Mystery GM and rotating GMs - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14844/the-cult-of-the-mystery-gm-and-rotating-gms/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Well, excellent!

So this has nothing to do with *trad gaming* in my mind."<br/></blockquote>\nHm.  This doesn't ring true to me.  I don't think most traditional gamers see the old days as being dysfunctional and current period as fixed.  From my experience, there still are and always have been some bad gaming and bad gaming texts - just as there has always been fun gaming and good game texts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338082/#Comment_338082" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T14:58:34+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  2:58PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really?  You don't look back on your adolescent gaming period with a certain mixture of fondness and also chagrin?  We had a ton of fun, but we were younger and stupider and less wise.  Hell, I "suspended" one of my players for a month because he secretly went out and bought the DMG.

You don't look back on your adolescent gaming period with a certain mixture of fondness and also chagrin?  We had a ton of fun, but we were younger and stupider and less wise.  Hell, I "suspended" one of my players for a month because he secretly went out and bought the DMG.

There was plenty of my adolescent gaming that was, well, adolescent.  Sexy slutty supervillains featured in some of my early Champions games, and there was plenty of dumb jokes and low humor in D&amp;D and other games.  Still, I don't regret or express chagrin over that - it was part of my youth, and I don't think there was anything dysfunctional about it.  <br/><br/>I suspect this is a common difference of experience.  Some people had very bad experiences with traditional RPGs that prompted them to entirely switch to indie games as an alternative. Others have not, though, and may be fine with traditional RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338093/#Comment_338093" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T15:55:10+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  3:55PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good point, John.<br/><br/>And there also some, surely, who enjoy the GM Mystery Cult and find their fun in precisely that form of gaming.<br/><br/>I didn't mean to imply that all "trad gamers" (whatever that even means) feel this way or follow this line of reasoning, just that it was a possible line of thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14844/the-cult-of-the-mystery-gm-and-rotating-gms" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14844/the-cult-of-the-mystery-gm-and-rotating-gms" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14844/the-cult-of-the-mystery-gm-and-rotating-gms/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14844%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14844%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
