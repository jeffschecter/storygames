Thing is, I didn't do it because I <i>assumed</i> that total knowledge of the rules was my job and my job alone, I did it because the players <i>expected</i> me to do it. Frankly, that's the thing I hate the most about GMing: the idea that the GM is supposed to be the Guy In Charge Of The Rules.<br/><br/>I don't think it's really about rules complexity.

Usually the GM is the one who has the rules, and suggests playing the game in the first place. There is a quite different role of 'organizer' that usually gets conflated with GM, and the organizer is usually the one who knows the rules and advocates the game. Other players need to play for quite a while, and like what they are playing *and* have money, before they are willing to buy their own rules. I see that all the time. I've been running GURPS for the same group for 5 years now, and I am still the only one who owns the rules, so its inevitable that I am the rules guru as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136632/#Comment_136632" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T07:48:50+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  7:48AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron and David, agreed on both counts.<br/><br/>Ron, I've been in that boat too, many times. I do think it's a problem of rules complexity, though. A light rule set doesn't require as much investment to learn, and you can reasonably expect everyone to catch onto the mechanics of Risus in half an hour or so. As a GM, you may be called upon to <i>adjudicate</i> the rules, which I think is fair. Granted, anyone could take on this role, but it's not unreasonable to thrust this onto the GM.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you cannot reasonably expect players to understand anything but the basics of a 5-book run of GURPS (okay, perhaps also the specialized rules dealing with their own niche). You also cannot reasonably expect a GM to have 5 books of rules in their head. Thus, <i>in my experience</i>, you end up with three possible modes of play:\n<ul>\n<li>Only use the basic roll-3d6-under-your-skill for everything</li>\n<li>Flip through the book for five minutes every time someone tries to do something</li>\n<li>The GM fudges up some rule combo from tidbits she recalls in that particular instance</li>\n</ul>\nTo me, that makes GURPS useful as an engine for sim play, whether you have hardcore players who want to flip the rule book every five minutes, or players who don't give a crap about the rules and want the GM to act as a blackbox representation of the game world.<br/><br/>It makes GURPS useless to me as an engine for any other type of play, where I claim that players must be able to know enough of the rules to be able to use them to serve their personal creative goals. For example, if you can't grasp the intricacies of d20 combat you will not achieve victories in D&amp;D. If you can't grasp how Crew dice work in Matt Wilson's <i>Galactic</i>, you won't understand how to use them to push for an address of the central conceit of the game.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if that's even controversial.<br/><br/>David, in the referenced thread, I do mention the idea of the GM being the one who owns all the rule books. So yes, for that reason and for the other ones you mention, I agree that it's an understandable pattern. I guess I would argue it's a pattern I often find destructive, though. The GM has investment in the game and tries (with varying results) to make it rub off on players. The players who don't share the same degree of investment are unable to learn the complex rules. In effect, those players are limited to sim-exploratory agendas.<br/><br/>If you've played the game for a very long time, especially if the rule set hasn't changed drastically in that time, it is entirely possible that everyone has a good grasp of the rules by now and can use them fluidly and competently to serve their creative goals. In that case, good for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136633/#Comment_136633" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T07:56:20+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  7:56AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I'd say we were in that later position of rules grasp in my GURPS campaign, after many years of play.

The main area of complication is in character and campaign design, where the choices are mind-boggling. A Xerox machine and a black marker is all that is needed to make that process simpler for players, and once it is done, there's not much in the way of complication there except, as Hituro mentions, in a few situations.  If I was going to do an aquatic noir game, I would definitely put the rules for drowning on a cheat sheet - in a game set in a desert if someone was going to be drowned I would probably have to flip through the book.<br/><br/>As someone who always communicates all rules changes to the players whether they want to hear them or not, due to my ego and self-important narcissism, I can tell you that I've put a full GURPS campaign cheat sheet on 4 large-print pages, and never had to look in the book for anything again. Those pages included all the systems that I thought were likely to come up in our 6-9 month weekly campaign and I was virtually always right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136642/#Comment_136642" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T08:50:06+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  8:50AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, if you make 1000+ pages of rules (let's say Characters, Campaigns, Infinite Worlds, Space and Fantasy, for a typical sci-fi/fantasy crossover) fit onto 4 pages, haven't you in effect cobbled together your own lite system from one massively complex one?<br/><br/>I'd like to see those pages.

The actual rules used in play (well, in play of the actual narrative events, not the play of 'making a campaign and a character', which is a whole sub-game in GURPS) are not that significant.  Campaigns even less so.<br/><br/>Infinite Worlds consists - for the most part - of more campaign generation options, a giant catalogue of worlds, and some pregenerated campaigns, none of which is necessary knowledge to actually playing the game.  I haven't seen the new Space one but the Third Edition one was, again, mostly campaign generation options, with the exception of the space vehicle rules. If I anticipated building and flying vehicles tactically would be a big part of the game, I would probably have to add 1-2 pages to accomodate that.  I don't have Fantasy so can't comment, are there a lot of new rules there?<br/><br/>The flip-through-the-book-a-lot issue for me becomes when: A) I am designing the game and trying to figure out what level of specificity for skills I want to have, which skills and advantages/disadvantages are appropriate, if I want to use one of the plugins (Martial Arts had a cool set of these in Third Edition), and when I am communicating this to the players, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> I am designing an NPC in a campaign where I have decided a high degree of specificity is appropriate or the players are designing their characters.  <br/><br/>Once those two things are done, and I've done some planning as to what kinds of things I can reasonably expect to happen, the amount of GURPS that remains is frankly minimal.<br/><br/>You say "haven't you in effect cobbled together your own lite system from one massively complex one?" but I have no idea what that even means.

My experiences back up Mikael's point:<br/><br/>I've played D&amp;D (3rd edition) only a handful of sessions, but I really was restricted to agendas other than "competing in combat". It wasn't really an option. In combat, I would take advice from other players and roll dice, or try stuff and roll dice, in both cases having no idea how it would turn out.<br/><br/>I also played in a GURPS game that lasted two years (!). Despite the fact that I knew the rules pretty well, the _application_ of rules in that game is so fluid that it's hard to know what will happen at any given moment. For instance, is the GM using the "bullet shyness" rules, or the morale/reaction rules for your opponents? If he/she is, will they choose to apply them _in this particular instance_? Same goes for various modifiers, when we decide to go to round-by-round action, etc.<br/><br/>Even though I felt that the GM was impartial and very consistent, I never felt like I could go into a situation like a combat and compete in any meaningful sense. For instance: I'm trying to land an aircraft, but weather is bad. Is this a routine action (no roll)? A challenging one (3d6, roll under)? A routine action, but with added challenges (possibly a straight roll, but at a bonus)? Or a difficult one (skill roll at a penalty)? <br/><br/>Just as in the D&amp;D games, my character's effectiveness was pretty unpredictable for me. Even after two years of play. And I'm serious when I say that the GM was very consistent in his rulings. It's just that he might working with different information and assumptions when making those calls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136657/#Comment_136657" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T10:45:01+00:00" title="March 27, 2008 10:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2008 10:46AM by lachek.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I've taken away from GURPS Characters is that <b>every single skill, advantage and power</b> adds special rules. That makes Characters far more than just a chargen book, to be tucked away as soon as the game begins. Quoting from GURPS Lite 4th (which is the only one I have available at the moment):\n<blockquote>Carousing (HT/E)<br/>This is the skill of socializing, partying, etc. A successful Carousing roll, under the right circumstances, gives you a +2 bonus on a request for aid or information, or just on a general reaction. A failed roll means you made a fool of yourself in some way; you get a -2 penalty on any reaction roll made by those you caroused with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>High Pain Threshold (10 points)<br/>You are as susceptible to injury as anyone else, but you don\u2019t feel it as much. You never suffer a shock penalty when you are injured. In addition, you get +3 on all HT rolls to avoid knockdown and stunning \u2013 and if you are tortured physically, you get +3 to resist. The GM may let you roll at Will+3 to ignore pain in other situations.</blockquote>\nIIRC, the full-fledged Characters also has rules for Magic, Psionics, Martial Arts and so on. Every single entry has special rules associated with it. This is an aspect of GURPS I really like from a "crunch" standpoint - near everything you put on your sheet has a mechanical effect in game. The in-game effects of using one of those resources doesn't have to be hand-waved with some arbitrarily chosen outcome. Having said that, that same crunch adds a lot of complexity to the rules, which I've found results in one of the gameplay methods I outlined above.<br/><br/>I haven't read Campaigns or Infinite Worlds, but I have glanced through Space, Fantasy and Magic. By and large, they follow the same format as Characters - detailed descriptions of character resources and their effects. Obviously, not all 1000+ pages of rules need to be used in any given session, and given the preparation of a good set of cheat sheets customized to each particular player and their abilities, I suppose the books won't need to be extensively consulted with every throw of the dice. It's a great thing to hear that you're doing this for your players, Jason. It has not been my experience.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>You say "haven't you in effect cobbled together your own lite system from one massively complex one?" but I have no idea what that even means. Of course I am playing a house version of GURPS. Everyone who plays GURPS, <i>or any game</i>, plays a house version of that game.  I don't get what you're saying.</blockquote>\n(emphasis mine)<br/><br/>Are you referring to the Lumpley Principle there, Jason? Are you calling a version of D&amp;D with a strong scene structure a "house version" of D&amp;D? I can sort of see that argument, but comparing that to the "pick what you like from the smorgasbord of options" approach GURPS provides is a bit of a stretch, don't you think? If it were the case that everyone played a house version of their various games, organized play like the RPGA or Camarilla LARP wouldn't work.<br/><br/>If you were to say that GURPS is different in this respect, and that it's perfectly normal to pick 5% of the rules found over 5 different books and compile it into a comparatively light-weight system customized for your campaign, that's cool. It's not how I perceived GURPS running in general, but I could be wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136662/#Comment_136662" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T11:02:52+00:00" title="March 27, 2008 11:02AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I also disagree with JDCorley -- On the scale of games in general, GURPS is really damn complicated.

I think something to keep in mind is that games like GURPS and HERO in particular are unfocused toolkits. E.g., the acceleration/deceleration rules in HERO exist because, well, things in the real world accelerate and decelerate, so you obviously need rules for that. *Despite* the fact that the rule text will explicitly say (again and again), "Don't use these rules if it doesn't make dramatic sense." And the GM is the only one empowered to make that call. The "lite" RPGs of the '90s dealt with this issue by simply not having a lot of rules, making "there's less stuff you have to ignore" a selling point.<br/><br/>Basically, it's a byproduct of using a system that conflicts with your goals (or has vague or contradictory goals), i.e., stuff Ron Edwards has written about at length.

GURPS Lite:\n<blockquote>In any question of rules, the GM\u2019s word is <i>law</i>. The GM decides which optional rules to use, and settles any specific questions that come up. A good GM discusses important questions with the players before deciding \u2013 and a good player accepts the GM\u2019s decisions.<br/>The GM should know the rules thoroughly. When the rules do not cover a situation \u2013 or when a decision about the \u201creal world\u201d is needed \u2013 the GM can use several techniques:<br/>Success rolls<br/>Random rolls<br/>Arbitrary fiat<br/></blockquote>\nNote that in all three of these resolution techniques, the GM has final say. In practice (in my experience), these rules are not typically applied "when the rules do not cover a situation", because this is GURPS - there are rules available to cover almost any situation. No, in practice, these rules are typically used when the GM doesn't feel a particular rule should apply, could produce bad results, or when she feels looking it up would ruin the drama. In our GURPS game, play consist almost entirely of success rolls, with an occasional nod towards random rolls and arbitrary fiat.<br/><br/>So what I'm saying here is not "GURPS is bad because X tends to happen", thus a response of "GURPS says X should happen, so how is it bad?" is missing the point. What I'm saying is, producing general toolkits where the GM is intended to selectively pick a very small subset of the total available rules is a very bad design principle for anything but actor-stance immersionist sim play - play where the players are uninterested in the rules, and simply want the GM/rules-complex to portray a blackbox which spits back the results of their actions. It becomes clearer if you read the original thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136688/#Comment_136688" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T13:16:18+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  1:16PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, for one thing, I'm not handling the selection of skills/advantages/disadvantages alone, the players are too.<br/><br/>Typically when I run GURPS, there are around 20-30 skills that I identify as being interesting for our game.  The players pick from these skills what they're interested in. It is just flat not true that every single skill has some bizarre new rule in it.  The Carousing rule you list is actually a subset of a lot of other skills that can be generally stated as: in the appropriate social situation, a success at this skill will give you a +2 bonus and a failure will give you a -2 penalty.  I didn't have to learn "oh, Carousing, yes, that gives a bonus sometimes", I <i>select</i> Carousing as one of the skills that will do so and scratch off, say, Flower Arranging.  (In a game of courtly samurai, Flower Arranging would be picked and Carousing scratched off.)  And there are typically about the same number of Advantages and Disadvantages. Those are a bit more problematic as far as individualized cheatsheets, but again, some fall into general categories: gives a social bonus in a certain situation, gives a contact, causes you to have to make a Fear check, and so on.<br/><br/>(The lowest number of skills I ever used in a GURPS game was 8. That game also had a total of 3 Advantages and 3 Disadvantages. It was a broad-based pulpish game. It was damn fun. This is an outlier. It is also, as noted above, exactly what GURPS "intends" me to do, not that I think that matters at all.)<br/><br/>I have no idea what the Lumpley Principle is and at this late date in my career have little interest in learning.  When I say everyone who plays any game plays a house game, I mean that everyone reads the text of the game and takes something away from it, and they use that something to play a game with, but the amount that each group takes from the text is different, and what they take from the text is different, and how they interpret what they take is different and how they implement their interpretation is different, so any resemblance of any RPG <i>actually played</i> to any other RPG actually played is coincidental and probably meaningless compared to the vast sea of completely different implementations. The designer is dead and was hit by a bus immediately after publishing, so nobody can know what they meant anymore.<br/><br/>But I think your point is about something totally different from all of this, the relationship between GM, prepared material, and players, which I really and truly don't get, because it seems to be equally true for any game I can think of that has anything even remotely like the GM, so I will leave that alone until I have some idea what the hell you're talking about. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136692/#Comment_136692" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T13:25:37+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  1:25PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2008 1:28PM by lachek.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>1.

Your two points are intertwined very closely.<br/><br/>My claim that only Sim play can be successful in GURPS play is based on the three play methods I outlined above. David/Hituro and Jason/JDCorley adds a fourth, which is that one can actually learn to use the system to serve other agendas quite well after extensive play with the same group of people, and that's fine. I'm positing that a game system which can only be played non-Simmy with success after 5+ years of practice should either only be used for Sim play, or had poor design assumptions from the get-go.<br/><br/>Interestingly, two of the remaining three play methods correspond directly to two of the three methods for resolving situations the rules "do not cover":<br/><br/>Roll 3d6 for everything = success rolls<br/>Fudge together some rule in the moment = random rolls<br/><br/>What remains is "take time to look up every rule" and "arbitrary fiat", which seem like exact opposites of each other, but are quite related - they simply shift the role of GM and rules in the GM/rules-complex closer to one side or the other. So I claim that there are really two ways to play GURPS, assuming you do not have intimate knowledge of the system (where system is defined via the Lumpley Principle) only arrived at through extended, continuous play with the same group:<br/><br/>On the one hand, you could look up every rule and apply it in meticulous detail, with the GM having final rules arbitration privilege. This appeals, generally, to sim-style wargamer peeps. Note that the agenda here is not the "game" in "wargamer" but rather the simmy and exploratory aspect of wargames. I'm not a wargamer, but this playstyle would be my preference between the two.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you could simply state your character's actions with the understanding that the GM, acting as a complex world operating according to variables you cannot hope to comprehend, will spit back the results. You, the player, do not give a crap whether the GM is juggling calculus in his head in order to arrive at the conclusions, or whether she simply hand-waves it - all you know is that on a roll of 6, X happens. The less you know about the process, the better. This appeals to players who want to explore their character and the world in actor-stance, which is also a very simmy agenda.<br/><br/>There you go.

Your method of selecting a very small subset of GURPS' total ruleset is fantastic. It's not the norm where I come from.<br/><br/>Anecdote: When we were moving from a Space- to a Fantasy-based campaign, I suggested lowering the number of starting character points, as I had found GURPS to work better for me when played at only somewhat-better-than-average skill levels. The idea was questioned by one of the other players, on the basis of "I need those points to make a believable character, because of all those small skills like Cooking". My response, a little flabbergasted perhaps, was "well, why don't you just ask [the GM] for a list of skills which will never matter in the game, write down the ones you want in a character bio, and just play as if you were competent with them?". Apparently, to everyone else this sounded like cheating or something. We were given 150 points. The majority of those points were spent on skills which will never come up in game.<br/><br/>My point is that unless players (as opposed to GM) are able to learn the full extent of the rules, agendas other than Sim cannot be successfully pursued. Therefore, I consider designing a game according to GURPS principles (large ruleset intended for physics simulation, where the GM can pick and choose what rules she likes to use) a bad idea if the game is intended to also cater to gamist and narrativist agendas.<br/><br/>As to how that relates to my quote at the beginning of this thread, I don't know. Ben was supposed to stab me over it, that's all I know. But you know, I'm having fun even without Ben.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136708/#Comment_136708" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T14:10:26+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  2:10PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really believe in the GNS level of the Big Model, so it would not be decorous for me to say whether what I do is Sim or non-Sim or anything. <br/><br/>I can relate to your experience, but the game itself suggests that your method is perfectly reasonable within the bounds of GURPS - again, showing that each group takes from an identical text monstrously different interpretations.<br/><br/>Actually the RPGA was what I was thinking of to prove my point.

However, if I walk into a GURPS or HERO game, I have no clue what to expect. In those latter cases, all I can do is enter actor-stance, play my character, and accept that whatever comes of out the GM's mouth is as unquestionably true as any law of physics. When I'm in a mode like that, I cannot be either "gamey" nor "narry".<br/><br/>EDIT: D&amp;D is a bit of a special case, I admit, as its popularity has often led people to play it in unpredictable ways - usually by downplaying the combat rules (95% of the game) and creating house rules to make the game more story-like and less game-like, to prevent switching system to something more suitable.

Or heck, when doing meetups, meeting <i>online friends</i> and playing (note: This is My GenCon). <br/><br/>The RPGA comparison can fall apart a bit, because for most people (here, and most likely elsewhere) that's only a small percent of their gaming. A (fun) aberration. When RPGs take over the world and appear in casinos, then yeah I'll wave that flag of making sure that Dust Devils game that you sit in on in Monte Carlo (across from an international spy, an heiress and a business mogul) will be played the same as when you're dealt in at the Four Queens in Las Vegas with the vacationers and the old retired mafia guy. <br/><br/>So bringing it in as an example of how games across the world for a particular system should look alike... Kinda doesn't fit. I dunno. Most folks don't have the need to make sure that the game they play is played the same everywhere, unless your majority experience is with complete strangers, in new locations.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136737/#Comment_136737" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T21:53:18+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  9:53PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2008 9:53PM by Ron Hammack.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite><cite> My experience has been that I can walk into a game...

Why does this demand total knowledge of the rules? Assuming rules that don't heavily diverge from the way world works in most cases, one can make decisions according to that world, they will have thematic weight and they will be roughly correct.<br/><br/>So, what am I missing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136826/#Comment_136826" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-28T14:15:02+00:00" title="March 28, 2008  2:15PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Nar oriented games for example could have rules that don't model the way the world works, <em>at all</em>. <br/><br/>Also, the point of Lachek is not "players don't know the rules enough" (or well), but instead "players CANNOT know the rules that wil apply to any given session and/or situation, because the GM has free reign over what and when to apply, and how".<br/><br/>So, can you make significant choices towards a theme (mechanically) if you don't know the mechanics?<br/><br/>I don't know... can you really play PTA if you are not sure what method the producer will choose to know who wins the conflict and who wins narration? <br/>A game where the GM is <em>encouraged</em> by the book to decide if and when to use the rules, depending on "if they are working well with the story" is inherently incompatible with Nar play, I think: the GM is the one who is making the ultimate thematic choice, here, regardless of what the player was thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136828/#Comment_136828" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-28T14:39:58+00:00" title="March 28, 2008  2:39PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I quantify my house rules all the time.

A special case of this is a game where the rules produce results much like reality (this does not imply a heavy ruleset). General statement can be disproven by a special case. I think this is irrelevant and the actual point of disconnect is elsewhere.<br/><br/>I probably can't make a significant choice towards a theme mechanically if I don't know the mechanics, but that does not prevent me from making a significant choice towards the theme on the level of fiction. All that this requires is that the setting is sufficiently consistent. Setting can be consistent even when the GM changes, say, the level of detail the combat system uses from one combat to another, assuming the combat system is good (that is, the level of detail does not significantly change the overall outcome of the combat).<br/><br/>Assume, for example, that my player character's loved one has been captured and is held in a tower guarded by ten warriors. From what was has already happened in the game I know that defeating ten warriors is something my character probably could achieve, but it would hurt enough to keep him out of action for a week, during which something other important will happen. Trying the foolhardy rescue is now clearly a thematic choice, even if I can have no idea about the detail the combat system will use in this particular fight.<br/><br/>In Burning Wheel I did this all the time; I suggest the use of Fight! or Bloody versus or normal opposed roll based on what would be good for the story (are the stakes high enough to justify using the full Fight!-rules, for example). The players usually agreed. I knew the rules a lot better than they did. One of them is a casual player and does not really learn the rules by playing, at least not very well (and doesn't read books).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136877/#Comment_136877" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-29T04:42:52+00:00" title="March 29, 2008  4:42AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tommi, I get it. But the example you give is from a well done, consistent, Nar oriented (albeit crunchy) system. And what you are talking about is not drifting, or cherry picking, at all. Choosing the resolution level of detail for each conflict is, I gather, a clear rule and procedure in BW. The players *do* know that there are 3 mehtods, and that they will normally have say over which is chosen (or, otherwise, they will be able to back out of the intent, I guess).<br/><br/>The "cherrypick" systems instead allow the whole mechanics to exist in a sort of Shroedinger Cat quantum state in the head of the GM (and the GM alone). For each conflict (often for each dice roll) that continuum of options "collapses" into a specific ruling, generally based on a GM based thematic choice.<br/><br/>If the game overall system has rules for encumberance, weight, and the consequences of carrying a 30Kg backpack, it does not mean they will be used, or they will be used all of the time. So, when you leap the proverbial chasm, the GM will ask you to make a roll, and then will have free reign over applying the encumberance rules (and have you plummet down in the underground river, where you will have interesting (or not) adventures... or ignore them because you rolled relatively poorly and he wants the story to go on). <br/><br/>All of this without the player having authority over if and when the encumberance/weight rules will be applied, and often even without prior knowledge of it. <br/><br/>The game text has told the gm to act like that: he's following the rules! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>(all of this without entering the realm of "gm screens", where the gm rolls dice secretly, and/or chooses the target numbers without telling them to the players "because that's more realistic" and then fudging/inventing the results because the outcome contradicts what he feels is realistic/plausible/interesting/thematic)<br/><br/>If your BW player makes a thematic choice ("I choose to rescue the girl with a foolhardy attempt to storm the tower"), let's say addressing the theme "Your loved one is more important than your personal safety", but then the GM fudges rolls and bends rules to let you take the girl and run away without lasting wounds (say, because he had planned a "let's storm the evil baron castle" session next week)... was the theme addressed? Maybe (you as a player made the choice, that's right). But was it really meaty?<br/><br/>Bear in mind, the rules applying/bending/fudging could easily be used to block your attempt entirely <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Now, I know the examples always sound dumb and the "example GM" always sound like asshats. And some are. Many have actually been told for 20-30 years that that's the correct way to play ("don't let the players ruin your story!"). But many are just good natured guys following bad advice and bad rules texts.<br/><br/>I can't, from the top of my head, remember a single Nar/Story/indie game that mentions the dreaded "Change rules on the fly to accomodate the flow of the story" rule. And the rules themselves normally work very hard to NOT simulate reality (too complex and <em>needs</em> the gm bending regularly to have coherent results), but instead to drive the game and story towards the theme/tone they want.<br/><br/>I never need to worry about having the story flow in a thematically satisfying manner when I play Don't Rest Your Head.<br/><br/>I roll all dice in the open, and apply the results with gusto: the rules are crafted to create naturally a narrative of struggling with personal problems, exhaustion and consequences of madness.

I can make the same thematic choice (to fight the guards) in both games. I could do it in freeform play. It does not need the rules to support it, as long as previous play has informed the player so that the player can make a good guess at what will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe statement that started this subdiscussion was that one can't play nar or gam without knowing all the rules.

My thesis would be that, assuming a decent GM, there is certain rhyme and reason to fudging and ignoring the rules, if such happens. When playing long enough with a given GM or in a given game, the players will learn how the rules are actually used, and hence the play can go according to whatever creative agenda the group gravitates towards, even if playing GURPS. I think this is the way traditional Nar play works, along with all the modes of traditional play.<br/>\n<br/>\nForge games cut down the time it takes to learn the way the other people play, and hence allow for faster fulfilling play, provided the group likes the kind of play the game allows. Games that allow a great deal of play styles (that would be the toolkits) are slower to get used to, but can be used for many more styles of play after the group has learned to play together and sufficiently drifted the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136906/#Comment_136906" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-29T12:22:10+00:00" title="March 29, 2008 12:22PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who write the story?<br/><br/>In NAR games, the players should be the authors or the story.

That's why I'm reluctant to use terms like "bad GM advice". In a Sim-style game where the players rely on the GM to be their almighty world-blackbox - where play revolves around immersionist character exploration and/or consumption of a preset narrative - advising the GM to be flexible in order to preserve apparent logical consistency and maximize time spent on play is <i>great</i> advice.<br/><br/>And Tommi, <i>yes</i>. You are absolutely right. In a group where everyone has a comprehensive understanding of System (including social contract, division of narrative power, rules etc) it is possible to achieve playstyles other than Sim using GURPS. Much like, if you have a comprehensive understanding of chainsaws, you can use one to sculpt chess pieces or carve chicken.<br/><br/>Far as I see it, there are three problems with doing Nar play in GURPS.<br/><br/>One is tied to GM advice and Moreno's point - if the player is not the author in control of how premise is addressed, since they do not know the parameters of the rules they use, Nar <i>play</i> cannot occur. <i>Narratives</i> which in retrospect appear as though they address a premise can be produced, but they will be expert-authored rather than generated dynamically through play and those who participated know the difference.<br/><br/>Second, the (base) rules are clearly written with logical consistency in mind, as opposed to rules which are game-able or dramatic, and as such are useless for play other than Sim without some major tinkering, by adding drama points or instant CP awards or what have you.<br/><br/>Third, the sheer complexity of the rules (without doing some major rule-slashing like Jason) make grand-picture odds-calculation very difficult.<br/><br/>Example tying all three together: authoring something as straightforward as "our sad anti-hero retreats to his favourite sleazy bar, gets boozed up and finds himself a cheap lay for the night" might get complicated by things like Reaction and Influence rolls, both of which draw their variables from dozens of system attributes. If the GM finds it amusing, she may arbitrarily decide there's a 1/10 chance to get an arbitrarily chosen STD, or that a bar fight breaks out. As a result, you have no more authorial ability over the fictional world than you do in the real one. That's great fun if your intent is to "live the dream" - less so if you're trying to stay focused on a theme or make a statement.<br/><br/>Yes, some given GURPS GM might just say "okay" and move on to the next person, but the unspoken justification for not applying the rules is not "because I understand you were saying something important with that and I don't want to mess with it", rather "because it doesn't matter to the story, so let's sweep that under the rug and move on".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136967/#Comment_136967" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T07:25:42+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  7:25AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mikael, I see where you are coming from.

You are left with GM's fiat, basically.<br/><br/>For example, if you play (for example, and I am using this example because there is a lot of literature on the various basic endings of this game, and it's one of the NAR games where the GM has a more "traditional" role) a Sorcerer-like game with the GM that work like your "blak box" without rolling dice, there will be a point when (for example) the character will confront (for example) The Old One who he sold his soul to (for example). The classic Faust Gambit.  This, in Sorcerer-speak, can give these different endings: "Retribution" (the Hero fails, the theme is that you can't play with darkness), "Remorse" (the classic empty victory) or "the Outlaw prevails" (he get his soul back, win the girl at the end and goes to live happily ever after giving the finger to the devil). I think you can find many examples of each of these ending in movies, comics and literature.<br/><br/>The point is that YOU DON'T KNOW the theme of the story, until the story end. You don't play an already-written story, this is not story-before. If you play Story-Now (NAR), you discover as the audience the theme of your story in playing it. So, if at the end you say "I throw the contract to the holy fire", you will know the theme of the story ONLY AFTER the GM says to you "you made it, the devil scream, and get out cursing you", or "you made it, but not before the devil killed Lisa", or "you wasn't fast enough, the devil snatched the contract from your fingers and is laughing at you".<br/><br/>Now, in Sorcerer, this would be a dice roll (or a series of dice rolls) modified by your role-playing and from the situation and from all the bonus dice you could accumulate in the previous scene. You and the GM played your characters, and now the theme of the story will be decided by your input (both of you), fate, role-playing and from the reaction you will have to the dice roll.<br/><br/>Let's see your example. The GM is limited by "realism". So, what does this mean? Well, it means that Doctor Strange can' t enter the room, nor Santa Claus, nor the Silver Surfer. It mean that the Devil can't be Mary Poppins under a disguise. It means that the GM can't do a lot of stupid or inane things that he would not have done anyway. But what about the three outcomes above? They are, every one of them, realistic in the same way.<br/><br/>What happen is that the GM choose the "realistic" outcome that he likes more, and decide, by himself, the theme of the story. Decide THE STORY. If he like your character, the character will win. If he doesn't, the character will not win. And this in a completely "realistic" manner.  <br/><br/>"Realism" isn't a real criterion to choose anything. In any given situation where you would have rolled dice (not when the outcome is self-evident), there are a lot of "realistic" outcomes.<br/><br/>To be able to play NAR with a GM that makes all the outcome decision, that GM can't be a black box. He has to be a glass box. He can't decide the thematic decision alone by GM's fiat. There are other methods that can be used in that situation, but the important part is that (1) there is a real criterion, not "realism", and (2) this criterion is known by everybody at the table, and doesn't default to GM's fiat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136973/#Comment_136973" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T08:18:51+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  8:18AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Ben is attending Gamestorm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136974/#Comment_136974" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T08:22:22+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  8:22AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>I think Ben is attending Gamestorm.</blockquote>\nAh!

In your example, the dice would be rolled with predetermined results (not necessarily communicated, but certainly defined). If none of the options is more likely than any other, roll a d3 or something. Actually, I would use the normal rules if such exist. Again, assume the people know what Nar play is and don't go out of their way to prevent it. GM makes decisions based on what he thinks would happen and places those decisions on the dice. The players can make decisions that affect the odds; presumably, some holy relics might slow the demon and make destroying the contract easier (but getting such would presumably involve a complication like robbing a church or grave or something the demon would really like).<br/><br/>I feel justified in assuming the people know how to play Nar games and want to play them, because those two are also requirements for reliable functional Nar play with games particularly designed for such play, though less familiarity is probably required upfront.                        </div>\n<div

Thanuir</cite>Moreno, if blackboxing implies a lack of randomness</blockquote>\nNo, it assume that "the great and mysterious GM will give you the exact precise right outcome of what you wanted to do" with "right" meaning "right for the story", "right for realism" or for any other motivation that you can give, after-the-fact, to his decision about "how the story will go there". Only, don't look behind the curtain.<br/><br/>This make me remember myself, years and years ago. Too many years. I had played my first game (a game called "D&amp;D" but with the master that didn't have the books so he really improvised everything). It seemed like magic to me. And I wondered until the next game how he did it. I mean, how he could track the movement of every monster in the dungeon every single moment to know when we did meet them. There "secret rules for the GM only" has to be really rock-solid to be able to do this....<br/>...I let you imagine my disappointment when I discovered that he was really making up everything from his ass. He didn't even roll for encounters or count xp and hps, he only made the monster arrive when he was bored and drop dead when it was "realistic"... ;-)\n<blockquote>, I am using the wrong word. In your example, the dice would be rolled with predetermined results (not necessarily communicated, but certainly defined). If none of the options is more likely than any other, roll a d3 or something. </blockquote>\nSorry, I used the Sorcerer example because I assumed you were at least familiar with the game. Let me know some NAR system that you are familiar with and I will rephrase that example using one of them.\n<blockquote>Actually, I would use the normal rules if such exist. Again, assume the people know what Nar play is and don't go out of their way to prevent it. GM makes decisions based on what he thinks would happen and places those decisions on the dice. The players can make decisions that affect the odds; presumably, some holy relics might slow the demon and make destroying the contract easier (but getting such would presumably involve a complication like robbing a church or grave or something the demon would really like).<br/><br/>I feel justified in assuming the people know how to play Nar games and want to play them, because those two are also requirements for reliable functional Nar play with games particularly designed for such play, though less familiarity is probably required upfront.</blockquote>\nI am sorry, but I am not understanding what you are saying here. Maybe it's the language (English is not my native language) or it's because we are not imagining the same situation in that example, maybe it's better to wait until I can make an example using a system we both know.<br/><br/>[edited to correct "delusion" in "disappointment", the word in Italian is "delusione" and I always make this mistake...]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136986/#Comment_136986" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T10:33:28+00:00" title="March 30, 2008 10:33AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm Finnish, so there probably is a language barrier. Two-layered one, in fact.<br/><br/>I know roughly how Sorcerer works. The demon has some relevant rating, the character likewise, both roll that many dice, highest determines the winner, margin of success deduced from the rolls in a way I know but find hard to describe. I am most familiar with the Burning Wheel, just having run a game of it. One game of tMW and one of Universalis I have also played. But the discussion became a mess, so let us start anew.<br/><br/>Assume one GM and a bunch of players. Assume they know how Nar play works and have played tSoY (or something) before and it worked out fine. Assume they know each other. They play with the following extremely simple rules: When some outcome is in doubt and interesting (player or GM can invoke the "interesting" clause), one d6 is rolled. If it equals or exceeds target number, the action is successful (every interesting thing is thinked about as an action, which is not that difficult). GM determines target number by thinking about the probabilites; for very likely outcome, 2; for likely, 3; 50-50 situation or unknown, 4; unlikely, 5; very unlikely, 6. This decision is made based on the way the GM sees the reality. Players can argue about the target number and it is public before rolling. GM has final say over the TN.<br/><br/>That's it. For the record, I have actually run a game with that system. Not Nar play, though.<br/><br/>I am arguing that under the aforementioned conditions a group wanting to play Nar could accomplish it, even though the system is pure GM fiat. Note that this particularly includes the GM willing to run a Nar game. Hence, the situation and characters will be engineered to be suitable, like the Sword scenario for BW. The GM makes the decisions according to what would really happen (or what the rough probabilities would be), given the setting and situation. Why can't this be functional Nar play?<br/><br/>This is what I understand as blackboxing. It is a technique, not a creative agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136987/#Comment_136987" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T10:47:04+00:00" title="March 30, 2008 10:47AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2008 10:48AM by lachek.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tommi, you lost me.

The full scope of rules is known, but the point is that the effect is same as complex rules that simulate the setting and which are only known to the GM.

It just doesn't happen.<br/><br/>This is what does happen (going back to the jumping the chasm example)<br/><br/><i><br/>Player "I will leap the chasm!"<br/><br/>GM "But wait, you are carrying 150 lbs of equipment, you know you'll need to make a jumping roll to clear the chasm but it will be -5 because you are at extra heavy encumbrance"<br/><br/>Player "Oh shit! Well what if I shrug out of my pack before I leap?"<br/><br/>GM "Well then you'll be at straight jumping skill, or in your case DEX, since you don't have jumping"<br/><br/>Player "I don't want to lose my pack though ..."<br/><br/>GM "Well it's up to you ..."<br/></i><br/><br/>i.e. The players *ask* what rules will be applied before they do something ... and if they don't the GM tells them. We are all adults and all friends. We are not out to screw each other by rubbing our hands and cackling "But you never knew I was giving you -5 ... HAHAHA!". Of course it is better for everyone to know the rules and make optimal choices without prompting, but if you are the rules keeper you help everyone else.<br/><br/>And thus players *can* make strategic narrative choices without knowing the rules.

It just doesn't happen."<br/><br/>Let me assure you. It happen. A lot. Already, in this thread, a lot of people talked about their experience in these matters. Finding a SINGLE player ready to study a big manual like GURPS is difficult (and usually he is pushed to the GM's seat as soon as he is discovered). Finding an entire group of people like this is possible only if you search for them in a gaming environment, full of people that already enjoy studying big books full of rules.<br/><br/>I don't remember the numbers of the old WotC survey (somebody recall them?) but that survey "discovered" that a lot (over 90%) of the people who played D&amp;D did so outside of any "gaming environment". They don't go to gaming clubs, they don't go to gaming conventions, they only play, always with the same people, for years, in someone's living room (or basement). Most of the people that I know that play rpgs are like this. I think I have played with, regularity for years at home, outside of gaming conventions, with at least thirty different persons, and no-one of these was "met at a gaming store" or something like this. They were friends, friends of friends, co-workers, spouses, girl-friends and boy-friends of player. They want to have fun, they didn't want to study big books full of rules.  Less of a fifth of them was ready to study more than a single page of the AD&amp;D manuals, so they were the ones who played the magic-users and read their spell page, too (and sometimes they didn't read even that). Only four of them wanted to be the GM, too, and half of these didn't read the manual, too, but improvised everything.<br/><br/>At the time I too, thought that my work as the GM was to be "the one who know the rules", but I don't think that really work anymore. Doesn't work for me, anyway. I will not play a game where I can't teach the rules to the players too. All the rules. Because doing it differently mean pushing them around and pulling them by the nose ring while they look at my expression to see what they should do.<br/><br/>Why "what they should do"? Because without the understanding of the rules you are talking about, people don't ask about everything they could do. This would stop the game and get the bad looks from other players. To they ask at most a coulple of questions and try to understand from the answers what they should do.<br/><br/>Returning to the thread's topic...  a mysterious topic until Ben return... this thread went already all over the place. Some people are posting about the golden rule, others about the illusionst's veil, some other about the GM'fiat, others about a game where the players don't know the rules, others about GM's that function as a blackbox that give you "realistic" results, and some other people think we are talking about drift, GM's judgement about situational bonus, or narrational authority ... we are really talking past each other.<br/><br/>In my previous post I was talking to Tommy about GM's fiat in NAR games, and I will return to that topic in my next message, but this is now how this thread started (I was only answering to Tommy's last post, not to the entire thread). The opening post was about rule complexity, and the fact that most people really don't learn these complex rules when they play them. About this, I agree, as I already explained at the beginning of this post, it describe my experience, too.<br/><br/>After all, I became the group GM first ONLY because I was the ONLY one of an entire group of six experienced (more than four years each) AD&amp;D players, that had read over twenty pages of the damn "player's handbook"...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137077/#Comment_137077" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T22:38:20+00:00" title="March 30, 2008 10:38PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2008 10:38PM by Moreno R..">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thanuir</cite>I'm Finnish, so there probably is a language barrier. Two-layered one, in fact.<br/><br/>I know roughly how Sorcerer works. The demon has some relevant rating, the character likewise, both roll that many dice, highest determines the winner, margin of success deduced from the rolls in a way I know but find hard to describe.</blockquote>\nOK,so there is no need to rewrite the example, but only to clarify it. The outcomes I talked about (Remorse, Retribution, the Outlaw prevails, etc.) aren't in the rules. They are not an outcome of a roll. They are the outcome of the entire story.<br/><br/>In Sorcerer,you play with "something" (demons) that could cost your entire humanity, to get something you want enough to risk everything. The "story" end only when you (1) get what you wanted, or (2)lose all your humanity (or lose forever what you wanted). So, Ron Edwards in the last few pages of the book (page 123, if you have the manual) talk about the possible ranges of themes that can be obtained playing the game, and list the possible outcomes that the story can give you, based on the answer to (1) and (2):  As I said:<br/>- Retribution: the "hero" fails totally.<br/>- Remorse: the "hero" win an empty victory<br/>- The Outlaw prevails: the "hero" achieves the goals, keeping the methods (demons) under control.<br/>- Redemption: the "hero" achieves the goals, by putting asides the methods (sorcery) and trying another way enterely.<br/><br/>This is NOT, I repeat, the range of outcomes from a roll: is a categorization of the various possible ENDINGS of a story played for many, many weeks of real time.<br/><br/>And the "theme" of the story can't be decided before you get it's outcome. Because if you play your character as a Happy-go-lucky SOB with the charm of a robin hood mixed with casanova and james bond, and THEN he get a "retribution ending", the theme of the story becomes "You can't outrun the consequences of your actions forever", while, if you had got the outcome "The Outlaw prevails", the theme of the story would be very different.<br/><br/>The theme is INFLUENCED by your choices, in a NAR game, but you can't DECIDE it beforehand, because the theme is the answer to the premise. You play to find that answer. If you have already an answer, why play? Go write a book.<br/><br/>All this to say that what you wrote:\n<blockquote>You seem to imply that Nar play doesn't work with the GM or the rules as a blackbox for reality. I don't see why this would be true. Assuming participants who want Nar play and know what they are doing; that is, the characters have clear personal goals and the GM challenges those and does not put emphasis on unimportant stuff, but does work as a blackbox in that when given input, the GM gives out a realistic (given the setting) output, and the players do the same for their characters. The key is setting up the situation and characters so that it will all work out properly.</blockquote>\n...can't give you NAR play.  Every one of these outcomes is "realistic". If the GM can choose them by himself, by GM's fiat, you are throw out from the co-writer's seat, even if you don't know it. The story become of the GM's only. Reread my example for a more detailed explanation of how it happen, and remember that we are talking about games where the GM:\n<blockquote><br/>The GM should know the rules thoroughly. When the rules do not cover a situation \u2013 or when a decision about the \u201creal world\u201d is needed \u2013 the GM can use several techniques:<br/><br/><br/>    * Success rolls<br/><br/>    * Random rolls<br/><br/>    * Arbitrary fiat<br/></blockquote>\n..can use "Arbitrary fiat" every time a decision about "the real world" is needed....<br/><br/>Why Burning Wheel is different? Because in Burning Wheels the GM CAN'T, by the rules, write the outcomes alone. He has to follow the rules, the sames as everybody. He can't use GM's fiat to choose the outcomes<br/><br/>This mean that you could, in this case, play NAR? Yes, but without knowing the rules, your "free will" choices will always be limited by what other people will suggest you. Your thematic choices will not be made meaningless as in the GURPS case, but they will be limited in scope and made without a clear vision of what you can do.\n<blockquote><br/> I am most familiar with the Burning Wheel, just having run a game of it. One game of tMW and one of Universalis I have also played. But the discussion became a mess, so let us start anew.<br/><br/>Assume one GM and a bunch of players. Assume they know how Nar play works and have played tSoY (or something) before and it worked out fine. Assume they know each other. They play with the following extremely simple rules: When some outcome is in doubt and interesting (player or GM can invoke the "interesting" clause), one d6 is rolled. If it equals or exceeds target number, the action is successful (every interesting thing is thinked about as an action, which is not that difficult). GM determines target number by thinking about the probabilites; for very likely outcome, 2; for likely, 3; 50-50 situation or unknown, 4; unlikely, 5; very unlikely, 6. This decision is made based on the way the GM sees the reality. Players can argue about the target number and it is public before rolling. GM has final say over the TN.<br/><br/>That's it. For the record, I have actually run a game with that system. Not Nar play, though.<br/><br/>I am arguing that under the aforementioned conditions a group wanting to play Nar could accomplish it, even though the system is pure GM fiat. <br/></blockquote>\nWell, I think I found the problem in communication right here: you don't know what it's meant by "GM's fiat" (or, at least, you use it with a different meaning. Both way there is no difference in the incomprehension that this cause).<br/><br/>I (and, I think, everybody who used it in this thread before) are using it to mean fully drama-based determination of outcomes made by the GM alone, masqueraded or not as fortune (it depends if the GM make at least some rolling noise behind the screen or not): you describe what you want to do, you even roll some dice if the GM tell you to do so, but then, the GM decide what happen. No matter what you said/rolled.<br/><br/>This can happen in many different ways:<br/>- The GM simply choose the outcome that he want, without rolling.<br/>- The GM roll. If the dice tell the outcome that he wanted, good. If not, he disregard the dice and tell that outcome anyway.<br/>- The GM rolls. The dice doesn't give him the outcome that he want. But he can apply optional rule x, that give you a -2 penalty for encumbrance (he usually doesn't use encumbrance, but "in this case it's important"), and then apply a situational modifier of -1 for something and -2 for some other thing, and can get the outcome he want, by simply choosing what "optional" rules he needs to get that outcome<br/><br/>NAR Playing simply isn't possible when the GM can choose the outcome of any decision by GM's fiat.  (strangely enough, there is a kind a Gamist play that CAN be done like this. The goal of the gamist players become, obviously, to convince  the GM to choose the outcome that the player want. Many Amber players have experience of this kind of play)<br/><br/>But what you described isn't drama-based at all. In the system you describe, The GM can give drama-based modifiers, but the the outcome is fortune-based.<br/><br/>I can believe that you never played NAR  with that system, because it's clearly a SIM-facilitating system. But this would not stop you from playing NAR if you wanted, yes. You would simply drift the system during the game ignoring anything that stand in your way to doing so, arriving to a different system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137079/#Comment_137079" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T23:18:10+00:00" title="March 30, 2008 11:18PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno, given your definition of GM fiat, you are absolutely correct. If the GM actually pre-determines the outcomes, Nar play will be extremely hard or impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I define GM fiat as the GM's power over whatever that the players have no say over; that is, the GM can decide something in any way s/he wills. Particularly, the GM can decide to use the dice or can decide to default to a good idea given by a player or can decide to with with his or her own story idea. Under this definition, Nar play is far from impossible, that's my argument. If you don't disagree, we are done.

(The reason Nar play was not achieved is that nobody was trying to get it and the play is casual, just waiting for other games to end so something more dedicated can be started.) This could be taken to another thread or whispers, if you prefer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find interesting is that I have just run a BW game where the players were not terribly familiar with the rules. I dealt with it as I would have deal when playing any trad game: Tell them the options they have and how likely they are to work. "3 dice against difficulty 3 is 1/8 chance, but you can get extra dice if you have related skills. 4 dice would give a chance between 1/2 and 1/3, but if you fail, [nasty consequence] will happen. Still want to roll the dice?" Under this environment it is imminently possible to make actual choices, because the consequences of those choices are laid out. It does not change anything that the mechanics through which the outcomes are reachhed are somewhat unknown or hidden.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137603/#Comment_137603" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T06:53:51+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  6:53AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>Waiting for Ben Lehman</i></b><br/><br/><b>Alpha Playtest Version</b><br/><br/>The game requires approx. three to six players, all present at the same location.

If the GM can ALWAYS "go with her own story idea", and so can always change the result of a resolution into GM's fiat (or drama resolution based only on the story he want, if you prefer), then even choosing to NOT do it is drama based, and mean simply that the result given by the dice are the same that he wanted anyway, so why bother changing it?<br/><br/>People says sometimes that they enjoyed good NAR play with systems like these, but when you ask them about the way the played they usually react with some form of surprise or even disgust to the idea of a GM that would act in that way. For them, for the group they play, for their social contract, having a GM that would impose his "story" over the thematic statements of the players would be... unthinkable.<br/><br/>But this mean that they drifted the rules, and in a rather aggressive way: there is, written in  the Book, a rule so sacred to be named "rule zero" or "golden rule", if you ignore it like it was a misprint, you are drifting the system by the core. It's like you drew a big red line over it and added "never" in big red bold letters.<br/><br/>With a system drifted in this way, you could get a NAR game, I think (but it would depend on the rest of the system, maybe more drifting will be needed), but you get there by removing even the choice: the GM DON'T decide every time if he should override the system and impose his/her "story". Acting like that is unthinkable, he/she would react in horror even to the idea, so there is really no choice and so, no DRAMA-based choice about overriding or not.<br/><br/>If the GM hasn't that horrified reaction, and the system would give his/her the power to act over that impulse of "imposing his story" (an impulse that he/she doesn't think as "wrong" in any way), there can't be any NAR gaming.\n<blockquote><br/>Moreno, I'm interested; how do you think the brief system I outlined would be changed to accommodate Nar play?

Look it up and see the differences in (1) who decide how many dice, (2) who decide when to roll, (3) what the dice mean, (4) what you get from a successful roll. It's not the "only" way to play NAR, not by a long shot, but the comparison between your game and the Pool should show why I said that in my opinion a game where the GM assign different target number based on "realism" (and, I assume, narrate the outcome himself) in my opinion facilitate SIM playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138096/#Comment_138096" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T06:54:00+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  6:54AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><cite>Posted By: Thanuir</cite><br/>Personally, I define GM fiat as the GM's power over whatever that the players have no say over; that is, the GM can decide something in any way s/he wills.</blockquote>\nSo, ANYTHING the GM has authority over? Backstory, scene framing, npc's actions, etc.? It's a really big amount of things to put under "GM's fiat", actually there is almost nothing that the GM can do that isn't "fiat" with this definition...<br/><br/>If you are interested in the meaning of "GM's fiat" I used above, and how instead the authorities in the game (content, plot, situational, narrational) can be shared or not and how they are different from GM's fiat, there are some link that I think you will find very interesting:<br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20791.msg216100#msg216100" rel="nofollow">Silent Railroading and the Intersection of Scenario Prep &amp; Player Authorship</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1494" rel="nofollow">Bangs&amp;Illusionism, and now apparently the nature of language</a>and its forge follow-up and clarification,<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21694.0" rel="nofollow">Bangs&amp;Illusionism - in which Ron beats down Confusion</a><br/><br/>I am acutely not interested in a semantic debate, just wanted to let you know what my position was, that's all. I'll check out the linked discussions.\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>Particularly, the GM can decide to use the dice or can decide to default to a good idea given by a player or can decide to with with his or her own story idea. Under this definition, Nar play is far from impossible, that's my argument. If you don't disagree, we are done. If you do, there is still somewhere for the discussio to go.</blockquote>\n<br/><br/>But this mean that they drifted the rules, and in a rather aggressive way: there is, written in  the Book, a rule so sacred to be named "rule zero" or "golden rule", if you ignore it like it was a misprint, you are drifting the system by the core. It's like you drew a big red line over it and added "never" in big red bold letters.<br/><br/>With a system drifted in this way, you could get a NAR game, I think (but it would depend on the rest of the system, maybe more drifting will be needed), but you get there by removing even the choice: the GM DON'T decide every time if he should override the system and impose his/her "story". Acting like that is unthinkable, he/she would react in horror even to the idea, so there is really no choice and so, no DRAMA-based choice about overriding or not.</blockquote>\nThat makes sense; rules drift is something every group does whenever playing a game, and it makes sense that to achieve a specific style of play a specific drift is required.<br/><br/>I do disagree with it being something drastic; the GM (or the group) is still deciding when to use or not use the rules, but is making that decision based on something else than imposing his or her own story. I don't think this is particularly unusual; the golden rule zero does not say that the GM should ignore rules to override the contributions of other participants.<br/><br/><br/>About the pool; I know the idea (it holds some minor appeal). I was more looking for a minimal drift, so to speak; something that changes as little as possible. Something like a game hack.<br/><br/>About narration: I don't think it has great relevancy when it comes to CA. (In our group, we tend to be pretty casual about it such that whoever has a good idea can narrate. By definition, it is the one controlling the acting character, but GM often substitues something or gives an idea or so forth.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138612/#Comment_138612" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T17:54:05+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  5:54PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, OK, I'm bumping this because I'm <i>dying</i> to know--what <i>did</i> Ben want to stab Mikael to death over??<br/><br/>(I can't get full playtest data if we don't reach endgame!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138620/#Comment_138620" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T19:17:35+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  7:17PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I never thought Ben Lehman would be the kind of guy to punk out on stabbing someone to death.

By refusing to adjust my position to address other experiences, primarily from Jason and later from Tommi, I failed to convey those thoughts properly and confused myself with theory.<br/><br/>Here are those thoughts:<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly believe that buffet-style rulesets like GURPS or HERO primarily caters to Sim agendas, where the GM is tasked with the (impossible?) job of representing The World so that players can concentrate on playing Their Characters. When applied with a heavy dose of GM fiat, it becomes a tool the GM uses as s/he wishes to represent the world accurately, rather than a tool used by the players to empower their choices in that world. As such, the level of rules complexity is largely unimportant as long as everyone involved recognizes the rules are the GM's domain.<br/><br/>I was wrong in saying one could not play with Gamist or Narrativist agendas using such systems. After all, they are highly complex and buffet-style, so one should be able to strip off bits catering to a pure Sim agenda and arrive at a system perfectly capable of any kind of play. Whether I think this is good game design or not is a separate concern.<br/><br/>Whether one can actually successfully play with Gamist or Narrativist agendas without good knowledge of the rules is a more interesting question. The Amber throne wars example is neat, but I'd have to say I think the rules in this case are largely social and unwritten rather than mechanical and written, and discovering the rules are in fact part of playing the game. Nar play is more difficult to justify, but the examples I've seen so far all revolve around the GM explaining the rules and laying out all the options as the game is being played, which does not necessarily constitute an example of the players not knowing the rules.<br/><br/>Frankly, I can see arguments either way, and I'm not as convinced as I used to be. A game written with a Nar mindset could well achieve Nar play without the players knowing how all the bits work together ahead of time. Exhibit A, Dogs in the Vineyard - the game seems to be about gun-toting holy warriors until you start playing the game, taking Fallout, questioning the Faith, being driven out of town, etc. Exhibit B, Sorcerer - the game seems to be about bad-ass demonologists until you start messing with those Bangs and realize your Humanity is dropping, fast. These effects might actually be less interesting if you knew how the pieces were moving ahead of time.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you treat Fate points as Hero Points in disguise and hoard them so you never have to be Compelled, then your misunderstanding of how the rules of Spirit of the Century are meant to work is working against the parts of the game which drives Nar play home. If you never put your Crew at risk when you're playing Galactic because you don't think a single d8 is really going to matter that much, you will not see the Crew character grow and you won't see the central premise of Galactic in action.<br/><br/>It's more complicated than I first thought, and I appreciate the input of everyone who has helped me get to that realization.<br/><br/>No, Ben, that doesn't include you. Yours and Joel's contribution - the "Waiting for Ben Lehman" game - was gold, though. Can't wait to play!
