I'm looking for players in the area.  I only really have one player from my regular group who really gets into the whole "narrative" side of the roleplaying hobby.  I'm looking for like 2 or 3 more players (more would be fine) so if your in the East Valley and are interested reply here and I'll try to set up a meet up at an LGS or coffee shop or something.  I run a lot of games, but if your the gamemaster type then feel free to say so as I would love an opportunity to actually play in one of these games for once.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
