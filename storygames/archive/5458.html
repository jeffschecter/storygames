I really do.  I never know quite what to say, and anything I write seems to just restate the introduction to my game or is really boring.  I think my problem is because I don\u2019t understand blurbs very well.<br/><br/>When you read a blurb, what types of things stand out?  What do you want to see in a blurb before you even consider buying a game?  I\u2019d like to make my blurbs memorable, but I\u2019m really not sure how to do that.  So, I want to ask you guys, what makes a blurb good for you?<br/><br/>Examples are always helpful too <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122314/#Comment_122314" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T08:32:07+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  8:32AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the blurb for Committee a lot, it was what made me want to review the game.<br/><span style="font-family: Courier New;"><br/>This Meeting of the Committee is Called to Order... <br/> <br/>You braved crocodiles, Nazis, necromancy, and devolved ape men to find the mythical city and the secrets it holds. You tested your skills and resolve to their limits, driven by a secret desire that motivates you to greater deeds just as it blinds you to possible pitfalls.<br/><br/>Now you have returned from your expedition and must report to your peers on your daring exploits, proving to the hardened adventurers, geniuses, and polymaths gathered before you that you are worthy of their respect in your every endeavor. You\u2019ve gone into danger and survived driven by your desire\u2014now is the time to bring it to fruition.<br/><br/>The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries is a storytelling game of exploration and adventure inspired by the pulps. Playable in a single evening or over multiple sessions, it allows you and your friends to tell tales of harrowing danger, daring deeds, and furious action with freeform narration and pulse-pounding timed conflict resolution. No pre-game preparation is required, so grab your hat, your whip, and your .45 and get going!<br/></span><br/><br/>What's important to me is that the blurb stimulates my imagination.  If the blurb makes me think about an exciting adventure or a cool story then it's doing a great job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122316/#Comment_122316" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T08:39:53+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  8:39AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2008 8:59AM by Thunder_God.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The promise.

Rather, it picks out a highlight and it engages you in that highlight. The Dogs back cover blurb is wonderful because it is addressed to you, and it asks you a question. The Truth &amp; Justice blurb works because it feels like it's a moment in play - a brilliant moment that explains the theme of the game and involves "I" statements.<br/><br/>Good blurbs highlight stuff and make it immediately engaging. Another example that is wonderful is The Prince's Kingdom:<br/><br/><i>You are nine years old. Your brothers just got you a puppy for your birthday. The three of you are seeing the world from your very own boat. You are the sons of the King of Islandia!<br/><br/>And only you three can stop the war.</i><br/><br/>Seriously!<br/><br/>A good example of how to engage people in highlights without making AP-esque, I/You statement prose is Moments Frozen In Time, from Polaris. It's not the back cover, instead it's the first page. It gives you like 6-12 quick snippets, much like Wicked Age oracle elements, which give you a visceral and sensory understanding of the game. It is lush and engaging.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123153/#Comment_123153" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T16:57:39+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  4:57PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd also suggest airing your blurb here on Story-Games or the Forge or a blog or something for folks to comment on.
