class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                    The Unquiet Past (for Trollbabe)<br/><br/>Trolls tore down the halls of the pitiless elfs, and now Trolls skulk and flee before the flames and axes of the folk.  <br/><br/>Mostly slight tweaks in wording. <br/><br/>----<br/><br/><b>Diamonds</b><br/><br/>The boasting chief of a team of rock-quarriers.<br/><br/>The passage of a hunting party, dragging their slain and injured.<br/><br/>A young troll, grotesque and shaggy, sent to collect tribute.<br/><br/>The soul of a dead wizard, reborn in the body of a runt. <br/><br/>A gutted tower, home to many birds and a lone troll. <br/><br/>A maiden, the reincarnation of an ancient sage, remembering uncanny arts but forgetful of safeguards.<br/><br/>An apothecary, squint-eyed, with many uncanny potions.<br/><br/>An ancient snow elf queen, reawakened to fight for her lost realm.<br/><br/>A camp physician, her pockets full of salves and drugs.<br/><br/>The young, beautiful wife of an old troll-slayer. <br/><br/>A warrior, luckless and in poverty.<br/><br/>Two trolls, wedded to stone,  guardians of an enchanted glade.<br/><br/>A thick gold ring, torn by a powerful sage from a demon's ear.<br/><br/><b>Clubs</b><br/><br/>A girl with the soul of a troll, born inappropriately into a human body.<br/><br/>A witch elf, malicious and venomous, seeking vengeance.<br/><br/>The guardian of a tomb, a statue cast in silver with ruby eyes.<br/><br/>An ambitious petty-wizard, quick to take offense.<br/><br/>The awakening of three ancient and malignant trolls.<br/><br/>The bloodthirsty cousins of those drowned in the last moon. <br/><br/>A fallen temple, overgrown with moss and ivies, and its cult.<br/><br/>The son of a great tyrant, born crippled and denied his inheritance.<br/><br/>The favoured augur of a grim and austere captain.<br/><br/>The meeting by chance of old enemies, one less forgetful than the other.<br/><br/>A hermit priestess, practicing obscure deprivations.<br/><br/>A reader of omens and caster of auguries, with grim news.<br/><br/>The arrival by sea of honored emissaries from a wealthy land.<br/><br/><b>Spades</b><br/><br/>A waystation on a broad road, with a campsite and shrine.<br/><br/>A scholar and antiquarian, unmindful of danger.<br/><br/>The secret central shrine of an elven temple.<br/><br/>A new village built on the ruins of a forgotten people.<br/><br/>A place where white elves and trolls warred, the earth churned, upthrust, and charged with occult forces, and the wizard seeking its power.<br/><br/>The burglary of a jarl's circlet from his festhall.<br/><br/>A ruthless bully of a ship captain's son, with high ambitions.<br/><br/>The father of a child taken by creatures of the dark. <br/><br/>An unsavory treasure-seeker, with an honest map.<br/><br/>A trainer of dogs, bereft, mourning the death of his dearest charge.<br/><br/>A small room under the foundation, its doorway bricked shut, the prison of a dreadful and undying elf.<br/><br/>A wandering ship of uncanny origin, calling men to the sea.<br/><br/>A treasure seeker, following the whispers of a white elf spirit.<br/><br/><b>Spades</b><br/><br/>A slow-moving caravan with many wagons and travelers.<br/><br/>An elf who steals the knowledge of the dying.<br/><br/>A rough wolf-hunter, surly, filthy, and crude.<br/><br/>A market on the docks, full of sound and color.<br/><br/>A cruel and powerful young jarl.<br/><br/>The convocation of a ruin's many phantoms. <br/><br/>Instruments of torture, haunted by their victims.<br/><br/>A fearsome storm, with thunder and driving winds.<br/><br/>A woman's long blood-red hair, made into a talisman.<br/><br/>An ancient stone way marker, indicating an overgrown road, and the ghost buried there.<br/><br/>A knowledge-mad sp\xe6kona, delving into ancient secrets.<br/><br/>A golden armlet, still on the skeletal arm of its owner.<br/><br/>A wealthy merchant's son, refined and crafty.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment"
