In some ways this is similar to Steal Away Jordan which has details about slavery in the South, the historical setting and the daily life of such people.<br/><br/>What I do want to do is provide something that is seen as useful by the players. Not a massive amount of reference but something that gives the tone or feel of the situation.<br/><br/>So, my question is, if you're going to play this game, how much background information do you require?<br/><br/>And by this, I mean you personally, not some other hypothetical gamer. <br/><br/>If you know tons about prostitution in the Victorian East End, then please do say so. If you've seen From Hell and think that tells you enough, that's fine too. If you see this as a passion play for everywoman with no need for specific historical context, that's also good. If you want to know what the fourpenny touch is, the cost of bootlaces, life expectancy, the racial mix and the legal niceties of prostitution then that's of interest to me also.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275105/#Comment_275105" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T05:55:09+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  5:55AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've <i>read</i> From Hell and I think it was plenty.

Personally, I'd like to see an one-page rundown of short paragraphs illustrating various aspects of the victorian era, with a focus on the everyday lives of the inhabitants of Whitechapel. How long does one live? How's the medicine? What do they eat and drink? How's higiene? What are the moral standards? Social classes? What do people wear? How much do people earn and how much does stuff cost? Short, almost bullet-point facts about the tangible, day-to-day stuff that can immerse you into the flow of life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275107/#Comment_275107" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T05:57:17+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  5:57AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My preferences run towards the simulationist, so I would want a pretty good amount of information.

Dogs in the Vineyard is pretty light on setting information, but it does a good job of emphasizing what is important, so I would suggest looking there for inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275112/#Comment_275112" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T06:43:17+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  6:43AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A cheat sheet of era- and location-appropriate slang would probably go a long way.

What aspects are being played up? The stereotypical "pea-soup fog", an underlying horror, the triumphs of "modern science" (looking at Scotland Yard forensic practices of the time). Certainly make sure that the details provided in the book are facts that can be quickly incorporated into play, and that the balance of facts reflect the type of game as its intended to be played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275244/#Comment_275244" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T17:11:53+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  5:11PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2010 5:12PM by Ignotus.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bit of social context for prostitution in this era would be helpful - what kind of status do these women have?

But in this case I suppose at the very least I can mention Cockney Rhyming slang. 4d touch is, of course, a slang term used by prostitutes. It's the cost of their basic service and also that of one night in a doss house coffin. Victorian slang is plentiful so it will probably be a case of not going overboard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
