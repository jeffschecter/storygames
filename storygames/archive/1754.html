                    i am perplexed by the book.  <br/>
do you think i'd be able to use Capes to run a somewhat already outlined "plot"?  how do think it would handle a somewhat darker version of superheros, like one where they age and die?  <br/>
umm...this would be my first attempt at running a game, and i thought i'd have an easier go of it if i could take ideas from people more freely, and i guess to not have all(most of?) the pressure to entertain on my shoulders.  <br/>
if you don't think Capes would be that great of a fit for a more or less traditional game idea, a mystery, could you maybe point me to another game?  <br/>
i've played With Great Power and couldn't imagine running it as my first rpg, is Capes less complex?  <br/>

                            You absolutely CANNOT use Capes to run an outlined Plot.  The best you can do is to think up interesting bits to throw in if the opportunity arises.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can do a darker version of superheroes where they age and die.<br/>
<br/>
One of the great things about Capes is that since there's no GM there's no burden to entertain on just ONE person... it's shared.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a more traditional GM-player relationship, then you need a more traditional game system.<br/>
<br/>
Capes is probably on the same order of complexity as WGP, more or less.  If you want something SIMPLER than that... sheesh.  I don't know.  Both of them are pretty light systems as it is.  I'm not sure I can make a recommendation on that.                        </div>

<i>With Great Power...</i> is actually designed to do story arcs leading to a crisis, radical transformation of the heroes (which can be death), and then resolution. I've never played it so I don't know how well it works in practice, but it seems much better suited to your objective than <i>Capes</i>, which I have played, and which is all about pitching out cool ideas that the other people will run with and make story off of, and then taking their cool ideas and running with them in return: It's essentially uncontrollable by anyone participating. You can throw your favorite themes in there, but it's entirely up to your fellow-players whether they ignore them or emphasize them -- talking about the game you want to run BEFORE starting is always a good thing!<br><br><i>Sorcerer</i> is another game with a definite "count-down" mechanic, namely your character's Humanity score potentially falling to zero, but that's very dark and not easily translated to "age and die." Again, I've not played.<br><br>And otherwise I'm just blanking, honestly. "Indie" games almost never support a specific group agenda ("We grow old and die," "We save the Kingdom," "We fall in love") unless they're specifically hardwired for that agenda in the way the rules are designed.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            well, i didn't mean that as a specific agenda or goal "grow old and die", but i wanted that to be possible, that's all.  i just wanted to make it a point to address tone(modern superhero comics).  so no i didn't mean "grow old and die" as an end game, just as a color/tone thing.  <br>
what about some of the story games like story engine or theatrix or heck even primetime adventures?   <br>
do you know of a rpg that does mysteries well?   i've found that investigation in rpgs are equal parts foregone conclusions and gm fiat.<br>
it scares me that you say Capes is as difficult as WGP.  <br>
both games i own and now dread owning, 'cause i'll never play them.   <br/>
thanks for the input though.  it's really appreciated.  <br/>

                            Nate,<br/><br/>Fred is right in that Capes games are impossible to control in the traditional GM-Player sense.  You can guide the story in the direction you want but every other player at the table has equal power to resist or assist that guidance.  The key is to get them to buy into the direction you want so that they want to go that way too.  There are lots of way to do this and some of them are a little counter-intuitive until you get comfortable with how the game works in practice.<br/><br/>I disagree with Fred that Capes is as complex a game as WGP.  In terms of rules density, Capes is a simpler game.  There really aren't that many mechanics to learn and all the mechanics are fairly simple.  However, in application the game can become very complex.  It's like Diplomacy (if you are familiar with that game) in that there are a few simple rules but when you get into the game and start applying them the situations can become complex.  In that sense, Capes is probably more complex than WGP.<br/><br/>Frankly, I've played both games and neither of them are very complicated.  Capes can be difficult to figure out from simply reading the book if you've never played an RPG similar to it.  I actually had to sit down with someone who knew what they were doing and play a session before I grokked the rules but once I did that I almost didn't need the rules except as a refresher.  Playing a scene or two is all it really takes to "get" the game.  Don't despair.                        </div>

                            Capes is also fairly playable, for the purposes of learning the rules, via IRC or skype.  You need a communal place to keep track of conflicts, etc. which can be done with a Wiki or with Google Documents.<br/>

                            yeah, i'm from PA and Mike and Kat ran WGP for a group of friends, and i couldn't imagine running it as my first attempt.  i like alot of things about the game, but i think it needs to be pared down, at least for my tastes.  the card play seemed a bit pointless in the beginning, and i'm not sure i like how stakes play out, maybe i'm just not used to them, but they seem awfully subjective.  there are just some approaches that the game takes that i don't 100% agree with.  <br>
i'd love to try capes in chat sometime.<br>

                            Wow.  You get sick for a few hours, and everyone makes you ... uh ... superfluous.<br/><br/>At a glance, I believe I endorse all of the advice given here.<br/><br/>Now if you really want to make things happen, though, there's a mechanism I don't think people have pointed out to you:  Events.<br/><br/>Most of the time, people play Goals ("Doctor Doom defeats the Fantastic Four!") because they're very hard to veto and therefore very easy to write.  But then, maybe you get the plot-element you wanted (the defeat) and maybe you don't.<br/><br/>If you want to get at least Stan Lee levels of plotting you can do that by playing predominantly Events.  It means you need to think harder.  Like, for instance, in most groups you're not going to get away with "Event:  Doctor Doom defeats the Fantastic Four" but you almost certainly <b>could</b> get away with "Event:  Doctor Doom receives iron-clad evidence that the Fantastic Four has been defeated."<br/><br/>Playing an event like that lets you say "Hey, I'd really like to at least have a lushly described moment where Doom and the audience are convinced of the Fantastic Four's defeat.  If you guys win the conflict then, yeah, it was all a clever deception on Reed's part, because he's hugely smart that way.  That's cool (though I'll fight to get the <i>genuine</i> defeat).  As long as I get that moment then I'll be okay either way."                        </div>

                            This is a question only a dummy would ask. I have Capes Lite, I'm looking it over in preparation for running it, it says when I write a card with a Goal, I put one die for my Persona and one die for the "other side". I am assuming that anyone that wants that Goal to not take place - no matter what they want to have happen - is on the "other side". Say, a soft-hearted villain has "Obtain information from hostage" as a goal, a nasty villain who wants to kill the hostages outright might oppose that goal, or a hostage that believes the villain will let him live (or has a Goal out that says 'Be released from terrorists') could support that goal?                        </div>

                            JD:  For a Capes-Lite interpretation?  Yeah.  Anybody who wants to outright oppose the goal should be on the other side.<br/><br/>For more complexity?  Sometimes in the full game, people get into debates that aren't as simple as "Do we get information from the hostage or not?"  You get people saying "No!  <b>You</b> won't get information from him!  It is we who will learn the secret of the Cyclical Rhombus!" and then they end up with three (or more) sides ... "The Kamikazistani's get the information" and "The CIA gets the information" and "Nobody gets the information" and things just go bug-house crazy :-)                        </div>

                            does it have to be one or the other?  <br/>
maybe overcoming my uncomfortableness more so?  <br/>
i guess i want the best of both worlds, the "something to fall back on" with a pre- planned situation/plot elements, and not having the greater responsibility of being the "sole conductor of story".  <br/>
i think a game i have yet to play may not be the best to run for my first time.  why have i never said this about checkers/chess?  <br/>

                            Nate - Capes is an awesome game.  But it's a little intimidating, because it's so counter-intuitive; I, for one, couldn't learn it simply by reading the rules, and had to figure things out through play.  (May just be how I learn things.)<br/>
<br/>
I think you might want Primetime Adventures, since it's very simple to learn, it's a low GM burden, it could do superheroes pretty easily ("Issue: losing powers with old age") and you still get to harvest your friends for plot ideas.  But don't give up on Capes, because Capes is the most fun RPG I've played, once I got over the learning curve.  I can't wait to play it again.<br/>
<br/>
Also: GM'ing ain't nothin' but a thang.  There's no need to stress it.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nate</cite>does it have to be one or the other?</blockquote>No, there's no reason it has to be one or the other.  I'm just thinking that playing a game of Capes doesn't really prepare you to (for instance) Produce a game of PTA.  It's an entirely different sort of mind-set, and so I figure that if you're looking to get comfortable with GMing then Capes may not be your bag.  Even if you got real comfortable with Capes (which, y'know, would be great) then you'd have to go through a whole second learning curve to get comfortable with being the central Johnny-on-the-spot that usually goes along with the GM-role.<br><br>Get my meaning?                        </br></br></div>

                            You want to go relatively traditional in terms of your GM influence on plot and such?  Get Truth &amp; Justice.<br/><br/>You want stuff that grows solely out of the characters themselves?  I believe Capes and WGP are your thang.                        </div>

                            yeah, Truth and Justice has been on my "to get" list for awhile.  is the copy nice?  b+w or color?  anyone know?  and would it do gritter superpowers justice, like say Wildcards or Watchmen?  <br/>
i'd still like to try Capes over the inter-web sometime.  <br/>
coulda compare and contrast a little on "Truth and Justice vs. PTA"?   differences, simularities?<br/>
hey, thanks for all the comments, by the way.<br/>

                            Thanks for the tip, I ran Capes Lite at the con and there were a few little bumps but everyone was into it and it went very smoothly. Everyone had a great time and the undisputed winner of the cardstock click-and-locks was someone who was primarily a D&amp;D player.                        </div>
