I've toyed around with other styles in the past, and I keep coming back to that style of gameplay being the most satisfying.<br/><br/>There are certain limitations to this gameplay, the main being that players often don't know what information they can get out of me as the GM. They get stuck, not thinking to ask for more information, not knowing what questions to ask, or not understanding that I'm happy to dump loads of knowledge on them. I'm formulating a list of questions in the vein of read a sitch that are available for players to ask. The goal is to prompt the GM for more details so that he can provide more information for the players without giving the game away. <br/><br/>\u2022 What is unusual or noteworthy about this character? (<i>It seems peculiar that a human would be employed by drow. As far as you know, the drow hate humans and view them as lessers.</i>)<br/><br/>\u2022 What do this character's mannerisms reveal about his mood? (<i>The elf paces back and forth as you speak with him, occasionally wringing his hands. He's on edge about something.</i>)<br/><br/>\u2022 What does this character's appearance tell me about his history? (<i>The heavy blacksmith's apron is a size too large for a lad of his age. It must have been handed down from someone else. His father, maybe, or a mentor.</i>)<br/><br/>What other questions might I ask, and/or how might I change the phrasing on these questions or make the process more engaging?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471576/#Comment_471576" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-09T22:01:29+00:00" title="April  9, 2018 10:01PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the particular questions you've listed here... is there any reason you can't just tell that to the players right away?

If you're describing a scene, you're likely underspecifying a lot that would be obvious if the players were actually there in real life.  This is the stuff you've got to give them without asking, otherwise the players are going to be frustrated. All the sight, smells, and sounds...things that a normal person would be aware of (including things that seem odd, like your human working for a drow master), you've got to tell the players before they ask or before they dream up some wacky plan that is bound to fail because an important part of the environment or interaction is underspecified.  Don't wait for them to ask about something that a normal person in that give situation would notice immediately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471595/#Comment_471595" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-10T09:33:24+00:00" title="April 10, 2018  9:33AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I say you've got to do this or that, you really don't have to do it, but I feel like it is being unfair to the players if you don't.
