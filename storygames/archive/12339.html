They tend to be more traditional gamers, but they\u2019ve all played and enjoyed story games such as Lacuna, 3:16, and others.<br/><br/>As preparation for the game I read through the rules, drew up a dungeon (an abandoned big box store similar to IKEA that had been corrupted by weird energies), and printed off six class handbooks, since they\u2019re long and there was no way I was going to have the players write all that out.<br/><br/>As the game started, the players grabbed classes, and we had a sawbones, a shootist, a stringman, and a reader. I went through the rules, and the players were immediately overwhelmed by the amount of abilities and what they all did. Since we were somewhat pressed for time, everyone rolled up their characters, I did a brief introduction in the office, and decided to get on with the games, after handing out a copy of the wound track and the experience track to everyone. <br/><br/>The mission started as the employees, as well as three interns, approached a huge parking lot full of rusted cars. After walking through the lot for a while, they spotted three lions, which I figured would be a well-enough surreal start to the adventure to emphasize the strange nature of the world. <br/><br/>Combat got off to a rough start. People were confused on both the way dice rolls worked, how bonuses worked, and how the turn order went, and two players thought it was very unclear as to what they could do on their turn. After figuring things out, it turned out one of the lions went first, and it rushed the sawbones, immediately making him go critical thanks to a pair of lucky rolls. The shootist bloodily killed one of the lions, and the reader helped save the sawbone\u2019s life as the stringman and shootist finished off the other lions. <br/><br/>Unfortunately due to some real life circumstances, the player of the stringman had to leave early (we were running this after another game which had gone short, so it wasn\u2019t like he just showed up and immediately left). The shootist\u2019s player decided this would be a great time for the \u201cpurposefully kill an ally\u201d achievement, which pissed off the stringman\u2019s player, who liked his character. <br/><br/>At this point, things started to go downhill. The player of the sawbones, discontent thanks to being taken down immediately and after realizing he lacked many combat capabilities, and the player of the shootist, just because he\u2019s generally like that, decided to just try and \u201cgame the system\u201d by getting as many achievements as possible without actually doing anything. <br/><br/>Cue a train of purposefully severing and reattaching limbs, poisoning each other, electrocuting each other, sneak attacking interns, and other such ridiculousness. I figured this was taking a while, and used the threat I had built up from all this dicking around to bring the threat of a monster, a horrible giant nemian lion mutated by foul forces to bear against the players. <br/><br/>This fight was short, as the sawbones hid, rolled well, and automatically knocked the monster out with anesthesia before it got a chance to do much of anything other than harrow the players from its appearance, something they were excited to have happen rather than afraid of, thanks to the achievement system of experience. I have to say it was the first time I\u2019ve seen players happy to have their characters panic and run away from a monster. <br/><br/>Anyways, they spent some more time dicking around in the parking lot, racking up even more achievements through stupid and admittedly somewhat clever ways. Eventually, they went into the dungeon. Entering it, it appeared to be a massive, burnt out retail store. Immediately, the shootist pushes the reader up an escalator (which was trapped to only allow people to go up), leading him into a food court with some pythons in it. <br/><br/>Trapped alone and after failing a series of rolls to escape and unable to fight the pythons effectively, the reader was killed by a lucky damage roll on the \u201cwhen animals attack\u201d chart. The two remaining players (and no remaining interns, all of which fell to the achievement-whoring schemes of the players), hung around in the first room of the dungeon for a while, I sent a monster to chase them, and they just waited until the company van came around to pick them up; devoid entirely of treasure and having explored a single room of the vast complex.<br/><br/>Returning to MADcorp headquarters with an utterly and completely failed mission, the players excitedly totaled their experience (counting the points for being blamed, written up, violating company policy, and keeping their single priceless item, the monster lion\u2019s hide, for themselves) they tallied 37 experience for the shootist, and 32 for the sawbones, with both other characters dead.<br/><br/>The game took a little over an hour and a half. Talking with the players after, they had the following to say:<br/><br/>The player of the shootist disliked the way dice were rolled and thought the modifiers were confusing. He also disliked the way the turn system worked, stating it was too vague on what he could do in a turn (which may have been poor explanation on my part). He liked the setting and classes a lot though.<br/><br/>The player of the sawbones didn\u2019t like his class, saying it was far too focused on one thing. He, and the other players, agreed that the wound system is far too random. Going from perfectly fine to dying in one round thanks to a lucky roll is no fun, and with the way the system is setup that\u2019s all too likely to happen. Also, having to look up each hit on one of many charts, while a cool idea is pretty time consuming and takes away from the frantic feel of combat. <br/><br/>The player of the reader thought his character was underpowered, requiring a round of \u201ctouching a mind\u201d before being able to use his powers, compared to the shootist who dealt far more damage far more times and was, as we all agreed, clearly overpowered compared to everyone else. He was also pretty resentful over having been killed so easily, and pointed out that having an achievement for \u201cpurposefully (or even accidentally) killing a teammate\u201d is a pretty lame thing to try and encourage. <br/><br/>Personally, I agree, as I\u2019ve seen that no matter the reasons in character, PvP can be very bad out of game unless it\u2019s something like paranoia where it\u2019s stated clearly and up front that you will get killed by teammates and not to get too attached to your character. <br/><br/>My thoughts overall are that the game is a bit all over the place. The setting is good, and the idea of dungeon horror with some comedy thrown in is a very solid one. However, with monsters being strange, powerful, alien things, I was sort of at a loss of what to populate the dungeon with. It seems like animals, people (which are explicitly stated to be rare sights in dungeons), and traps can only go so far; and since it IS a dungeon, just filling rooms with scenery and nothing seems kind of lame. <br/><br/>The rules are, in my opinion, rather complex. You have separate things that happen for each of a wide variety of conditions that only occur at certain times, all requiring a lot of looking things up in the book. For example, poison, hunger, infection, and stress disorders could all be building up all the time, but each requires separate rules. The danger mechanic building up over time was very cool, and seemed like an excellent pacing mechanic, easily one of my favorite parts of the games aside from the classes and setting. Again, the whole checking rolls against charts thing was a big slow-down.<br/><br/>Class-wise, although you state you didn\u2019t try for balance, I would maybe look in to trying for at least some. For example, in our game the shootist absolutely dominated combat to the point of making the other players visibly bored, while the reader struggled to inflict even minimal damage. The classes and their abilities are diverse and complex enough that picking up a new character isn\u2019t exactly the easiest thing in the world, so balancing by virtue of people migrating to the best classes over time seems like it might be challenging.<br/><br/>Buddy scores didn\u2019t really come up, just by virtue of the players not happening on classes that referenced each other for score mods, although it seemed like a pretty solid mechanic.<br/><br/>The experience mechanic, as I described earlier, ended up with the players doing stupid things to whore for points, which in my opinion sort of detracted from the game. I could have vetoed them as GM, but they seemed to enjoy it, and I couldn\u2019t think of an in-game reason to do so. If I were to use the charts again, I would hide them from the players so they don\u2019t try to do stuff just to get the experience and instead would just happen into it (although this would add another layer of bookkeeping). <br/><br/>Overall, I\u2019m not sure how good of a playtest this was since it sort of fell into complete chaos fairly soon after starting. The random lethality and banality of corporate dungeoneering was captured to an extent, but it certainly didn\u2019t go the way I pictured it. In the end I think the game could use some polishing and maybe I could use some more cooperative players.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277123/#Comment_277123" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T12:43:01+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 12:43PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, cool, I'll be back with a more thought-out response, but here's some things to occur to me off the top of my head.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>ICombat got off to a rough start.

That's an important thing. They need to be worried about leveling up the company, and avoiding getting their budget cut from repeatedly failing jobs. I'm guessing that the players aren't anticipating a long-term game, and thus aren't concerned about this stuff. That's really important, because it changes the optimal strategies, and thus certain important bits of the game don't get tested. Even if you guys aren't going to play for multiple quarters, the players have to at least <i>pretend</i> they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277131/#Comment_277131" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T13:19:34+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  1:19PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2010 1:33PM by whiteknife.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I see a lot of the points you're making. I do think a lot of the issues came from the players not really approaching it seriously or in any long-term sense after about the first half of the game. Similarly, I think that the combat imbalance did likely come from class choice as well as the focus on combat as opposed to exploration. Although if the game is supposed to be 80-90% non-combat then that should be pointed out more clearly in the text- when I think "dungeon" I think 80-90% <i>combat</i>, not the other way around. In fact, my approaching it more like a D&amp;D game and less like, say, a more horror-type game is probably where a lot of the issues I had came from, that and the players not being as cooperative as I'd have liked them to be. They tend to only really jive well with really simple and/or very meticulously balanced games. <br/><br/>Overall though, I like the premise of the game a lot, and while the test could have gone better, I think that the core ideas are pretty sound. In the future I'd know to approach the game a lot less like an action/combat dungeon slasher and more like an investigative/explorative horror type game.<br/><br/>Oh, as for the achievements they got, mostly it was the various injury types ones. I think they got literally every "take damage of [X] type" and "watch someone crack/explode/get a limb amputated" just by beating the living shit out of each other (and the interns) and waiting around afterwords to heal. I don't imagine this to be a viable long-term strategy, but it is a possibility if you have players in the (im?)proper mindset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277249/#Comment_277249" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T07:09:55+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  7:09AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An issue I had with the game (well, one of several) when I tried to run it (AP forthcoming when I finish that adventure) is that it's absolutelly not clear what the players are supposed to identify with. The employees? Well, they're cool and everything, but in the end, they're just expendable resources - you lose them, you get more, no biggy. The company? Well, it gives you cash* and stuff, but it's also very clearly pegged as a source of adversity, so why would you want to care about it's long-term success?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy players instantly took to the game, but as far as I can tell, they took to the part where "you're cool people exploring a dungeon" and not the "you're the expendable mooks that are getting exploited for profits" part.

From a pure fiction/economy standpoint, why are any of these people working for MADCorp? If a company can't pay their wages without them getting enough crap to sell for the company to get the monies to pay their wages, these people are obviously better off being self-employed and selling their wares from a street corner.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, there's stuff that a company can offer - knowledge of jobs that can be undertaken, varying levels of intelligence on the dungeon, discounts on mass purchase of weaponry, fringe benefits like your own limo driver, champagne and a daily pedicure... But none of the stuff that gives you a grip on "this is a *job* that you're doing" is there.

He was more pissed about it than anything, and he's usually pretty cool about character death. This probably had a lot to do with the particular death being a bit of a PvP thing, but I think that the relative complexity and cool/unique-ness of the characters may also make it so you get more attached to them, and thus more adverse to losing them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277358/#Comment_277358" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T13:50:22+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  1:50PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They should identify with the employees but, y'know, not too strongly.

You get screentime by doing what other people just can't do (note: this can be an issue, too, if everyone on the table miraculously rolls up the same character type). The main thing about the classes is that they have a core theme about them and pretty much rock at everything that has to do with it. So it's not about balance as in balance between classes... But it CAN be about making sure a character class really does rock at things that belong to its core theme (Telekinesis for Reader).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut! If I'm right about that, there are still some issues with this. Killers&amp;Muscle; will usually get something to kill or muscle, so they're not that much of an issue. But, a lot of Specialists and some Occult weirdos have rather narrow, er, areas of application - a Hustler in a dungeon with no people in it would get time in the sun only at the end of the dungeon, a Cooler in a place without magic would get none at all, a Snake Eater not-outdoors would be somewhat hampered, and a Sawbones would not be that much fun when people just don't get hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nA way to do get around this is to make sure that every character the players have a chance of strutting their stuff (well, the Cooler is here so I guess I'll add in a little magic leak right there...) while designing the dungeon or ad-libbing something in just to fit the party composition. But that is pretty much meh and just doesn't jive well with the spirit of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way is to give the players a list of possible jobs and let them pick!  I did this and it was pretty fun - they had a choice between City Park, Floor 13 of a local ritzy hotel, and a Forsaken Fireworks Factory. They first decided to go to either to the Fireworks Factory or Floor 13 (on the insistence of the Gloomdoll, for obvious reasons), but then we had the local Arko roll to see what he knew about each, and he busted for each roll except for City Park, so that's where they went (and then the game did not happen because a player had to leave). Basically... When the options the players get are so random, I think it's a good idea to give them a strategic layer of choice - specifically, the choice of the arena they will test their skills in. But for that, you need more dungeons and it is not nothing to get a dungeon ready for the game...

Even if they don't *play* more than one at a time, it's a really good idea for players to have a pool of guys that they pick from from job to job. If somebody's figured out how to make his Gloomdoll do everything, then, fine, he could bring him on every job. But a guy who's been playing a Bruiser should be able to see that the next job is in a hospital/morgue, and be like, "Um, yeah, ok, I'm bringing a Gloomdoll this time."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite>This game could really benefit from a dungeon database since they don't have to be level appropriate.</blockquote>\nTrue dat.

There was plenty of other stuff that IS useful to me in there.<br><br>Mike,<br>Have you played Sorcerer? Or Burning Wheel or the Rustbelt? I'm asking because, in these sorts of games, "screen-time" is primarily (like, 90%) about being a protagonist. But none of these games guarantee you protagonism, unlike certain other games. They leave it up to you. YOU have to DO it. They won't hold your hand, y'know? So you can come out of one of these games without having done much just because you didn't step up to the plate.<br><br>MADcorp is like that. You're not granted screen-time, you <i>earn</i> it. It's like, carpe diem, biotch.

It's about being able to participate the same amount in the game as the other players. Which inflects on protagonism, but isn't quite the whole deal. But sure, if you want to grand-stand to get everyone to pay attention to you because your character can't play right now - that's fine.
