                    So this weekend I participated in a weekend LARP.  It is a group I have larped with more or less annually.  It's usually a good time especially since it's in the PA mountains and I could bring my dogs to the wilderness with me.<br/><br/>The game always has a homebrew changeling aspect to it.  This year it was about pirates in the Caribbean, invited by a local governor whose offering amnesty at a high price.<br/><br/>Here's the point:<br/>There was a lot of emphasis put on the GM's characters (where I thought this could tie into many of the games we talk about here).  Now in a LARP there is an enormous amount of player power since there is no real narrative involved in the process.  The narrative is replaced by direct conversations and direction (go over there and talk to so-and-so).<br/><br/>Brief plot situation: One character needed a few items scattered amongst the crews to open a gate to Arcadia (which has been closed).  Many PCs didn't even know about the gate or it's possibility (I guessed it before we played but that was based on games I have played with these folk before).  <br/><br/>The main conflict was between three GMs-run-characters (unbeknownst to anyone in the game).   One was manipulating another and the third was a foil to the other two.  They obviously worked out the ending in what one NPC would react to another.  And in the end the main bad guy triumphed over all.  As it turned out almost no one knew the effects of what was going on and I felt a sense of "aren't we clever, I manipulated you all in my ploy for power."<br/><br/>I thought this was a bit dis-satisfying but I remained silent unless asked for criticism.  So I ask you, does this sound like a viable means to unviel plot?  What would you have changed?  Sure, I know this is all pretty vague but I didn't see going into details as crucial for the crux of the discussion.  If you really want to know details let me know and I can elucidate.<br/><br/>Personally my thought was that the GM's characters should have been PCs and not NPCs.  I think the players needed to be more involved.  I think this game would have had a far greater impact if moe information was given out and if secrets were doled out to the players to be discovered by the characters.  However, I am uncertain how this would be achieved in a LARP situation where the reveal seems to drive players a little more than tabletop.<br/><br/>It is akin to a game of Luke's <i>Inheritance</i> (Luke's games tend to be very LARPish) Fred and I played and Fred was bummed that the coolest things going on were in his head  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>- Don                </div>

The main powerplay happening between GM characters sounds like something that could make the LARP dull for "normal" players, unless it's a kind of powerplay where the said characters would extensively use player characters as pawns with their own agendas and goals. Something where the GM characters would either be present for a very short time or not at all (so player characters would act as their agents in the field). A LARP where everything (major) is set around NPC characters might force the players to be more of an audience than active participants in what happens. Was this what happened? Did the NPC characters powerplay touch normal characters and involve them?                        </div>

                            Yes and no.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like the GMs were playing by themselves.  They were trying to instigate action through the players.  However they could have put that power in the hands of the players, no?  Your right, if it were a "start them on their way and let them go" then it would have been plot building.  I guess my concern was that they were too involved.  Especially in the end when NPCs drive the endings - gates opening, etc.  Apparently there wasn't anyone around other than the ntwo GMs during the main NPCs final triumph.  She claimed "I win!" to the other GM that was there.                        </div>

                            YES! IT'S A LARP THREAD!<br/><br/>Don, I really agree with your take on the GM characters. If I had a penny for every LARP game I'd played where the plot involved NPCs (i.e. GM characters), I'd be rich. GMs often make the mistake of thinking that the players will get involved in a conflict between NPCs, but they're almost always wrong.<br/><br/>LARP plots are very difficult. You can see why the GMs want to nail down the plot, to know pretty much how it'll run during the game. But it can make for a very unsatisfying game.<br/><br/>Could you tell us a bit more about the game? Do the players mostly know each other? What was the system? How long did the game last? How many players?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Hey Graham,<br/><br/>Well, what would you like to know about the game.  I tried to keep it brief since a wise friend once said "if it's more than 1/2 page forget it.  I need to be able to read it and respond well within my lunch hour."  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As for your other questions:<br/>The system is a simplified version of Mind's Eye Theatre.  It worked very well.  You have three stats (brawn, brains and moxie) and skills.  Those skills added to te stats.  This is basically a tei breaker in RPS.<br/><br/>The game was just a weekend (mostly Saturday).  We do these annual events and all meet on a friend's land north of the Poconos.<br/><br/>There were about 15 players.<br/><br/>All of these people are close friends or friends of friends.  I was happy to hear that one of the folk I brought with me was equally dissatified.  Of course I shut my mouth about such things 'cause I want to be invited again <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Even a LARP that had some weaknesses is still usually better than the crap I see month to month in other venues <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Well, in my experience running several weekend LARPs (after having played in dozens before-hand) I will tell you two things:<br/><br/>First:  It is absolutely imperative that the players be given the keys to the kingdom, plot-wise.  If the NPCs have a terrible scheme that they wish to hatch then that terrible scheme must <b>absolutely require</b> the assistance of as many PCs as they can possibly manage, and must hinge completely upon the actions and choices of at least a few.  People can smell where they aren't necessary with freakish accuracy, and will wander away from a dramatic scene in progress when they figure out that there's not going to be any place for them.
<blockquote>I was NPCing at a diplomatic treaty game.  Two sides were deciding the fate of a little scrap of land.  I was supposed to be a monkey-wrench:  a native of the little scrap, with legitimate claims but no power <i>at all</i> to offer the PCs anything that would make them take me seriously.  So I asked the GM "Hey ... how convincing do you want me to be?  Is there going to be trouble if every single PC sides with me?"  She looked at me, rolled her eyes and said "Just be as convincing as you can Tony, and let me worry about the story."  I still think that the coalition we formed (yes, <i>every single PC</i> eventually sided with me, leaving the powerful, story-centric NPCs out in the cold) would have made for a great story ... but instead the GM had me spontaneously develop a severe case of "dead by fiat" and told everyone to quit jacking around and get back to power politics.</blockquote>
Second:  The PCs are on crack.  They will do absolutely, monumentally, unbelievably STUPID things with no logic and no remorse.  As a group they cannot be trusted to put together even the simplest of ideas into a coherent plan or story.
<blockquote>My friend Anthony made this awesome spider costume that had him (alone) wielding eight scything, swinging, rebounding boffer weapons.  He was an avatar of death.  The PCs got wind of him before the game, and did <b>not</b> want to take him on, even at 40-to-1 odds.  We were gleeful.  We placed the McGuffin in the spider's cave and said "Hey, the spider sleeps at night ... and on sundown at saturday the world will be destroyed if you don't have the McGuffin.  If you guys get your act together and get out there sometime friday night then you'll never have to face him ... otherwise you're gonna have to fight."  They didn't get out there friday.  By mid-day saturday they knew the score, and were kicking themselves.  But none of them moved toward the cave.  I sent someone out to ask what their plan was.  The plan, they said, was to wait until nightfall, when the spider would be asleep.  I sent my courier back out.  He discovered that, yes, they knew that the world was ending at sundown.  They felt strongly that their best shot was to wait until full dark, get the item, then run back to camp <i>really fast</i> in hopes of getting there before the sun went down.</blockquote>
So there you've got the dilemma:  In order to make a game work properly the GMs need to put the power into the hands of the PCs.  But, I kid you not, the PCs make some really mind-bogglingly bone-headed decisions.  It is impossible to fool-proof a story, no matter how simple, from such ingenious fools.  So, honestly, I think there's always going to be a balancing act.  You put <i>enough</i> power into the hands of the PCs, but keep some active, driving NPCs in the mix to provide a structure around which PC action can gel.<br/><br/>Now it sounds as if your GMs went <i>way the hell over</i> on one end of that spectrum, and ran a pretty questionable game as a result.  But I gotta tell you, I've got a world of sympathy for them.                        </div>

I've witnessed the same thing for several times (to be honest, a lot of the early LARP's I've been playing or writing, had quite a strong NPC guidance - it's the easy way to drive things forward), and while it sometimes works out, the NPC's can't usually involve player characters enough. How wrecking that is for the whole experience depens on how central NPC conflict is and how easy it is for players to, well, ignore it.<br/><br/>Another variation of the theme are central player characters in campaigns. For example, when a player character becomes a Prince of the town in Vampire, the amount of "guidance" from GM's usually increase, sometimes to the point where the player is actually playing a character turned into a NPC.<br/><br/>Giving no guidance is not an answer, though, if the LARP has to follow some kind of plot and there has to be some kind of cool scene initiated or led by some characters. This often leads to the need to guide player characters during the actual playing which is, kindly put, not the best solution ("Here's what your character wants to do.").<br/><br/>There are some methods which we use to circumvent the problem; empowering players and either giving guidance in a form they don't mind and which leaves a lot of room for interpretation, or inserting some kind of structure for the game beforehand. Both involve pre-written characters and some pre-written structuring for the LARP.<br/><br/>Were the characters in this game pre-written or made by the players, BTW?                        </div>

I hear you, Tony and I think your right on target.  before the LARP I kept hearing the GMs say "oh, and we have a really tight plot so we have to know this and that about what the players are doing."  I cringed everytime I heard it.  That saying about the plans meeting the enemy goes fourfold when LARP players are involved.  In my decades of LARPing experience (on both sides of the fence) tells me that GMs should write the plot into the characters backgrounds then step back and watch the fireworks.  <br/><br/>I have always found regular events help to pace a story out (handing out timed info or having "plot hooks" stumble in with knives in their back).  But that doesn't guarentee they will nibble.                        </div>

They made all the characters.  If it were the other way (not an idea I have ever been fond of as a GM) then I would understand the heavier hand in NPC drive.  Do either of you think the main NPCs should have been players?  Maybe even one's "in the know?"<br/><br/>You and Tony make some good points that really kinda equate to the same trial and error a GM faces when running games for a group.  I am a litle concerned because they want to run this at Origins next year [also why I am not giving too many details <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ].  I see how the game went with a group of people they know and play with regularly.  I wonder what the outcome will be in an environment of strangers.                        </div>

I was also playing in the same game eruditus is talking about.  We had pre-written characters which gave us specific guidance.  But when it came down to game play, I felt I was being ignored by GMs when I was exploring alternate methods of getting my goal.  <br/><br/>I'll give you an example of what I encountered.  My character was obsessed with wringing some information from the spirit of her dead mother (which I had trapped on my person).  My character sheet talked about getting to the Fountain of Youth, which I was certain was in the area, and my needing a dead body to hold her soul.  I was approached by a GM's NPC who said she could help me get what I wanted with her gypsy magic.  I made note of various PCs who I could bump off with reason.<br/><br/>But then I met a PC who apparently had the power to talk to spirits, and yet another PC turned out to have this rockin' power of persuasion.  So when friendly PCs came to me saying how unfriendly PCs (driven by rumors from NPCs) were saying I was about to do some great evil I said "Well, I guess I could try Plan B".  I now focused my attention on completing my goal using the skills of the PCs around me instead of the skills of the gypsy NPC.<br/><br/>Suddenly reaching my goal seemed much much harder than if I had just taken the gypsy woman's help.  <br/><br/>In the end I did not make my goal and my mother's spirit was released before I could speak to it.

                            I have a theory about LARPs.  It's something I have been saying for years and the idea constantly faces resistance.<br/><br/>In my opinion <b>a LARP is simply chatting in character</b>.  To take that further it's the responsibility of all involved to find engaing topics to chat about (or instigate topics) but ultimately there is nothing more to it.  Now some LARP types are different, particularly when you get into boffer LARPs with mad props and NPC mooks you can accomplish a little more.  However I don't think any LARP should just be one scene after another of action.  This is not a cinematic medium like tabletop can be.  GM narraration should be kept to a minimium.  Players should suss out their own drama and try to attain their goals socially - and consequences for acting in an asocial manner should be as harsh as they are in the real world. <br/><br/>All the information the characters need should be in their backgrounds, doled out throughout the game through NPCs or added background or found in well placed props.  That information should lead them to their social goals.<br/><br/>With some <i>very difficult and dynamic exceptions</i> a LARP should be driven by social goals.  How do I get info from this person?  How do I convince them of an action?  How do I rally their support?  How do I get others to rally against them?  Once they have the social goals then there should be some sort of measurement for their success in game (a vote off the island, appointment of a new post, a lynching, a tbale full of gathered components).  And I think most importantly I think people should be talking about it.  We should be talking about what we should wear, what we should be bringing, how we should or shouldn't act and commenting on how others act.  In my opinion that is the heartbeat of a LARP.<br/><br/>Too often I see games where the GMs stand amidst a group of LARPers and narrate what they see and what situation they are in then ask the players to elucidate on what their PCs are doing.  Whispered meeting happen as players corner GMs with their laundry lists of secret actions and how they are interacting with the outside world to get their goals met.  Players wander off in hiding until the need for what they have stolen has passed yet wander around "out of game" chatting with their compatriots.  It is often forgotten that what makes a LARP is not the cool things you accomplished but the conversations you had in your persuit.<br/><br/>If players and GMs keep this in mind I think a significant amount of frustration can be avoided.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>They made all the characters.

If the characters were pre-created then definately the NPC's should have been player characters. I can't really think a single reason why they couldn't have been, except perhaps the want for plot control (which is a misplaced want at best).
<blockquote>I have a theory about LARPs.</blockquote>
I very much agree, with some exception or extensions.<br/><br/>Aside from being a very social (as in interacting, chatting) medium, LARPs are also a physical medium. You experience things through your body, as the character is not only something you imagine, but also something that you are. Furthermore, the physical dimension also adds to the social one; you communicate with body language, with clothes, with all kinds of visual (and other) stuff.<br/><br/>LARPs are also medium of doing; you can move, you can touch, eat, drink, do stuff, immerse into the surroundings. This enchances the experience, makes it more real. A lot of LARPs focuse on "just" chatting, which is good, but can be expanded.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd love to do some heavy-adrenaline special squad action.                        </div>

Whoa, there. The organisers actually gave a negative prize because a character (player) did not met some goal they had set for it? For the life of me, I can't understand. It's wrong on several levels, the least being:<br/><br/>Providing linear plot with a GM NPC that can solve it.<br/>Punishing the player for coming up with a creative solution that the GM's probably had not anticipated (and explicitly punishing the player, not the character, after the game).<br/>Punishing the player for not meeting a goal provided by the GM's, but instead focusing on roleplaying (a loaded term, this, I know) and interaction with other characters.<br/><br/>I don't really have anything kind to say about handing out a negative prize (even if it's handed out in ha-ha-ha -style). Other things could be considered to be design choices and/or errors and whatnot, but that is just a... Clusterfuck. Pardon my French.<br/><br/>That aside, your experience sounded like a very good one, sans the after game.                        </div>

I completely agree with this.  The best LARP I was ever in was a small Murder Mystery event for about 10 people.  The organizer rented a refurbished train car and catered a dinner for the participants.  All the action took place on the train so having an actual train car to 'play' in made remarkable positive impact on the game. We had meals and drinks to discuss over, cubbyholes in which to hide murder weapons, windows to 'spot' things out of, etc.  Our physical surroundings added to the atmosphere and thus the ability of the players to immerse themselves even more into their characters.

I'd like to - I just need to figure a way to frame my feedback in such a way as that I'm not coming across as too critical.  All in all I had a good time at the game, there were a lot of positive aspects and some awesome role-playing.  I just felt a bit railroaded by GMs who felt their particular stories were more important than my having a good time in story I was helping to create.                        </div>

I assume that the emphasis on "just" is meaningful.  How about "action chatting!"  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  If we're going to move this to another thread I am hesitant to go much further.<br/><br/>I appreciate everyone's clarity.  It has helped a lot.  I don't see a good way to open up a dialogue with the GMs on this.  I have a tendancy to have a big mouth about such things and I feel they may take it as my ego getting in the way.<br/><br/>EDIT: maybe I will just let this thread get buried and send them a link to the great thread Merten started <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Is that too passive-aggressive?                        </div>
