Jared was really hurting for some play, and since it's weird for me to play with just one other person, I made doe eyes at Sarah and apparently rolled a 20. I offered a one-shot using a mixture of the framing cards I designed for <i>The Libertines </i>(but decided against) and a really, really slim-and-trim version of FATE that I just kind of pulled out of the air as we played.<br/><br/>First off, the FATE-for-dummies variant I used:<br/><br/>Each character got 10 Aspects and 10 Fate Points. I think 10 FP is too much, so I might try 5 next time. I had them write down Health and Composure with 5 boxes each, but we never used them. Instead, we just used one roll to determine the winner of conflicts.<br/><br/>Fate Points acted as usual. +1 for just spending one. +2 for invoking an Aspect (they stacked the hell out of their aspects). Declare facts. I let them declare pretty much whatever they wanted to as long as it was awesome.<br/><br/>Now, the framing cards:<br/><br/>I bought a bunch of blank playing card-ish stock from a teacher supply store. Each card had a roman numeral on the bottom and a word or short phrase on the top:<br/><br/>1 = Setting (The Moors, The Graveyard, The Ruined Abbey, etc)<br/>2 = Time (Midnight, Dawn, etc.)<br/>3 = Stuff that adds mood but possibly has no impact on the story (Black, A Gnarled Tree, Wolves Howling, An Inexplicable Stench, Drought, etc.)...they actually all had major impact  on the story we played.<br/>4 = Character (A Stranger, A Boy, The Priest, The Innkeeper, etc.) There are also cards that modify these: (...who nobody listens to, ...who is extremely obese, etc.)<br/>5 = Situation (Fire!, Someone Disappears, An Execution, A Body is Found, etc.)<br/><br/>Each player drew a hand of ten cards. We rolled initiative for the first player. Sarah won (as usual) and put down a 1: <i>The School</i>. Jared put down a 2: <i>Sunset</i>. We took turns until we put down the following numbers of cards: 1 2 3 3 3  4 4 4 5, to get this situation:<br/><br/>The School...Sunset...Red...A Thunderstorm...An Inexplicable Stench...A Boy (who is mute, who is nervous)...A Stranger (who has just returned after many years)...Villagers...A Body is Found<br/><br/>...added characters, stirred a little and placed over fire.<br/><br/>I have a little more work to do on the cards, and then I'll probably put them up as a PDF somewhere.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192643/#Comment_192643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-15T09:38:28+00:00" title="February 15, 2009  9:38AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those cards sound great.
