What is it good for?  Lots of stuff, particularly when it comes to roleplaying games.  I'll venture every one of us has participated in some fictional war or another during the course of our fantasy- and SF-gaming careers, but I'm curious more about the historical wars that you've fought.<br/><br/>Even though wars interest me as an historian, given that they're such fertile ground for sudden socio-political change, I haven't done a lot of gaming set during these periods.  I gather that WWII is about as popular as historical wars get in terms of roleplaying love, but I've never actually run or played during that war.  WWI has always been just too damned depressing to game.  I've often thought something set during the French and Indian War would be interesting, but I haven't pursued the idea with much verve.  You'd also think the American Civil War would be a great background for a game, but I've never heard of anyone even trying such a thing.<br/><br/>In fact the only historical war I've gamed in was the Vietnam War, a gaming experience notable also for the diceless approach we took to much of the proceedings.  We weren't doing proto-<i>carry</i> gaming, either, but something more akin to the movie, <i>The Green Berets</i>.  John Wayne rules, Commies are bad, let's commence to the firefighting.<br/><br/>I suppose if you wanted to get very technical I also did some gaming in wartime Rhodesia using FGU's <i>Merc</i> system, but that was more like white-adventurer fantasy than anything resembling historicity.  <i>The Dogs of War</i> and <i>The Wild Geese</i> done tabletop.<br/><br/>What have you done?  What have you wanted to do?  If you haven't gotten around to gaming in a particular war, why not?  And what drew you to the war(s) you <i>have</i> played?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248140/#Comment_248140" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T14:53:59+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  2:53PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did a short-lived game based loosely on history, set during the Crusades, where the players alternated through the different sides: assassins, crusaders, and... uh... locals.

I really like resistance stories to begin with, there is just something very compelling about normal folk who take up arms to push out invaders. And then you add in the teenage romance element and the gradual tragic loss of innocence in Grey Ranks which really serves to anchor the game in the human stuff and not just the killing of nazis to round out the package.<br/><br/>There was a very bad game of Carry which was set in Vietnam, but the game was not a good fit for our play style.<br/><br/>I also played a Sons of Liberty game in the American Revolution... but that had a British Transforming Mecha printing house, Ninja Indians led by Swamp Fox, Evil George Washington Clones, Ornothopers and Sword fights on top of the Mecha... so I am not sure that was exactly historical... But I would love to play a serious game set in the Revolution. <br/><br/>Also I would love to play a game set during the Crusades with some Burning Wheel action, that would be awesome...<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248150/#Comment_248150" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T15:40:12+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  3:40PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2009 3:41PM by Z-Dog.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, Wars We've Fought would make an excellent RPG title.

It's an easy enough war setting to hook into, thanks to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow">Sharpe novels and telly series</a>.<br/><br/>I'm also running con game scenarios set in the Anglo-Zulu war of 1879, using the Duty &amp; Honour system. That's also a war-setting that's got easy enough hooks to draw on thanks to the classic film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_(film)" rel="nofollow">"ZULU"</a>. I'm also South African and we got fed a lot of <i>"The British Are Bastards"</i> at school, so there's the draw of playing out the Anglo-Boer conflicts in later scenarios too.<br/><br/>What's drawn me to those wars has been a flavourful story-game, easy hooks in terms of getting folks on the same page about a period of history, and an interest in the historical events of my mother country.<br/><br/>I'd like to play games set during WWII. I think the only thing really stopping that is a) finding enough free time to do so; and b) when I do find free time to game, there's a richness of games in other settings to play too, so while WWII games are in the queue, they're well behind Kagematsu, Mouse Guard, Medical Hospital, WFRP 3rd, and Burning Empires... and that's just my list.

The American Civil War was also on the agenda - the game was intended to carry the characters through to Elder status.<br/><br/>- I've played <i>carry</i> and <i>Montsegur: 1244</i>, which have set war settings.<br/><br/>- I have an <i>Unsung</i> scenario written in which all the characters are members of one of the Indian all-female FPUs deployed to Liberia as part of UNMIL.  Unfortunately, I have never found players for it when I've tried to run it, probably because there are not many other gamers/huge peacekeeping nerds to whom that sounds like a fun game.  Jason Morningstar has also unwisely encouraged me to write up a game about UNTAC where you just ask the Khmer Rouge very nicely to move their stick that's blocking the road.<br/><br/>- I started another Vampire game where the PCs were a pack of Sabbat sent into Baghdad during the US assault (the Ventrue were behind OIF), but real life intervened (ironically, a job that entailed going to Iraq).<br/><br/>- I ran a one-shot of Steal Away Jordan set in the Sea Islands on the cusp of the Civil War.  I'd like to try the setting again, with some more research and more breathing room to get my feet under me with the system.<br/><br/>- I ran a D&amp;D3.5 campaign set in Eberron, where a major plot point was a thinly-veiled Rwandan genocide in Darguun (complete with most authorities not caring about goblinoid-on-goblinoid violence, and writing it off as "tribal savagery..." something that the players bought into...)<br/><br/>- In games that were not themselves all about a war:  I played a character in an awful game of Shock: (the suck due to the guy to my antagonist player) who was a war criminal from a thinly-veiled Chechen war, one Vampire character who was an Old Clan Tzimisce from Afghanistan who came to the US after the 2001 invasion, and an In Nomine character who was a Mercurian of Faith banished to Mexico for engaging in violence on behalf of the PLO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito" title="Davide Losito"><img alt="Davide Losito" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.webinprogress.it/allyraid/badtoro2out.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito">Davide Losito</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248160/#Comment_248160" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T16:32:01+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  4:32PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a game called Memories of War.<br/>It tells the stories of 4 soldiers that died in a war.

None of them ever seem to take that up, or only as an afterthought. I can't quite pick the Brits as the baddies, at least not alone- pretty much all the White Boys with Guns ( and the Japanese, too) are pretty goods bets for the role of Higher Tech Expansionist Dicks in that period. Not that natives are exactly charmers, either, especially since a lot of those conflicts seem to start with "Let's have a bloody purge of the White Boys' local Stooges;  You know, the unarmed ones first!".\n<blockquote>Where we did "Land of the exploding sun" for the events after Hiroshima.</blockquote>\nI could see <i>Barefoot Gen </i>and <i>Graveyard of the Fireflies </i>being good, player accessible, source material for that.\n<blockquote>I used to run Free Kriegspiel games that only game the players what their commanders could see and hear. They were very fun war games that did involve a lot of role playing. Also I did a variation on this for WWI battles where players had terrain move by their figures so they never knew exactly where they were - much insanity ensued - very fun if excessively bloody.</blockquote>\nReminds me of one of Paddy Griffith's games called <i>Men Against Fire</i> that I played once with a couple of S-G members. Confusing and taumatizing. A bit like the first ten minutes of <i>Saving Private Ryan </i>as a lite, focused RPG.\n<blockquote>Personally now I'm fairly bored with war. Battles are like choreographed dances. One side attacks and their routs the enemy or is dealt a bloody repulse. The uniforms change but the dance remains the same.</blockquote>\nMentally, I have a sub-category I call "battle-games" to describe that. And yes, most minis wargame rules tend to produce that and after a while it does seem terribly same-y.<br/><br/>My suspicion from various readings is that the described boredom with same-iness is what led to RPGs in the first place ( or was at least a major contributing factor).<br/><br/>Weirdly, I think that accepting some of that same-iness miht be a worthwhile starting point for more flexible approaches the gaming wars and even battle-games.\n<blockquote>Eventually I'll run miniatures game about the wars in the Middle East of the last 30 years but I've not quite got the figures collected yet.

It certainly does make iut easy to re-skin things, however. As to civillian figures, well, I personally think any sort of roleplaying-ish thing with minis ought to start with them, not bring them in as an afterthought.<br/><br/>Which is, naturally, unlikely to ever happen, but I can put it out there, can't I ? ;-)<br/><br/>I'm looking into cheap plastic, unpainted model rail road figures for that sort of thing. I doubt it would help much for Middle East stuff, though, unless you were talented with The Green Stuff (epoxy putty) or something similar.\n<blockquote>They get at the story behind the shooting which I like.

I've never been able to sell that idea to enough players to make it work.<br/><br/>Even adding in 'kewl stuff' doesn't seem to attract anyone in either of my gaming groups.  The Savage Worlds 'Weird War' setting look like fun to me, but not to my friends.<br/><br/>Outside of historical truth, I've always wanted to run or play in a game inspired by VOTOMS and the early Gundam series, set amidst a quasi-hard-science mecha war -- same deal.  Additional resistance to 'giant robots' from the mostly non-fans of anime in my groups may be a contributing factor, here. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>What wars <i>have</i> I RPGed in or with?<br/><br/>As pointed out upthread, <i>Sons of Liberty</i> counts, being set during a war.  I've played it and loved it.  It's a blast every time, but, as also pointed out upthread, it's not exactly hard history.  <br/><br/>I've run a pulp game set during the wind-up to WWII, Indiana Jones style.  High-spirited Nazi-bashing is always fun.  Not hard history either.  <br/><br/>I'm involved in a <i>Universalis</i> game that is set (at least initially) during WWI.  However, it doesn't address many of the issues or themes of that war, since the story we're telling is one of supernatural horror investigations.  The war is just the grim backdrop for even grimmer events.  If it weren't being played with <i>Universalis</i>, it would be easiest to do that game in <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i>...  <br/><br/>I'm detecting a theme in my RPG warfare:  the people I game with don't seem to like playing soldiers.  Maybe it's because being part of an army, with a command structure, feels too restrictive of their freedom to do as they please with their characters -- despite the fact that several of them are perfectly happy in games where some 'Mr. Johnson' gives them a mission at the start of every session.  <br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mikeb" title="mikeb"><img alt="mikeb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wecanhelpit.com/tinybee.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mikeb">mikeb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248280/#Comment_248280" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T09:57:16+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  9:57AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been working on a setting concept for bySwarm called Mist &amp; Shadow that is set in an alternative history version of WW1. The themes of mist and shadow come into play via a conspiracy organization that is trying to destroy Europe in order to build a new world order from the ashes and that organization is being battled in a secret war with a more fantasy-styled organization that utilizes mystical and mutation-causing chemical weapons. The main thing that attracted me to WW1 was that it really represented the end of the old empires being run by nobility. This means that you can bring in some of the traditional elements of fantasy that come from feudal Europe but also mix a lot of different cultures in one setting. WW1 also interested me because I don't feel like it is a historical period that gets a lot of attention from a gaming context - WW2, Vietnam, the American Civil War, and the American Revolutionary War get a lot more attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248294/#Comment_248294" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T10:52:05+00:00" title="December 23, 2009 10:52AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What I've Done:</b> I'm currently playing a Burning Wheel campaign in the Viking Invasion period of Ireland.

WW2 is a huge interest for me, and I feel quite comfortable working with various themes, time periods, theaters, operations, etc. I also do not fear implementing a chain-of-command among the characters - I've gotten this to work many times - or having the characters just be grunts or other sorts of rankers and not commandos or special forces or some other type of unit operating outside of the box. Grunts on the line can tell powerful stories.<br/><br/><b>What I've done</b><br/><br/><b>WW2</b><br/><br/>Godlike - Recently finished <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=414584" rel="nofollow">this campaign</a> that took a Talent squad from the beaches of Normandy to the Liberation of Paris. Riffing heavily on Band of Brothers and nailing that vibe more than a few times. Perhaps of interest, we used a full minis table and Flames of War minis more than once (pics in <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=414584&amp;page=15" rel="nofollow">post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2372&amp;Mode=like">#72</a></a>) but no minis rules - just pushed the minis around to show relative positions. I've done several Godlike oneshots (and I have another in the works).<br/><br/>Weird Wars - While writing this Savage Worlds setting book, I did a lot of playtesting that involved various scenarios - a tank battle at Kursk, dogfighting in the Battle of Britain, PT boats in the Solomon Islands, and G.I.'s in the Ardennes.<br/><br/>Grey Ranks - Only had playtest sessions with this. Really need to get a game going with the final version.<br/><br/><b>WW1</b><br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu - I ran No Man's Land years ago, but don't remember it so well. I'd like to try a focused game about the trenches (gloom).<br/><br/><b>Vietnam</b><br/><br/>Carry - This is another really good game I need to run more.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu - Did a Vietnam oneshot with a bit of Delta Green crossover.<br/><br/><b>Cold War</b><br/><br/>Merc - An old game from FGU. Played this a lot in high school, running games involving various brushfire wars in Africa and Central America.<br/><br/><b>Sci-Fi</b><br/><br/>2300AD - I pulled out this old GDW sci-fi game and ran <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=268872" rel="nofollow">a French Foreign Legion campaign</a> with it. The tone we set with this one was a preclude to what I did with the Godlike campaign above.<br/><br/><b>What I'd like to do</b><br/><br/>Having run a Godlike campaign set in Europe, I'd like to do one set in the Pacific, specifically the China-Burma-India theater, with Stillwell's troops out in the steaming jungle somewhere. That or island hopping U.S. Marines. WW2 has so many aspects to it and so many potential stories you can tell, and there's a tremendous amount of source material to draw on.<br/><br/>I'd also really like to do a<i> Das Boot</i> in Space type of game (like A Passage At Arms) with 2300AD. Why? I think this situation is ripe for drama and since it seems like such a challenge to run, I want to give it a go. Also in the sci-fi vein, I'd love to do a Hammers Slammers game (but not with MGT)<br/><br/>Very interested in Duty &amp; Honor and Black Cadillacs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248414/#Comment_248414" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-24T05:11:06+00:00" title="December 24, 2009  5:11AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that wars make cool settings, but military line of command stiffles adventures.

There's <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8632" rel="nofollow">an AP thread on Story Games about our game</a>.  I think it is interesting to reflect why we did it. These reasons come to mind:\n<ul>\n<li>It was a current on-going conflict and we wanted to process the imagery and information fed to us through media.</li>\n<li>We were interested on ultramodern complex (sub)urban conflicts, what they are like to the participants as combatants and as human beings</li>\n<li>I was interested in trying out Shell Shock (and I'm glad I did)</li>\n<li>The Israeli soldiers seemed like a good identification point. On some level it seems that there are a lot in common with young (well youngish on the part of most of the players) men in Israel and in Finland.</li>\n<li>I think that we were interested in a setup where there were no easy decisions, and each decision would end up shaping the image of the characters as moral agents. We certainly got that out of the game.</li>\n</ul>\nThose are just some things I think interested us in the setup. How much our game represents the actual conflict is anybody's guess. As I said before I think the game portrayed our different perceptions and even conscious explorations around the theme of the real-world conflict more than the conflict itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251245/#Comment_251245" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T08:46:18+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  8:46AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to point interested parties to a related discussion: I was thinking about the Vietnam War in particular and how all Vietnam stories seem to blend into each other now.
