If you've published a game, what emotions are associated with it - before publishing, at the moment of publication, after publishing?

Sure, there are rough patches, like when one change affects 60% of the rest of the work you've already done (had that happen before and it sucks), but it is an enjoyable experience for most of the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter publishing, it's actually even better. I like to sell the books so that i have enough to make another of course, but i love the feedback that i receive from readers more than anything else. When i just released my second book for the Apocalypse Prevention, Inc. line (API Worldwide: Canada), it was an awesome feeling that there were people that couldn't wait for it to be released and bought it the first day. Talk about an ego boost.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould i do it again? Hells yeah!

Because I'm constantly working on something, there's hardly a time where I don't feel like this in regards to some project.<br><br><b>During:</b> Even when you have something done, dealing with all the little steps of printing and distribution are a royal pain.  Even when I ran off those 50 copies of Geiger Beta and overnighted them to GenCon, that was a lot of stress and scrambling.  Also, you inevitably find mistakes in your game after you print it, which is upsetting.<br><br><b>After:</b> Worrying about whether I should be promoting my products more; worrying about whether I'm even making money of sales of Push 1 to game stores through IPR; worrying about keeping track of sales so I can pay contributors their cut of Push 1; worrying about the next project or how to revise Geiger Beta for the Gamma version.  Feeling the responsibility of running the game a lot at conventions, instead of enjoying playing other things.<br><br><b>Summary:</b> Almost everything about self-publishing sucks for me, which is why I keep trying to get away from it.  In contrast, working on Hard Boiled Cultures with Fred was liberatingly easy and invigorating, since we went from concept to finished product in a couple weeks.  I'm just not emotionally prepared to do the autuer indie designer thing where you spend a couple years toiling over a 100+ page game.  For a while, I felt like there was something deeply wrong with me for not being able to do that, but I'm increasingly trying to turn instead to design and publishing models that work much better for me, instead of feeling required to jump through the hoops I've constructed for myself in my head.  I think contest games, roleplaying poems, and stuff like Mexican Standoff, XXXTreme Street Luge, and Ghost/Echo are great pointers in that direction.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193238/#Comment_193238" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T09:36:14+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  9:36AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I approach publishing with a very craftsman-like ethos, and I am most happy when the finished product is well put together and looks good \u2014 the same sort of feeling that you'd have when you just made, for instance, a good-looking and sturdy chair.

I love the rush when I realize that this idea is *good*. I enjoy writing. There's a bad moment when I can't stop thinking about an idea that's not working. I get grumpy.<br/><br/>I like it when other people spark to my game and want to talk about it and play it. It makes my day shine. When it doesn't happen, the game dies on the vine, no matter how good the idea was. That's sad, but there are always more ideas. There's fear here too. Nobody wants to see their idea wither.<br/><br/>The logistics of publishing are a meaningful challenge. They aren't fun in their own right, but I enjoy figuring out how to do something I've never done before. When publishing happens at the same time as life, I get stressed. I'm not that much fun to be around.<br/><br/>Seeing the book in print is weird and beguiling, like finding a baby flower fairy in a basket on your doorstep in the morning.<br/><br/>Marketing is another puzzle. I find marketing to be a weirdly satisfying process. I claim it's because I like to see my game get to the right people, but I suspect it's actually rooted in vanity. I am a vain person.<br/><br/>Fulfillment is a minor annoyance, but I do get to communicate with each person that buys my game, no matter how briefly. That takes the sting out of fulfillment and makes it worthwhile.<br/><br/>Going to Gen Con and actively demo-ing my game to people was deeply fun. It was the most fun part of making How to Host a Dungeon. I don't know if that feeling will stay or not. I think I enjoyed Gen Con a lot more for having a meaningful job to do than I would have if I'd just gone for fun.<br/><br/>Getting money is nice. It makes me just a little less fearful about the future to know that I'm making some money, no matter how little, at something that's not my primary career.<br/><br/>All in all, the good massively outweights the bad.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193311/#Comment_193311" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T15:37:33+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  3:37PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193324/#Comment_193324" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T17:08:46+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  5:08PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2009 5:10PM by Colin_Fredericks.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is fun to see the <i>results</i> of publishing.<br/><br/>The <i>process</i> of publishing is not very fun.

Generally speaking, it's enough to pay for new equipment, the next print run, and lets me support my game purchasing habits while calling it "research".<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193389/#Comment_193389" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T07:51:13+00:00" title="February 20, 2009  7:51AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The layout/art/selling part was in many ways more fun than the writing and testing.

If it's not too much of a derailment, I'm curious as to why that is. As I explained in the "Swedes suck at promotion" thread, I just do the publishing (also partly for the craftmanship reward), but don't promote, apart from mentioning my game in discussions where it's relevant. Lulu is great for this, since there is no cost attached to publishing the game (except if you hire other people to do parts of it for you), and it's always availible for anyone who wants to buy it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193401/#Comment_193401" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T09:16:41+00:00" title="February 20, 2009  9:16AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, I could speak at length to that question, but it's probably a different thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
