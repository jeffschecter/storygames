For example, we're playing Mortal Coil at the moment and (some of) the constraints on our game are the following (I'm not going to list them all but I will give examples):<br/>- theme document, this tells what characters can't do (such as only those from Jersey can do magic), what our characters might do (children can create magical constructs) and what as players we should do (keep magic bubbly and light, focus on keeping secrets v saving people).<br/>- stats, we've chosen to play with medium magic and novice characters. This gives us quite a lot of largesse in creating magical effects and using them but means that our characters are not as effective as many of those in the game.<br/>- rules, the rules limit the number of actions per round of conflict, how many power tokens are available for use, say what a conflict is<br/>- social considerations limit anyone from dominating the game (we're playing without a GM)<br/>- group or individual story considerations influence whether a scene leads to a conflict or not (for example there was a conflict to force Alex's character to where a uniform but not to have mine shut in the attic). These also make us look at how our characters behave in an effort to make this believable. This interacts with the theme document considerations.<br/><br/>We constrain what the players do and what the characters do, either through rules, through things the rules make us create or through social and story considerations.<br/><br/>So, I wonder if other story gamers could perform similar analyses on their games, using examples. I'd also be interested to hear about unconstrained elements of the game (for example in Ocean, the monster element of the game is, apart from the fact that there are monsters, unconstrained).<br/><br/>Also, please don't use theory jargon and illustrate what you say with examples.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274845/#Comment_274845" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T09:50:22+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  9:50AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting. I tend to think of "creative constraints" as something that applies to the design. I have certainly had pre-game discussions with my group before about playing "in genre" or setting boundaries and such, but I never thought of them as "constraints." It makes perfect sense to treat them as creative constraints, and I think that phrase has a more positive ring to it than talking about boundaries, limitations, appropriateness, or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274856/#Comment_274856" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T10:36:49+00:00" title="June  7, 2010 10:36AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been struggling to articulate some ideas on this subject for a couple of weeks now, thoughts occasioned by my recent reading of Motte's reader on the Oulipo, and by my play of <i>A Penny For My Thoughts</i>. In outline, I think that constraints - formal requirements that the rules require us to meet as we tell our stories - take the place of inspiration, and that that's a good thing, because inspiration is both overvalued and underavailable when we're improvising. Participatory media can't count on talent or inspiration, and they need to run on enthusiasm and formal constraint instead, so we're set up to succeed, rather than all-but-guaranteed to fail.<br/><br/><i>Penny</i> enters into this because of the stark contrast I've seen between games played in "kitchen-sink dramatics" mode, with Facts &amp; Reassurances roughly equivalent to the real world, versus in games played with a genre-bound set of Facts &amp; Reassurances. The only genre F&amp;R I've used is the Lovecraftian setting ("The Shadow Out Of Memory"), so I'll restrict my comments to that. When we played with the default F&amp;R, I saw people freezing up a lot, stunned by too many options. There was no single obvious way forward. Open the refrigerator in the dark kitchen: what happens? A piece of cake reminds you of the charming third birthday party you were at, where your niece was so happy? You open yet another beer, coming to realize that maybe it's a problem? There are no more pickles, which is mildly irritating, because you really wanted one? It could be anything. If you're playing inspired, that wide-open narrative space can be an asset, but at least as often it's a burden. By contrast, consider that you've been told you're living in Lovecraft Horror World. You go into the darkened kitchen and open the refrigerator door: what happens? Nothing good, that's for sure! That contraction of the space of possible continuations is paradoxically liberating. I've had so much more success with "The Shadow Out Of Memory" than I have with the default game that it's getting hard for me to justify playing it any other way. When I revise my <i>Hammer of the Gods</i>/<i>Some Kind of Monster</i>-inspired F&amp;R, it will be to make it bind much tighter, because seriously, screw inspiration. <br/><br/>Related: The single most exciting thing for me about <i>Apocalypse World</i> is that the MC (the GM-ish player) is utterly in chains. Nothing to say right now? Barf forth apocalyptica! Do a move! None of the suffocating freedom of the old school, no need for inspiration. Pick from a list and keep going. Sitting around awkwardly waiting for the Muse to whack you upside the head is not fun. Jamming on a story is fun! Doing that more and the other thing less, then, seems like the way forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274950/#Comment_274950" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T06:10:45+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  6:10AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a similar problem in Penny, without any constraints it went gonzo, or turned into an exquisite corpse.

I was trying to respond to <i>"What are they in your game?"</i> except I turned the "what" into a "why". So why constraints? <i>Because</i> of those reasons. That's why I include constraints in my games or why I appreciate constraints in other games.<br/><br/>As for examples...in Pilgrims to Ruin, I included a list of places that the characters might find themselves in, even if I could leave the architecture to the city to the GM. This takes some of the burden off the GM's back. If they don't know where the characters arrive next, they can just look at the list and pick a place. It's nothing more than a name, but limiting the available locations to a list constrains the GM and makes his job easier.<br/><br/>Likewise I included a list of named monsters that have a goal clause and a fulfilment clause. PtR does not give any stats for the world or NPCs, because it doesn't need to, but looking at the list, the GM is restricted to make those monsters act according to their goal, but rein them it when the fulfilment clause is accomplished. I think this makes for a much stronger play technique if you have these "<i>ghoul dogs</i> that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">want</span> <i>fresh human meat</i> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most of all</span> but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will be satisfied with</span> <i>any kind of meat</i>" as opposed to a statblock that would restrict them in terms <i>what they can do</i> instead of <i>what they actually do</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274970/#Comment_274970" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T08:07:09+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  8:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor,<br/><br/>That's hot stuff.

Famous though Oulipo is for syntactic and morphological wordplay, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogram" rel="nofollow">lipograms</a> and highly formal lyrical compositions - as a group, Oulipo found constraints with roots in signification most difficult and satisfying. You should look into Calvino's book... what was it again? I can't say. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Crossed_Destinies" rel="nofollow">Look it up!</a> Anyhow, Calvino's book with a plot built around Tarot iconography. By Oulipian lights, it was inspiring, showing a way forward. <br/><br/>What I'm saying is that a constraint built around signification (or inspiration, or guiding a group toward a particular kind of story) is a constraint worth including and worth applying just this kind of analysis to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275053/#Comment_275053" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T19:36:31+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  7:36PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2010 7:40PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm kind of with Jonathan in that constraints are definitely super-interesting but they're also kind of, well, universally present in every aspect of roleplaying. It seems to make more sense to look at the degree of the constraint, maybe, and particularly the way the <i>relative degrees of constraint</i> regarding different parts of the game result in a particular kind of play/fiction.<br/><br/>For example, Jackson Tegu's game <i>The Hydra</i>, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9793&amp;page=1#Item_10" rel="nofollow">which I played at the last GoPlayNW</a>, provides extreme constraints in terms of player input into the fiction and the total size of the fiction. There are only 10 scenes in the game, and each scene can only have 4 lines of dialogue -- split between the two players. Your character can only speak out loud 20 times during the course of the game. However, each scene allows a theoretically unlimited amount of <i>non-dialogue description</i> to occur between the dialogue. <br/><br/>The results of these lopsided constraints included: each individual line of dialogue became extremely important and dramatic; subtext provided by non-verbal descriptions and interactions were emphasized; the pacing of the scenes was extraordinarily drawn-out; sensory description of the scene was much more developped. I could go on -- the game provided an extremely focused experience in part by providing a very high level of constraint on the type and structure of input, while providing almost no constraints at all on the content of that input.<br/><br/>To my mind this is what games like Penny For Your Thoughts are aiming for as well, which is why adding a layer of Genre constraints, as described, would pretty much eliminate my desire to play the game. I agree that it would make the game a lot easier to play, however -- but to my mind it is kind of undermining the whole structural appeal of the game, which is to provide an enormous amount of constraint on a level that we don't normally see, and none at all on the level we expect.<br/><br/><br/>P.S.

This has also worked to focus events in the narrative.<br/> <br/>A second form of restraint in the game is a form of metacurrency that all players have access to, allowing anyone not currently involved in a scene to introduce elements into a scene. Most of the two-hundred odd players I've put through it haven't seen the metacurrency as a constraint, but more as an opportunity for meaningful input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275090/#Comment_275090" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T02:55:40+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  2:55AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another thing to consider, what kind of constraints do you prefer?<br/><br/>In our Mortal Coil game, I let my character be locked in the attic because I thought it would make for an interesting story.<br/><br/>Had we been playing FATE, I would have tag some aspect of the attic, or my character to use my PCs misfortune to generate a FATE point.<br/><br/>In the first I'm encourage to explore through storytelling considerations, in the second, to a certain extent, by the reward given to me by the rules.<br/><br/>Personally, I'll always go for the first option.

On the topic of constraint, I'm finding it really difficult to come up with anything brief. The word "constraint" is synonymous with "rule." Games are made up of rules.<br/><br/>Here's my wanky synopsis. Constraint makes story.<br/><br/>Because it fascinates me as a subject, I'll mention something <i>constraint-esque</i> from Hell for Leather. The tag line is that "murder gives you extra dice." The interesting question from a design perspective is "why," "how" and, specifically, "how is this constrained?"<br/><br/>I'm just going to explore the last part. I was conscious that players of the game enjoyed describing gruesome bloodshed. The simple solution for implementing the feature was to give players more bloodshed for each unit of violence they chose to commit (from one to three). That gave me three grades of violence. Initially, I went with:<br/><br/>1: Aggravated assault<br/>2: Murder<br/>3: Mass murder<br/><br/>It seemed to fit the bill. After lots of playtesting, I realised that the criteria for each grade of violence did not address what the players were looking for. One player could describe a super-gory gouging of the eye using grade one, while the other could describe a super-tame bus explosion using grade three.<br/><br/>It was then when I came across conversations on the topic of constraint and I realised where I'd gone wrong. I had to look at what the player wanted and then offer it in parts. That is, if a player wanted to describe super-gore, I would have to build a better system to deliver that gore and at the same time limit it. The final treatment ended up (constraints in bold):<br/><br/>1: Brief - Describe <b>one</b> violent action. <b>No blood</b>.<br/>2: Splatter - Add a <b>noise</b> and <b>at least one bodily fluid</b>.<br/>3: Replay - Tell the death <b>from the victim's perspective</b>.<br/><br/>Each grade is described in turn up until the level of the violence committed. Here's an example:<br/><br/>1: I shoot the driver.<br/>2: (continuing) The driver gargles nosily as blood explodes from his throat.<br/>3: (continuing) Replay! The driver is whipping around the corner, tailing a black van ahead. Now he sees a man leaning out with a rifle. Oh shit! He slams on the breaks, but it's too late. Suddenly the windscreen cracks. He looks down as blood spills onto his lap and slumps against the car horn. It bleats noisily as he slips into unconsciousness.<br/><br/>There are three uses of the same kind of constraint going on here. First, the player is cued for simple criteria, which helps free the creativity. Second, the criteria are layered, so that a player cumulatively contributes story\u2014the player doesn't have to think of everything at once, he does it in layered stages. Thirdly, the contributions are scaled according to the mechanics, so that a player is rewarded with more fun (?) when he opts to buy the most expensive grade of violence.<br/><br/>So, while each stage of the violence mechanic is constrained, the stages are cumulative so that the narrative becomes richer by each additional layer. Baby steps. I'm sure a lot of other games use this layering and I'd love to hear about them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275092/#Comment_275092" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T03:40:23+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  3:40AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, there was a bit of a lag in my post. I didn't mean to ignore your question Steve.<br/><br/>I'm going to go for the second option, the rules. I think the first option nullifies itself, in a way. It's not a cage if you choose to be there, if you know what I mean. The constraint is just as much a selection of a set as anything else. While that's great for storytelling, I think that is also so fundamental, that it actually <i>is</i> storytelling. I mean, if I say that we're in a scene on the end of a pier, and it's raining, we know what our character can and can't do. Similarly if I said we were on the moon, that would serve the same purpose. The constraint there is a cue for your brain to imagine a scene (by differentiating it from nothingness by the features it contains and does not contain).<br/><br/>So, I choose the rules option. I like a game that encourages constraint in interesting ways, that motivates me in unforeseen directions and rewards me for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275099/#Comment_275099" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T04:38:05+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  4:38AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sebastian K.

The very word "define" means "make boundaries".<br/><br/>So I guess that's a wacky way of saying "yes I agree that the very nature of games, heck of creativity itself, is the use of constraints". On the other hand, as others have mentioned, the type of constraint and the degree to which it is a conscious one makes a difference for play and creativity and such, so I think it's worth discussing in that sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275117/#Comment_275117" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T07:34:02+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  7:34AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm intrigued by the difference between rule-function and play-experience.<br/>For example, in Polaris, the text suggests saying the key phrases exactly as written.

And you are essentially calling out examples of them. But I'll try to keep the rest of the theory to a minimum.<br/><br/>It is worth pointing out that social and personal habits are typically far stronger limit on what can happen in play than rules laid out in a book. Time and time again I've seen a group of players balk at a shift out of their current patterns of behavior, without any violation of the rules occurring. <br/><br/>To my mind what is especially fascinating about constraints is how they emerge during play - because I've never found any pre-game discussion sufficient to nail down the creative space well enough there is always a back and forth interaction during play. You introduce a romantic element to your character and its reception tells us all whether that direction will be fruitful. This is why I've often found "offering options" as a useful table-talk technique - not only does it give the other player ideas, but it narrows the space of what is considered around those options. If another player is considering a course of action, such as attacking a nightwatchman, then offering the suggestion of sneaking up behind him to cut his throat opens the scope of solutions to violent ways of resolving the problem, while suggesting bribery widens the scope significantly to nonviolent solutions, but doesn't bring up indirect methods.<br/><br/>Constraints are important for more than story, without them the play becomes incomprehensible (or exquisite corpse as it were). But at the same time, too many constraints will make play extremely predictable and ultimately not very interesting. (See <a href="http://www.theoryoffun.com/" rel="nofollow">A Theory of Fun</a> for one possible reason why.)<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275173/#Comment_275173" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T11:33:58+00:00" title="June  9, 2010 11:33AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Arguably, if you say "you ask too much" instead of the proper "you ask<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>far</i></span>too much", there is no mechanical difference.

Especially since I'm in the middle of making revisions to Thou Art But A Warrior and have been immersed in the Polaris rules for quite a while now.)<br/><br/>It does make a meaningful difference in Polaris. Everything in that book is very carefully crafted to produce a particular sort of story with a particular tone. Polaris is an engine for creating tragedies, so <i>every</i> statement that the Mistaken makes is asking too much. Your character doesn't want to have their hand chopped off, or to have their lover be their twin, or their father possessed by demons. But at a certain point you draw a line in the sand and say "no! This is too much badness even for Polaris!". Which is why the phrase is "you ask <span style="text-decoration: underline;">far</span> too much". It's a small semantic difference, but it is meaningful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
