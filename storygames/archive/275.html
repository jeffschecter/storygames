<p>So there's all that talk about Firefly/Serenity being about <strong>Family</strong> and stuff. What if you drew up the characters' relationships as if they WERE one big extended family, then treat that as a metaphor for their relationships. Parent-child relationships reflect relations of protection/overprotection and respect/rebellion. Siblings would share.rivalries/loyalties, and perhaps marriage would be defined as a combination of both.</p>
<ul>
<li>Book: Grandfather ot Mal</li>
<li>Mal: Married either to Zoe or Inara</li>
<li>Kaylee: Child to Mal or Inara</li>
<li>Wash: Possibly married or sibling or even child to Zoe, depending on how you want ot spin it.</li>
<li>Simon/River: Definitely married.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take these metaphorical ties, and overlap that with the <em>actual</em> ties of blood/love/loyalty that the characters acknowledge. What do you get?</p>

                            If you want to overlay metaphorical dependencies on actual kinship, using different terms would be helpful.  Because "Wash is Zoe's child, but also her husband" is going to throw people, especially on an R-Map that does not describe a popular TV show.<br/><br/>Cool idea, though!                        </div>

                            This is a good idea.  Partly because these metaphorical relationships often have as much importance in a story as real relationships.  Uncle Ben and the Green Goblin both function as Peter Parker's father figure (in the movie, anyway).  Or Obi-Wan and Darth Vader, for that matter.                        </div>
