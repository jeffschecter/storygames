Height now means speed and hit location. Width is effectiveness.<br/>-Directly off this, you change the hit locations depending on stance. The quickest and easiest to hit are the 10, 9, 8 locations and the hardest to hit, taking work and a bit more timing are the 3, 2, 1 locations. A standard orthodox stance might have 10 - left arm, 9, 8 - left leg, 7 - right arm, 6, 5 - right leg, 4 - stomach, 3 - chest, 2 - head, 1 - neck (if you want to get that detailed). Fighting defensively would increase difficulty meaning if you need a 3 or better to hit at all, the head and neck become totally off limits. In general, head would be the lowest one. Any stance change would change the hit locations.<br/><br/>3 combat skills, striking, wrestling and grappling. Striking is fairly self explanatory - punching, kicking, kneeing, elbowing, headbutting. Any character could have any level of dice in that, some people have it naturally, others need to train. Up to the player how he got there. Training gets you additional stances, as well as extra boxes of toughness to certain locations. <br/><br/>Wrestling is what most people are familiar with, trying to force the other person down. It's pretty much universal as every culture has some style of folk wrestling, and most everyone has some experience with it from school, so every character has 1 die in wrestling - potentially more if they learned by the school of hard knocks, but again official training is what gets you additional stances.<br/><br/>Grappling is completely foreign to most people, and can only be acquired by training. It's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Ne Waza Judo primarily. <br/><br/>Striking and wrestling do shock damage. Grappling can do shock or killing damage (player's choice). <br/><br/>No specific techniques are learned for a style, it's all in the stances and positions. Thematically a boxer would only attack with punches and a muay thai fighter with everything available, but practically boxers fight dirty and use elbows too, as well as attacking below the belt. The difference is that a boxer has no extra toughness for the legs, so that becomes a really easy target to chop down the tree so to speak.<br/><br/>Wrestling would be engaged with a grab attack, it would resolve the same as a striking attack, except width doesn't deal any damage, just the result. 2W is a grab into standing scramble, 3W is a takedown into ground scramble and 4W+ is takedown into dominant position. 2W isn't that good against another wrestler, as the outcome is 50/50, but against a striker it forces them to wrestle rather than strike. 3W is good against a wrestler, potentially bad against a grappler. If the defender successfully defends, he just gets back to neutral (as opposed to 2W where a successful defense is a counter, advancing position), and if the attacker succeeds he gets his dominant position. Successful defense by a grappler could turn bad for a wrestler, depending on additional training. 4W is universally good.<br/><br/>Standing scrambles would have a different set of stances, and depending which hit location turned up, the positions will be different. That will determine the result of the scramble, and it's about whoever gets off first. There could be quite a succession of offense/defense switches going on.<br/><br/>Ground scrambles would work in a similar fashion, but characters would be fighting from their desired position mechanically even if they're not there.<br/><br/>Grappling again has another set of positions, with options between positional changes and holds.<br/><br/>Where a bit of rock paper scissors comes in is that any attack with a skill forces a defesne with the same skill. If someone with 6d in wrestling grabs someone with 6d in striking, but 1d in wrestling, the striker now only has 1d to fight back with and can't use striking. If someone with 6d in grappling hits a position where he can grapple from against a wrestler with 0d in grappling, it's pretty much game over. <br/><br/>Where ORE works perfectly for this is that the fight is always very hectic, it already includes support for called shots and the like, but realistically you take whatever opening presents itself - this is true for striking, wrestling and grappling. The mechanics don't have to change, except for indicating whether you're using a skill to deal damage or change position (in the case of wrestling and grappling). There isn't too much tactical decision making as you just say what stance you're in, or what stance you're moving to, and roll attacks and defenses. The dice show what happens and what the options are, and then it's up to the players to narrate the specifics.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
