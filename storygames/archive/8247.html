It's for a game like Fung Shui or similar - inspired by kung fu/wuxia/etc. movies.<br/><br/>My objective is to set the location for fight scenes without the need for a GM to "set the setting", as it were. It's also a way to bring in reincorporation, a Chekov's gun kind of thing.<br/><br/>The idea is, fight scenes play out in two parts: a set up scene, and the actual fight.<br/><br/>During the set-up scene, the players roleplay, and as they narrate in details, they write them down on little index cards. So maybe my character and Jane's character are sitting a a table in a teahouse, and so I narrate "I pour out the tea") and write down "steaming hot kettle of boiling water" on an index card.<br/><br/>Later on when the fight actually breaks out, we get to reincorporate the details on the cards, and when we do so some mechanical bonus applies. So maybe Jane's character ends up jumping down hard on the table on one end, catapulting the kettle into the air and dumping scalding water onto my characters head.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181523/#Comment_181523" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T10:31:07+00:00" title="December  4, 2008 10:31AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, sure--sounds like what I do in ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a>, to establish a zone.

Is there a mechanical benefit attached to using one of the scene elements? Can each element only be used once? Is this the type of setting where you are likely to return to this set? Most of the wuxia I watch are fast paced and few sets get revisited, so I am not sure the need for cards.

Beyond the basic location (tea house), why not let folks introduce impromptu elements, use them as they wish (for mechanical benefit, it would be presumed) and only be beholden to the other players' right to call bullshit?<br/><br/>So, if I want an extra d6 (or whatever) from a stunt-type maneuver, I pay my resource (presumably you don't want folks narrating in a bajillion bennies every action, so limit it), I say, "And I catapult the boiling-hot pot of tea into your head" and then you might counter than with your own resource allocation and say "Bullshit, that tea's been sitting there for long enough that it's nowhere NEAR hot enough to scald" and maybe then we get a vote from the other players. Something like Universalis, basically (all games are something like Universalis, I am coming to realize).<br/><br/>In essence, that's what one can do in A@H with a Stunt die narration, but I don't emphasize it nearly enough in the text, I think now. Stunting should be one of the core elements, common to every fight (and it hasn't been in playtest).

It's simply a dramatically satisfying thing to have the gun you placed on the mantlepiece in act one be fired in act three - and the same applies to the kettle, albeit on a shorter time frame. It's not to say that you couldn't ALSO invent stuff on the fly.<br/><br/>Another reason is to get a sense of the geography of the location - not in the sense of having an actual map, but a kind of conceptual linkage - the trolley is perched just above the stairs roughly there, the plate glass window over there overlooks the busy street below. This helps to both constrain and direct the fight scene. This is also a reason to write the index cards - so that they can be arranged in a rough, conceptual relationship to one another.<br/><br/>Yet a third reason is as a pacing mechanic. One each detail has been used (and most would probably only be used once, although I don't know if or how I would enforce that), you have a strong case for saying the fight is over.<br/><br/>Of course, the mechanic would have to be embedded within a wider game to function fully - but a) I haven't written that game yet and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> if I had, this would no longer be a Little Ideas thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181798/#Comment_181798" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T17:35:23+00:00" title="December  5, 2008  5:35PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea of pacing a combat based on when all the props have been used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181856/#Comment_181856" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-06T07:26:35+00:00" title="December  6, 2008  7:26AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>What's to be gained with ANY front-loading of such facts? </blockquote>\nBecause <i>I </i>say there's a teapot there, then <i>you</i> say that you scald someone with the teapot's hot water.

And collaboration is a large part of what roleplaying is about.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In a previous game we played, scenes and locations were in part established via <i>background music</i>, which seems like it would fit with this idea here.  Specifically, the background music was phrased as the scene wanting the PCs to do something weird (be scared if the music is eery and weird, be violent if it is background music for a fight scene, etc.)  Establishing an intangible would basically be the same as establishing tangible facts, though the use of those facts later might be a little different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181860/#Comment_181860" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-06T07:49:57+00:00" title="December  6, 2008  7:49AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a neat thought, and something I've been pondering recently, too.  There are all sorts of mechanical ways to do this and make it more interesting.  For example, I have this little thing I'm working on for <i>Beast Hunters</i> where you start out with a few details about the playing field.  If you describe a new detail in a maneuver, you get a couple extra advantage points for writing it down.  And then, when you're making tactical resources on the fly, you can get a big boost by combining two of the details into one resource.  Frex, in the tea house, you've got (1) the tea light under the pot and (2) a bottle of sake.  Combine to toss-and-light, and you've got a damage resource.  (I don't know if sake's high enough in alcohol to burn, but it's just an example <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So basically, depending on your mechanics, you can prepare some things beforehand and still add more throughout the fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/avram" title="avram"><img alt="avram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/n64KGLTEFAF9C.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/avram">avram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183847/#Comment_183847" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T22:25:49+00:00" title="December 16, 2008 10:25PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>There's a similar idea in <a href="http://www.adastragames.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=10411&amp;sid=913940b66b5a32f309d24421fbcf22c0" rel="nofollow"><em>Minimus</em>, the One Page RPG</a> (which has grown to four pages).

Then again, the system was simply "spend points to attempt actions. if you succeed you describe, for each of these elements you get into your description get points back" and then a list of things that went with the genre (mostly "explosions!" and "even bigger bad guys!") which gave you points. This list of permanent things-we-wanna-see was then expanded by a list where anyone could write something, usually a bit more specific ("a fight in zero-gravity" and "a robot falls in love" were among them, IIRC) which would give you points once and then get crossed out. Worked pretty well, for that kind of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
