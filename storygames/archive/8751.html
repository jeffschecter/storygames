It's the raw, unedited version, I'll do a text version and maybe an edited version of the sound sometime within a couple of weeks (w/ photos and all of that), and post the link in this thread. The sound is a bit crap, and the conversation is kind of meandering. We get into RPGs from 37 onwards (Play Unsafe, RPGs and improv etc). So this is not meant as a "check out our finished product"-post, but more of a "yay, I had this very nice conversation today, and if you're really, really interested in impro and RPGs, you can listen to the unedited version here: <a href="http://www.filefactory.com/file/af14f89/n/IMPRO_wav" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.filefactory.com/file/af14f89/n/IMPRO_wav</a> "                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193571/#Comment_193571" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-22T12:16:04+00:00" title="February 22, 2009 12:16PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great, Ole - thanks for sharing it.
