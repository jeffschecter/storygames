Since I wanted a lot of player buy-in and narrative input, I switched the setting from the standard \u201cFlash Gordon\u201d serial to The Day After Ragnarok.<br/><br/>\tA video I whipped together to help set the mood: <span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-G2x0ACCLywc?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2x0ACCLywc"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/G2x0ACCLywc/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/> <br/>We picked out our heroes: an Atomic, a Psychic Detective, and a Mystic.  Then I set the scene: the heroes are in shackles, being flown to a Soviet research base.  Comrade Zhukov mocks them, saying they will have a chance to witness the doom of the United States before they become subjects for hideous experiments in Science City 13.  The Patrol was captured trying to cross the Bering Straight on their way to\u2026<br/>\tThen the Previously Ons.  <br/><br/>\tBack on the plane, the players had to first defeat the level one \u201cCaptured!\u201d threat, and then three level one Red Guard threats who blocked the Level 2 Comrade Zhukov, all of whom stood in the way of a level two, three turn countdown, \u201cTake Control of the Plane!\u201d  A spawned threat from ignoring Comrade Zhukov became a Red Guard thrown through the People\u2019s airplane\u2019s flimsy hull, and the attendant rapid depressurization.  Failure to defeat the countdown in time spawned two fighters sent to investigate yelling heard over the radio.<br/><br/>\tGreat moments: trying to come up with the name of the gun Comrade Zhukov held on the characters.  \u201cI want to say Luger, but he\u2019s a Soviet.  Wait, no, it is a Luger!  I wonder why would Comrade Zhukov be packing a Luger?!?\u201d  Then, later, the spawned fighters became German advanced Luftwaffe planes.  <br/><br/>\tWe just started the Interludes when we were cut short by a new arrival, but it was a really fun session, and I think we\u2019re all pumped for more.  <br/><br/>\tBecause I can\u2019t leave well enough alone, I\u2019m still curious whether it wouldn\u2019t work well to leave some of the (+)\u2019s blank, and have them filled out during play as a simple advancement mechanism.  I\u2019d also like to see Keys ala Lady Blackbird and The Shadow of Yesterday incorporated somehow, perhaps with more Abilities being earned?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264919/#Comment_264919" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T11:21:58+00:00" title="April  1, 2010 11:21AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2x0ACCLywc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2x0ACCLywc</a><br/><br/>Awesome sauce!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf" title="Gavinwulf"><img alt="Gavinwulf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf">Gavinwulf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264950/#Comment_264950" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T12:53:13+00:00" title="April  1, 2010 12:53PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the play report, this is a game I'm really interested in and would like to hear more about.<br/><br/>Cool video too. It's amazing to me how the Nazis and WWII is kind of turning into it's own gearpunk setting/mythos/what-have-you.
