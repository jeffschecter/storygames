In the comics, Artesia regularly refills her Pools by indulging her sexual needs, for example.<br/><br/>So right now Im musing about Keys.<br/><br/>Im debating with myself wether I should make Keys based on the Tarot-like experience-system of the game, make cultural/religious Keys or a combination of the two.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any experience running Artesia with TSoY?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86925/#Comment_86925" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T08:24:36+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  8:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd do both.

One Tarot per character.<br/><br/>If you used Tarot and converted it to XP (instead of flat out advances), characters would never level up, it would take forever.<br/><br/>I was reviewing Artesia just the other day, actually (I was going to create a character for that "Create characters for games you haven't played" project). I started thinking of the Tarot in relation to TSOY's keys.<br/><br/>The problem that I think happens with Artesia, is that many of the Tarot's XP conditions are HARD. They may happen like ONCE in a 4-8 session scenario. Which kinda sucks. It means that many folks will min-max by choosing the weak-ass Tarot with easy XP conditions (I know I was looking at those).<br/><br/>But, the thing that I like about the Artesia tarot is that they are so archetypal. They all revolve around not one Emotion or Mission, but about a whole suite of archetypal conditions.  They also have a huge suite (sometimes 10 or 15) conditions that grant XP (albeit most of them are hard).<br/><br/>That got me thinking towards some sort of "Greater Key", if not "Tarot" for TSOY, where you can have 1, maybe 2 at one time, but unlike regular keys they have a larger number of conditions which reward you with XP (or perhaps instant advances).<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86947/#Comment_86947" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T09:39:26+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  9:39AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Youre right that some of the condition in the tarot-like Artesia system are hard to fulfill.<br/><br/>I should have clarified this actually, but what I was thinking about was taking the core idea of each "card" in the tarot-system and making a Key based on what it represented.

So if we wished to emulate that, the Tarot-keys should have both conditions where you gain experience and things which you may spend it on.  Admittedly, this could be a guideline rather than a list ("Spend these advances only in ways that reflect your instinctive approach to the physical/manly dominance of society/destructive urge..."), though personally I would be tempted to convert all the Artesia gifts into TSOY secrets and use the lists as-is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97067/#Comment_97067" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T03:19:04+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  3:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy,<br/><br/>Just an anecdotal.<br/><br/>I played Artesia for some time, and it was possible to get between 10 and 20 XP easily each session (disregarding the publicity modifiers, which we only used once), as all the Tarots are always accessible for you to draw experience from. Bookkeeping this is a bit hard (see the extended example in the book), and we changed to rewarding XP at the end of a session; Our GM made a little booklet for everyone to jot down what XP they got for what part of the game.<br/><br/>When the game became a bit more free-play and less rules-application, appropriation of XP slowed down a bit, but the rewards came in in bigger heaps (meaning: We got more of the big rewards).<br/><br/>On a whim, in a TSoY/Known World Mashup, I'd use the Tarot XP system as-is[1] and let every character have one drive/passion, being signified by a single key that'd work the same way as in plain TSoY.<br/><br/>[1] I'd probably drop the limits on where to spend XP/advances, as there's not enough frills on a TSoY character to make that distinction very useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
