This was going to be titled "I was happy with traditional games" but as I wrote it I realized that wasn't a reasonable conclusion.  The post got very bloggy but I decided to still hit "submit" because it was a lot of work just to figure out my own thoughts.<br/><br/>Before I tried story games I liked GMing traditional games but was starting to hate D&amp;D, even D&amp;D as-I-fixed-it (E6 and Raising the Stakes).  Even my own traditional game (Legends).<br/><br/>Prep took too long and didn't always give me what I needed for the session.  I would spend ages prepping and campaigns would die because the next session spent too long getting ready.<br/><br/>I felt strangled by other peoples' copyrights, and felt like everything I had to do needed to be new and fresh and unique.  If I started with something inspiring I felt like I had to write it out of my game as quickly as possible rather than enjoying what inspired me.  But I loved other peoples ideas, and especially their art.  I had tons of unused gaming material on my shelf.  When I wasn't trying to be completely unique and original I'd start trying to write massive documents that would put vanilla fantasy stuff into more open licenses so that people like me could play with it.  I'd lose interest because trying to write vanilla on purpose and avoid inspiration from other things is incredibly boring.  When I posted my own campaign ideas online, and people said "cool!" and gave me some ideas for how to make it even better, I deliberately didn't use them because I didn't want to be a hack.<br/><br/>Character creation took too long and didn't tell me what I needed to know from the player.  I didn't understand that tyrrany of choice was a problem.<br/><br/>I was trying to be responsible for everyone's fun.  I narrated too much.  I wanted to be able to GM relaxed or standing up and walking around, not just stuck to the table keeping track of numbers.  <br/><br/>I had to organize the people to show up and was really bummed when they bailed even though I know deep down that gaming means more to me than it does to them.  I stopped gaming for dumb reasons like being self-conscious at the venue.<br/><br/>I wanted my game to have a simple base that I could add all sorts of stuff to.  I knew coupling was bad in a system for reasons of fun.  <br/><br/>I didn't know how to balance being better at possible things with being able to do impossible things.<br/><br/>I wanted play to be faster; much, much faster.<br/><br/>My game was always in development.  I wanted to stop designing or sampling games and just settle on how I liked to do things and run that until I died.  I wanted to share that with some people who could understand what I was talking about.  I wanted to be able to say "Hey, I'm thinking of doing this, this, and this in my next session!" and have people jump up and down and say "Cool!  Keep it up!" or "Nice!  I want to play in that campaign, when is it?" <br/><br/>Mostly I still feel the same way.<br/><br/>I do feel like I've learned a few things:  IAWA showed me how to prep fast in a style that I grok.  Red Box Hack's movement and damage systems are exactly what I needed to bring those two things in line with the rest of what I like in my own game.  I'm getting a better idea of how to do character creation so it tells me what I need to know about characters, and how to get characters to be defined the way I need right out of the gate.<br/><br/>But the biggest thing I've learned is that I don't want to be a game designer.  I don't want a ton of criticism, I don't want my game taken apart and rebuilt and fixed and improved.  I don't want to figure out what criticisms come from misunderstanding rules and which ones come from understanding them and not liking them, or sifting out what criticisms come from clashes of expectations or from very wise people who can see my game isn't delivering.  I don't want a dressing-down of what I'm doing wrong in my actual play or how I need to talk tough with my gaming group.  More than anything, I realize now that I wrote and advocated for E6 and Raising the Stakes just to try to create a community of people that understood what I liked in games so they knew what I was talking about when I asked for help.  Trying to playtest them, beyond my gaming group, and leaving the rest of D&amp;D alone was a mistake.<br/><br/>All I want is some help in getting a few of the pieces to fit together, and some support and encouragement for how I can make things even better at my own table.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129642/#Comment_129642" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T02:54:22+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  2:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>I wanted to stop designing or sampling games and just settle on how I liked to do things and run that until I died.

I've had 15 years experience with writer's critique groups and have learned several things: 1) seek feedback only when you're ready, 2) seek feedback from a group you feel comfortable with, and 3) learn to filter out the ego-challenging comments anyway, they'll still show up.<br/><br/>Good critique is a skill, but listening to critique is also a skill. In a public forum like this one or the Forge, the quality of critique you receive will always be open to wild variation, so you still have to learn to filter it. I'm sorry, that's the truth. It's part of being a creative artist.<br/><br/>I will speak up in defense of the Forge. I've participated in it for 6 years and posted some of my game ideas. At no time did I feel ripped into and much of the feedback and response was invaluable. Ron and Clinton do a pretty good job overall of keeping the environment there productive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129658/#Comment_129658" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T05:27:38+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  5:27AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Alan.
