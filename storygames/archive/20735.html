The game is said to be swashbuckling, and it's a game that made the players describe their actions, mostly by combining skills with each other. Someone could combine Close Combat with Acrobatics, but had to describe the action to include both skills. Anything went, Knowledge: taverns could be combined with anything, as long as the players described the actions. It was a "roll first, describe later" kind of game.<br/><br/>I never had professions or classes in that game. Instead, I tried to make the players think in specific patterns by providing a life path so they could think up a profession for their characters. It went well when it was fantasy but when I did conversions to other types of games, like one with an apocalyptic setting, people had a harder time to understand what they could play.<br/><br/>So my first draft yesterday to change the skills into professions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455550/#Comment_455550" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-09T09:11:35+00:00" title="August  9, 2016  9:11AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2016 10:27AM by Rickard.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The setting takes place in a huge fantasy city, where the buildings are so tall the lower regions are set in dusk, sometimes darkness.

The attributes are broad and should cover what adventurers should be able to do or know. I google translated them so the words can be a little bit off.<br/><br/>The professions are meant to be broad as well, where the player can use any profession for any roll, as long as they can describe it. They include theoretic knowledge, practical use, and opens up for knowing people in the city that can relate to that profession.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455551/#Comment_455551" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-09T09:17:24+00:00" title="August  9, 2016  9:17AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2016 10:15AM by Rickard.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The trouble I'm having is that, in the old version, I had skills that were broad but could be narrowed by combining them with other skills. You could fight with all kinds of weapons, but if you combined it with Animal Wrangling, it made you into an individual. That's how I made the players describe their actions, and every roll they did told something about who they are.<br/><br/>I like the basic idea of having skills be professions which helps the players to understand what they can do in the city. There are more professions than what the players can choose from, but these are relevant to the scenarios they are about to play. But can I use the same thinking of combining skills (now professions)? Should I add something else to the mix, like character traits, so the players need to take those into account when rolling?<br/><br/>Perhaps I should just shut up, not worry, and playtest instead? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But when I look at these professions, I cannot see any good combinations. I want the players to be creative in their descriptions, and it's possible that these design ideas are bad for what I want to accomplish. (I should perhaps not base each profession on an attribute, but leave the players to do the combination themselves.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455552/#Comment_455552" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-09T10:18:42+00:00" title="August  9, 2016 10:18AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, wait...
