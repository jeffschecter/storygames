It's nice to read a landscape PDF on-screen.<br/><br/>There are some very cool things about your implementation: I personally think that the "trait ladder"--that chart where traits can progress in severity and/or "duration"--is the "killer app" of your game. It's a really neat and (potentially) easy way to make both negative and positive "fallout" work.<br/><br/>I don't know if you're looking for proofreading feedback, but: watch out for your use of apostrophes. It's/its, words that should have them (because they're possessive), etc.<br/><br/>Have you played this yet? It seems like a lot of work to put into a game if it's not playtested... Then again, a lot of us do the same thing.<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure I could work all those mechanics without some more examples, but that's hard to say without actually sitting down and trying to play through it. There are a few things here and there, though: the main one that jumps out at me is that you say to "pick a risk" several times in the text, but there's no obvious spot in the text where it explains what that means. Does it mean to name (beforehand) what negative trait you could develop as a consequence of the action?<br/><br/>Also, I like the three categories, but it sounds like sometimes you roll just to gain a positive trait, right? In that case, some won't necessarily apply. For instance, let's say I'm grabbing some weapons from a weapon cache, to gain the trait "Armed". Would we have to roll for this? If so, what's "the risk"? And I probably don't care about it being observable (unless I'm planning to sneak into somewhere, of course).<br/><br/>There are a lot of cool mechanical bits in here, though! I like how you've tried to cover every angle of what happens in play with solid, consistent mechanics.<br/><br/>If you (or anyone else) has played this, I'd like to hear how well it works! I enjoyed looking through it a lot.<br/><br/><br/>ETA: Two quick comments!<br/><br/>1. The "simple" format is actually easier to read, it turns out. The layout makes more sense (e.g. having the flowchart-style pictures next to the text which refers to them). However, the font is so thick that it's hard to read without zooming all the way in. (I could read the "nicer" version without doing that, for some reason.)<br/><br/>2. Ghost/Echo uses a mechanic that is a simplified version of Vincent's <i>Otherkind</i>. I don't know if you realize this (you don't list Otherkind as an inspiration), but your game's mechanic is much closer to the original Otherkind rules than Ghost/Echo. Did you just accidentally reverse-engineer that game? That would be funny.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274896/#Comment_274896" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T15:00:25+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  3:00PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1km1kt is running a contest called the "Cyberpunk Revival Project", it's been going for a couple of months and finishes up at the end of June. I had a game in the works, but was finding that it was getting a bit too unwieldy and cumbersome (there was a 30 page upper limit in the contest and I couldn't find a way to strip my 40-odd pages down any further without losing some really valuable play examples and other explanations). So I decided to expand on a simple concept rather than cut back a solid one.<br/><br/>This is what I ended up with when I recycled the images from my previous game, had a couple of days spare time and some ideas bubbling away in my head.<br/><br/>This will be my new entry into that contest.<br/><br/>It's been roughly playtested, and I've verbally explained the concepts out to a few people to get some feedback; but I haven't had a proper playtest of the combined mechanisms yet. That should come this week.<br/><br/>My agenda for posting it here was basically to get some gut reaction feedback, so thanks for your questions and comments Paul. I knew there were going to be a couple of aspects that I'd missed in my rush. <br/><br/>With a 30 page upper limit, I've got room to add a page about "picking a risk" including a play example on this can be done. I guess that sort of thing just slipped my mind and probably would have continued to slip my mind as a text artefact, due to being explained away verbally during playtesting.<br/><br/>I know what you mean about the font being hard to read on-screen in the simple format; I had a fresh look at the pdf when I woke this morning. That will be amended in the revision (hopefully to something that retains the current feel...or maybe something that reflects it even better).<br/><br/>As for Otherkind, I'm very familiar with them as a mechanism, and you're probably right that these should be used as a inspiration. I've blogged about Otherkind dice (<a href="http://vulpinoid.blogspot.com/2009/05/game-mechanism-of-week-21-otherkind.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://vulpinoid.blogspot.com/2010/05/vector-theory-18-filters-mirrors-and.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), and I had them in the back of my mind, but I didn't intentionally reverse engineer them back to the source. My reverse engineering was actually based on the "<a href="http://vulpinoid.blogspot.com/2010/01/vector-theory-1-new-weekly-blog-series.html" rel="nofollow">Vector Theory</a>" of game design that I'm working on, and an attempt to explore a specific aspect of that through a deliberate game design choice. <br/><br/>Once or twice during the rapid design process of this game, I had second thoughts about the "Degree of Fallout" as a mechanism. This is something currently under consideration for my next revision, I'm thinking of using this aspect of the otherkind die allocation in a more general form. I'm thinking of expanding it, such that...<br/><br/>[1-2] = The GM/Oracle introduces a story twist based on the outcome of the event being resolved (or the Orcale regains a secret if they choose not to introduce this twist) <br/>[3-4] = no new story twist is added<br/>[5-6] = The Player introduces a story twist based on the outcome of the event being resolved (or strips a secret away from the Oracle if they choose not to introduce the twist).<br/><br/>It's also been pointed out that in a lot of revenge tales, there is a sniper or someone so skilled in combat that they can often slay a victim with a single strike. The system as it stands has trouble with that type of situation, so I'm thinking of incorporating a "success carry-over rule". Where a sniper can prepare her shot, building up successes (but potentially acquiring more sacrifices and fallout), then release the successes with a final decisive strike that pushes a victim up and across the necessary grid points to remove them permanently with one bullet. <br/><br/>Other than that, it seems pretty robust.<br/><br/>Proper playtesting will tell me if this is an illusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275492/#Comment_275492" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T06:32:02+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  6:32AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An updated full version has now been added to the site (now with play examples to hopefully clarify some issues).<br/><br/>An updated lite version should be available shortly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275499/#Comment_275499" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T06:45:14+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  6:45AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Google Doc high res option leads to an error, page not found.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275615/#Comment_275615" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T14:12:21+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  2:12PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's annoying, I'll have to remedy that ASAP                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275812/#Comment_275812" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T09:42:21+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  9:42AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strange, but I really prefer the greyscale version layout &amp;
