You've got heavily armed vehicles travelled dangerous stretches of highway linking fortified cities. You've got massive autoduel arenas in every city and a nation dueling circuit. There are high-tech corporations and gritty motorcycle gangs. But the game doesn't always deliver on that setting. I've got some ideas to fix that.<br/><br/>Here are the principles:<br/>- Use a "say yes or face the highway" model. To get the important stuff done, you've got to take it to the road.<br/>- Take a major urban area, maybe the one where you live. Use a Google Map as the reference.<br/>- Sprinkle it with factions: corporations, civic authorities, dueling teams, and gangs<br/>- Each faction has ties to physical locations: corporate headquarters, the fortified downtown core, home-turf arena, a stretch of highway<br/>- Each faction has ties to one or more road-ready combat forces: a sponsored dueling team, an ace agent in a tricked-out van, police interceptors, and so on<br/>- The characters are all members of an up and coming dueling team<br/>- They've all got relationships, rivalries, and ambitions that tie them to people in other factions<br/>- These relationships go in and out of the arena: maybe they've got to take highway missions to make ends meet, or a rival corporation is arming a bike gang. Other times it\u2019s about their performance in the arena.<br/>- For individual fights, use Google maps as the base to build battle zones out of your local landscape <br/><br/>Each session, the GM prepares a set-piece battle (or maybe a few encounters). Then we role-play for a while to find out how the character's relationships are developing and establish what they're after. Then we take it to the road to find out how that works for them. One week it might be a drawn-out highway battle as they deliver a high-priority passenger to City Hall. Next week might be a shootout at the mall. The week after might be divisional semi-finals in the home arena.<br/><br/>I\u2019m working on some concepts for maps, like taking Google Maps images of actual geography, then overlaying the salient features (using <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2008/07/map-making-tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">John Harper</a> techniques). <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/neighborhood.tif" rel="nofollow">Here\u2019s the street in front of my house</a>. It\u2019s pretty primitive, but it conveys the idea. That took my about 45 minutes to do, but I could now probably pump out several in a row for a whole street battle.<br/><br/>This is all working from stuff in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9194&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Car Wars</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9293&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Making Car Wars More Awesome</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207700/#Comment_207700" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T23:59:04+00:00" title="May 15, 2009 11:59PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet.

Depending on your tastes and your group, you could probably just sit down and brainstorm a few factions together. All you really need to get started is a few facts about each faction, like their location and goals. Making maps is potentially a lot more work, but you can cut a lot of corners using the Car Wars highway tiles and arena maps, or just drawing out an arena on a map sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207754/#Comment_207754" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-16T20:19:02+00:00" title="May 16, 2009  8:19PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2009 8:28PM by tony_dowler.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chugging along...

My favorite is Pitch Car (Carabande).  For those of you who don't know about it, there's no math, there's no dice, no turning protractor thing, and the rules are maybe a page long.  You set up this big wood track where some edges have a wall, and then you take turns flicking wood disks around the turns trying to carrom off the walls without falling off the track.  For some reason this game excites me like you'd think being in a race car should.  It's got all the elements of risk (hit too hard and you'll fly right off).  It's definitely not sim, but fun as crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, with all this Car Wars hubbub lately, I break out my old deluxe box set and look through it, but groan.  God, the math.  I'm so sucky at math.  And my son's kinda interested, cause he likes cars and likes to blow stuff up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I take the pitchcar disks (any wooden disks would do and we tried several different types and size) and I make some quick weapon templates (spread for a flamethrower, smaller spread for machine gun, dowel for a cannon, etc).  Then we use the kitchen table and throw some boxes on it (those are the buildings..you know the Ritz Cracker building, Cheerios Complex, etc).  And we take turns flicking our cars around the "arena" and manuevering around each other trying to get within template range.  We had a blast, but I'm not sure if that's cause it was good, or me and my son just can have fun with cracker boxes and wooden disks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWent real simple with the weapons and rules.  Everytime you hit another car or a building, you lose an armor point (our cars never had more than 6).  If you fall off the table, you stalled and sit there a turn not being able to do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried to do a road scenario, and that worked ok, but the pitchcar sections are not super easy to take the back one off and add a new one on.  I would want to make some sections out of foamboard or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...to sum up, when considering a combat mechanic...consider the finger flick.  Very fun.  If you are all thumbs, you are screwed though...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208017/#Comment_208017" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T14:31:33+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  2:31PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Codexier</cite><br>So, I take the pitchcar disks (any wooden disks would do and we tried several different types and size) and I make some quick weapon templates (spread for a flamethrower, smaller spread for machine gun, dowel for a cannon, etc).

I'm assuming Car Wars as the battle mechanism right now, but it doesn't really matter. It could be 4E D&amp;D for all it matters.<br><br>Characters have a bunch of traits that tie them to world, other characters, and reward certain (cool) behaviors in combat. Traits have a checkbox. When it's open, you can check the trait for a re-roll. When it's checked, you have to use another trait to clear it. Skill traits give you a re-roll to do something you're good at, like shoot, drive, or repair. Motive traits are goals and relationships tied to bangs. You can check them when they matter to the battle at hand. Style traits let you clear other checkboxes when you do cool stuff.<br><br/>So, for example, here's Damon Warrick, veteran road duellist:<br/><br/>Skill: Crack shot: check to re-roll shooting or damage dice<br/>Motive: Find and take down the leader of the Blood Skull cycle gang<br/>Style: Speed junkie: clear a checkbox if you're going 65 mph or faster<br/><br/>There can be bonus temporary traits used as story rewards (or as bribes when the GM declares something). Traits clear after a fight and can be used again (or maybe only some clear until you go back to your base and get a night's sleep).<br/><br/>On top of this, I'm throwing some stunt rules, for doing everything not covered by the rules. Shooting stunts require an appropriate to-hit roll. Driving stunts require an apporpriate control roll. Other stunts are a roll against a difficulty set by the GM.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
