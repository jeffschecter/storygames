I'm a good friend of Neko Ewen, who introduced me to this site as I also like to come up with variants and add ons to games at times, and that's what brings me to my first post here:<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, Neko Ewen sent me a link to his discussion regarding having music play a larger role in a game.<br/>\nUnlike his concept, where there would some sort of tie in to a specific soundtrack or set list to a game, I almost immediately came up with a game where it encourages more "personal ownership" in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere it is:<br/>\nEach player brings a small number of varied music tracks ahead of time (like 3 or 4), and during scenes that require some sort of test of skill, a player can choose one of his tracks to play during the scene and describes what the character does to resolve the issue. The other players (and possibly the GM) vote on the players concept of the resolution, and the appropriateness of the music to the task and/or the resolution. <br/>\n<br/>\n(I.E.: Joe has to get past a female secretary and into an office. He could play a track of slow romantic music to try to seduce her, he could play a track from "Metal Gear Solid" to sneak on through or play some kind of mischievous/sly music to explain he's a courier here to pick up a package that happens to be in the lockable closet right behind her.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on his choices, the other players then vote, each using a token of some sort that indicates if they liked it, didn't like it, really hated it or really liked it. (I'd imagine the "really hated" and "really liked" votes are finite per session to avoid serious griefing) and is then tallied.<br/>\nThat could be it or the voting adds a bonus to a die roll afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially, the music tracks are used like trump cards to help highlight the scene, but it requires a little spreading out as the players shouldn't know what the adventure is before hand. Wild hard rock or uber death metal might be great for heavy action scenes, but you'd be a one trick pony as that kind of music wouldn't help you in a scene where you have to sneak and investigate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also had the idea that each character could have a theme song that could be played once per session (the other music, to avoid rehashing can't be played more than once) that would allow some near super-human/supernatural items to be worked in to the scene resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best story setting concept I had to make use of this mechanic was that the players are group of young people in the modern day who can use/generate music to allow them to do incredible things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, waddya think sirs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115421/#Comment_115421" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T15:14:53+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  3:14PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like the perfect addition to a "cinematic"-style game. Obviously this wold work good with Primetime Adventures, because you have already bought into the tv-show idea, so having theme songs for characters and mood music fits right in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can also add a lot to your narration. Just because you say something is scary, doesn't mean it is. Add some creepy music, and the other people at the table get he mood right away. Likewise, if you say, "my character is pretty suave when he talks to the nurse at the ER," and everybody else is like, "uh-huh, suave, sure, suave like how?" but if you cue up some Barry White, everybody gets it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMovies use music as emotional cues, so you know how to feel about what you are seeing. And it works pretty good, too. So moving that over to gaming shouldnt be too hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nVoting for a bonus is good too, as it reinforces genre in a play group.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut music is sometimes a sensitive issue, so you don't want to bust this out with people who hate each others' music.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115473/#Comment_115473" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T22:41:54+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 10:41PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, make sure no one's judging each other's taste in music.
