I have this idea for a one on one horror/haunted house rpg. It has a bidding mechanic to deal with the one big problem that plagues the genre: Why stay in the house? Now this is controlled easily enough in fiction. But in a rpg with player meta game knowledge, well it's harder to make them stay. I propose a Meta game solution. A system in where the player gains "earned" dice for allowing the GM to "describe" them into more peril. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave the player hear a noise in the basement. Open the basement door? Yes. Here is a die. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you go down the stairs in the dark to the light switch at the bottom? Yes? Very good, here is a die. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are standing in a pool of light on the bottom stair. You flip the light switch the light flares for a blinding moment, then burns out. But just for a second you thought you might have just seen....something there way back in the back by the old coal chute. Do you feel your way back there?.....and so on.<br/>\n At any time during one of these bidding scenes the player can just say no.  And it goes back to the normal flow of an rpg. The "earned" dice are very important in that they are used for two things" First they are useful as bonus dice. But also they can be used to buy cards during end game. I was going for a set number of scenes in a game. With a defined end game. with one of three possible outcomes. Escape, Insanity or Death. Perhaps using a blackjack type end game.....and that's all I got.  Seems like a lot of Meta game in there, almost board game like. Oh and the game system is designed with semi-incompetent PC's in mind. <br/>\nWell what do you think Sirs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119064/#Comment_119064" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T19:50:06+00:00" title="January 10, 2008  7:50PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            William, I like this.

Like, you can get another scene (and another chance to earn more bonus dice) if you <i>do something really stupid</i>.<br/><br/>Like, I might think to myself: <i>OK, that was the last scene; the psycho killer is lying on the living room floor with the knife sticking out of his chest. I suck on bonus dice, so I know when he springs up in the end game and attacks me, I'm screwed. I need another scene so I can earn more dice.</i> So I say, "OK, one more scene. Now that the killer is <i>obviously</i> dead, instead of running out of the house and calling the cops like a normal person, I just throw myself down on the couch and start crying!"\n<blockquote>Another thought I had was to allow more than one player but only having one main character the focus of the haunting if you will.

If you take a look at the sources I was "kind of" using, The Haunting movies, The Innocents, King's, the Shining and to a lesser extent Rose Red; and the Novels that these movies were based on. A common formula tends to appear. 1st Introduction to, and Infatuation with, the "bad"place, 2nd Exploration of, and the first taste of unease.  3rd Mystery and the stakes are raised. 4th Followed by revelation and things quickly getting out of hand. Death does not typically occur until the 4th phase. But there should be some element of danger well before then. <br/>\nAnd yes the GM must buy end game as well. But if the player can buy end game she might get to set the final scene or something like that? Perhaps the "Horror" has not gained enough power to fully manifest, if the PC buys end game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119082/#Comment_119082" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T21:25:59+00:00" title="January 10, 2008  9:25PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gloomhound</cite>But in a rpg with player meta game knowledge, well it's harder to make them stay.</blockquote>\nI'm curious about this statement.

A tool if you will that allows the placement of the PC's in situations that are correct for the story.  True players are usually more than willing to go into the basement, in numbers and armed with 12ga shotguns and night vision scopes. But that is not what happens in movies and fiction. Also a theme of horror can be about the loss of self/self control. This is something I was trying to add to the mix somehow. And lastly this is a game that I'm kind of targeting towards the spouse/girlfriend as player, and I know my wife would not go in that basement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119089/#Comment_119089" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T22:40:22+00:00" title="January 10, 2008 10:40PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gloomhound</cite>Death does not typically occur until the 4th phase.

So, for example, opening the door might release a foul stench that reduces the character's "Stomach" stat for the remainder of the scene; going down the dark stairs might result in a step breaking, reducing the character's "Flee!" stat until treated; flicking the light switch could provide just enough light for the monster's "Medusa Petrification Power" to cause a Polymorph Savings Throw. You get the idea.<br/><br/>That way, the risk/reward isn't on the meta-game level of "the players are smart enough not to walk into my traps, so I have to pay them to be stupid." The risk is a chance of mechanical penalties in exchange for the consistent reward of bonus dice. I leave the percentage chance of penalties as an exercise for the reader, but any probability less than about 90% is going to be a good enough "deal" to a min-maxer that you ought to get some Huckleberries....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119132/#Comment_119132" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-11T09:49:37+00:00" title="January 11, 2008  9:49AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  I think another idea that promotes "Staying in the house" is ultra-quick chargen. Like maybe this is a game that needs character classes. But instead of "traditional" character classes, you have horror film stereotypes, like:<br/>\nPanicky guy<br/>\nWhenever he wants to perform an action he rolls 2 dice, unless he runs away, then he rolls 3 dice, unless he runs away and into more danger then he rolls 5 dice<br/>\n<br/>\nGhostbuster (could be classic type or crazy ghost whisperer like the lady from Poltergeist)<br/>\nWhenever he wants to perform an action he rolls 2 dice, unless they are explaining the phenomenon, then he rolls 3 dice, unless their explanations make others lower there guard or stay in the house, then he rolls 5 dice<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are more, but you get the idea. People can grok these characters and play them at the drop of a hat. And if they get eaten, making another char is a breeze. I'd say the only real barrier then, is introducing them into the narrative...<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck man,<br/>\nDave M<br/>\nAuthoer of Legends of Lanasia (Still in Beta)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119139/#Comment_119139" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-11T10:45:33+00:00" title="January 11, 2008 10:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that random inherent risk is a really good idea.

I think it would be cool if each of the player's "stats" was an individual character (ie. Dumb Jock, Nerd, Popular Girl).  Each could be used for different tests, or limit your options/give bonuses for dealing with certain tasks.<br/><br/>Let's say the task is "go down the creepy stairs into the basement". I could lead with the Jock whose Bravado would protect me from from fear tests, but it would also increase the chances of not noticing the weak stair that will break.  If I choose to lead with a more cautious character, I'll notice the stair, but might lose my nerve.<br/><br/>It would also give the opportunity for escalating tension.  Each scene could end with the death of a character, allowing the endgame to be a classic "loan survivor vs the menace" moment.<br/><br/>I don't know how much of that is useful, and how much diverges too much from your vision, but I hope it helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119201/#Comment_119201" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-12T07:15:05+00:00" title="January 12, 2008  7:15AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of good stuff here.

The house will gain power the longer the player is in the House making endgame ensured by the 4th phase, but the sooner the house can start endgame the better the chance that it can "get" the player. Even though the House is feeding off the player and becoming more powerful, the later end game starts the better the chances are that the player can find the answers she needs to survive the House.

Be it that you simply can't stay any longer at the place and you have to flee, or you just loose your mind and remain in the couch shocked and unaware of your surroundings. Something relating to the Insanity End Game, I suppose.<br/><br/>2) It can also work as a kind of Possession Defense. The lower your score is, the easier it is for the entity to "possess" you.

Originally it was intended to be an competitive game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351516/#Comment_351516" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T17:29:03+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  5:29PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man I keep coming back to this time after time like a tongue that finds a void left by a missing tooth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351524/#Comment_351524" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T18:52:29+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  6:52PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, necromancer of lost electrons, what do you think of John Wick's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yesterday's Tomorrow</span> and its peril mechanic?<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351615/#Comment_351615" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T20:41:32+00:00" title="December 15, 2011  8:41PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To tell the truth I'm not familiar with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351619/#Comment_351619" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T21:13:13+00:00" title="December 15, 2011  9:13PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2011 9:14PM by stefoid.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random ideas:<br/><br/>1) you could make it a competitive game - be the lone survivor, or the lone escaper<br/>2) they always split up - that should defiantely be one of the stupid things - <i>what was that? you wait here by yourself while I investigate by myself.</i><br/>3) People often do try to escape, but they inevitably get caught.  If you are going to get bonuses for being stupid, you could also have penalties for being smart - like when trying to run away.<br/>4) This game should be character driven though, if its a cert that nearly everybiody is going to end up dead.  So its how the characters react to wahst going on and to each other that should be the focus.  I think archetypes, each of which has certain abilities unique to their archetype, some of which are aimed at each other, could work really well in this format.<br/>5) One of the other reasons people dont try to escape at least initailly- is the slow boiling frog.  Things manifest in degrees and at first - <i>Is this really happening?</i>  By the time they realize its deadly serious, its too late.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351649/#Comment_351649" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T07:08:17+00:00" title="December 16, 2011  7:08AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I feel like you should check out Jonathan's <em>Geiger Counter</em> while you're at it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415306/#Comment_415306" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-02T20:50:04+00:00" title="June  2, 2013  8:50PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I keep returning to this like a tongue seeks out a missing tooth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415340/#Comment_415340" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T09:34:45+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  9:34AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool ideas here.<br/><br/>At first blush, it seems to me you could have a complete game using blackjack as your sole resolution mechanic.<br/><br/>The player's moves are:<br/>When you expose yourself to greater danger, take a hit.<br/>When you take a stand or dig in to endure what's coming, stay.<br/>If you bust, you are brutally slain.

I have notes for a B-movie game that I abandoned some time ago. Anyway, my focus here would be to emulate horror movies/novels.<br/><br/>  First thought - a definite end state in the end phase; that is to say: the game can't end until the third act ( or fourth or denouement or whatever). If a bad roll ends the game in the first act, it doesn't emulate the fiction.<br/><br/>  Second thought - the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">players</span> should be rewarded for bad moves by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">characters</span> to simulate the tropes of the genre (" I investigate the noise outside", "I go down to the cellar by myself", etc.) These moves could be in the form of cards that suggest actions or attitudes/attributes (dauntless, stupid, flirty, drunk, etc). They might also trigger a Doom track that propels the game forward to the end-state. The more the characters do, the more "powerful"/plot immune they become but the quicker they reach the last act. A balancing act between gaining the resources needed while holding off the end-state. <br/><br/>  This says nothing about the mechanics of the game in regards to what the actual resources are or how they'll help; but we haven't addressed what type of game it is: rpg, board, card, hybrid, co-op, competitive, one character or many.<br/><br/>  I would like to see a system that accommodates the lone Lovecraftian scholar as well as the slasher teen blood fest. More replay value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
