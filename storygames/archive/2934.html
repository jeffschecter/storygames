Earth blocks Water. Metal slices Air. Like that.<br/><br/>Except I think almost everything beat Air and Metal, the way I dreamed it. <br/><br/>So anyway, the character sheet had a kind of pentagram on it, where the five points were the elements and the lines between them were arrows that pointed toward which elements they beat, creating a big star... and each point was a circle you could put chips in to show how strong you were in that element... though I don't really know what being strong in that element would do for you -- maybe let you win in a conflict you'd normal lose (like Earth turning around and beating Fire, or something) or the number of times you could "play" that element in a conflict, per session, or something.<br/><br/>I don't know what the bloody point was, but it looked cool in my dream-head, and I don't have time to think about it right now, or do anything about it, so I'm putting it here for now.<br/><br/><a href="http://random.average-bear.com/img/sheet.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="sheet.png" height="399" src="http://random.average-bear.com/img/sheet-thumb.png" width="400"/></a> <br/><br/>Click to embiggen.<br/><br/>It would also work that the element-conflicts that 'crossed' the pentagon were ties, like Fire &lt;-&gt; Water.

You could go clockwise around the outside for the cycle of creation (metal creates water as dew, water as rain creates wood as growing trees, etc.) Clockwise along the lines of the pentagram, it's the cycle of destruction (metal destroys wood by chopping it, etc.) Counterclockwise around the circle is the cycle of love, counterclockwise along the lines of the pentagram is the cycle of fear.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
