Stickin' it to the Man.)<br/><br/>All this talk of traditions in roleplaying has made me reflect on some of my experiences playing roleplaying games, and, by coincidence, my favourite film of all time: "The Barbarians."<br/><br/>Here's a very representative clip:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pAlJXkFBw&amp;NR=1" rel="nofollow">Part 5</a> (Note that the action starts thirty seconds into the clip, if you're short on time. All you need to know is that these two "barbarians" are walking into a tavern with some girl they just met to buy weapons.)<br/><br/>Please raise your hand if you have never played a session of a fantasy RPG that didn't look exactly like this, paying special attention to the dialogue, general scenario, acting and accents used, strange little details (does that snake make any more sense than the bargain the dude suggests?), the way the three handle various challenges, and the little conflicts that seem like they might be important but are totally glossed over (like the girl getting kinda pissed that she's being thrown into the bargain without her assent). <br/><br/>The parting line from the girl's character in the very end, as they head into the harem, is priceless. Note the expression on one of the barbarians' faces in return. I'm sure I've seen that exact face in reaction to a line like that at a table many, many times!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ola%20J." title="Ola J."><img alt="Ola J." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ola%20J.">Ola J.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266497/#Comment_266497" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-10T17:04:42+00:00" title="April 10, 2010  5:04PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            that clip is awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
