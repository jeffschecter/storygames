Unstore should probably have a consistent way to contact the individual authors, considering that it's supposed to be just a standardified sales interface for individuals instead of a store. The commerce is between individuals and Vincent as the Unstore maintenance man doesn't really take any responsibility for anything except the website tech. This doesn't really work if the site provides a means to send money to somebody but not even minimal indentity information for them, though - it's a pretty empty statement that Vincent's "not responsible" if he's the one hosting Paypal buttons that send money to mystery destinations without providing any disclosure about the identities of the publishers involved. What if somebody sneaks in a bum Paypal link that does really send money to an Internet scammer?<br/><br/>Of course Paypal sales imply a contact, as Paypal accounts are associated with email addresses. Unfortunately Unstore seems to use "hosted" Paypal buttons, which means that the account address is not obtainable from the system. It's up to luck and a given publisher's diligence whether a way to contact them exists for the Unstore customer.<br/><br/>As for Graham, it's inconceivable that he'd be ripping off Rasmus here. (The sole reason this needs to be said is because of how Rasmus framed the OP.) Much more likely that he's on a safari somewhere and hasn't just read his email for a few days, or he's managed to lose the order. This is generally the case with indie fulfilment, you just need to find some way to contact the guy to remind him about the obligation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_394149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394149/#Comment_394149" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T03:51:14+00:00" title="October 21, 2012  3:51AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To back up what Eero said, Graham was at the London Indie RPG Indiemeet yesterday.

The customer of the time resided in France, and I have in fact discussed this with other publishers and discovered that holy moly, the French post office is apparently so unreliable that if you have enough French customers you might actually have to have a separate policy for what to do about those lost parcels. I've no idea what they do there, do their post office eat books or what.<br/><br/>My general advice is that if you don't get something you ordered from the Internet, most definitely be in touch with the seller at first opportunity. As a direct-order publisher and occasional retailer myself I know that 95% of the time the reason for the delay is either that they (I) forgot to send it, or that the mail monster ate the package. Neither of those problems is actually going to resolve itself unless you contact the seller and ask about it. I at least won't bite if you do!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_394171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394171/#Comment_394171" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T06:58:04+00:00" title="October 21, 2012  6:58AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">@The_Magus</a> who smoked your money away?

I sent a second copy (this is international priority mail, which is supposed to be higher class and deliver anywhere within about 10 days). That didn't arrive for 6 weeks. I was about to send a third when two weeks later the first arrived.<br/><br/>The other time it was to Denmark. There was an issue where for some reason, even though I confirmed the address of the user, the local post office delivered his mail to some old location (???), a location I had never heard of but was known to the buyer and apparently their post office. Rerouting order, perhaps?<br/><br/>I also watched an express mail package held in German customs for 10 days for no apparent reason (tariffs, etc), the user got the USPS EMS number and called German customs, and they immediately released and delivered the package. No idea why.<br/><br/>Was this shipped and received within the same country, or are you in a different country from the sender? If so, where?<br/><br/>Within the US, I've never had this happen. I've been shipping Media Mail, first class, priority mail on well over 3,000 items (games, eBay, etc) and to me knowledge I've never had a single package go missing, much less having two packages in a row go missing.

It's a nightmare.<br/><br/>Reasons I've found in the past: differences in address formats between countries, customs returning packages for a variety of reasons, packages being lost in a workplace's internal mail.<br/><br/>Reasons that we'd never know about: packages being left on doorsteps and being stolen, packages being left in strange places by a well-meaning housemate or spouse and found months afterwards.<br/><br/>Add it all together and, eventually, you stop worrying about it and accept that sometimes packages need to be resent.
