If you're interested in testing or offering feedback I'd appreciate it. I need more testers. Since it is kind of a strange alchemy of traditional and non-traditional play, I felt I'd ask here and see if anyone is interested in helping make it clear, concise, and playable, without any significant rules change. (There are a few, but mostly just making things have a certain clarity.)<br/><br/>Here is the mailing list for initial feedback. If you are interested:<br/><br/><a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/HSSHRPG/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/HSSHRPG/</a><br/><br/>Later on in the year when more of it together we can discuss bits of it here, or elsewhere depending on preferences.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
