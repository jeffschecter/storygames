Christopher Kubasik (or CK! as he is known to us local to him) asked for clarification and I gave an answer.  Then I thought about it and thought about it some more and finally decided I wasn't happy with that answer.  So I came up with a better one I figured was worth its own thread.<br/><br/>In the other thread the issue of a cop worrying about being "reckless" came up.  As I thought about it I would be fine with "Am I reckless" within the context of say, a car chase, but would be totally uncool with it while searching a crime scene.  Similarly I would be cool with, "Do I turn my brother in to the police" while the brother was there pleading with you not to turn him but I would not be cool with that if your character had simply stumbled across evidence damning him.<br/><br/>The key for me is the *presence* of a conflict of interest between characters even if the Stakes don't directly resolve the conflict at hand.  So I had to give some careful thought as to why that is.  The answer has many many layers it turns out.<br/><br/>One layer has to do with social vulnerability.  Quite frankly I consider using cards to resolve a character dilemma made in the absence of confrontational pressure to be an emotional punt.  Such scenes are opportunities for me to see what you (the real player) actually think of your character and his predicament.  What kind of man do YOU think he is?  The kind who would turn in his brother?  Reckless?  Scenes without conflict are where the real players layout where they stand on the fiction and they demonstrate that through their character's baseline behaviors.<br/><br/>Another layer has to do with the nature of conflicts.  Conflicts are not, in fact, simple Yes/No propositions.  When a conflict arises there are many many things that could happen.  Sorcerer addresses this by breaking conflicts down into action-by-action exchanges and so the richness of the ever changing situation falls out via the flow of roll over dice and the like.  But PtA resolves everything in one go and so that richness has to come from somewhere else.  I say that somewhere is the High Card player.<br/><br/>Let's look at car chase.  There are many things we could be interested in.  The most obvious is who wins the chase?  But there are tons of other things going on.  Is the cop reckless?  Are any civilians hurt?  Does anyone get killed?  Do the bad guys hand off the goods mid-chase?  It's pointless to enumerate these things in advance of playing cards because they are (a) heavily dependent on the fictional context and (b) are going to be different from player-to-player depending on what their investment in the scene is.  This is why "story boarding" can become poisonous so fast because it's attempt to negotiate all the answers to these questions up front and you lose the benefit of System.<br/><br/>Going from there the player who's character is actually involved in the conflict gets to fix one "question" so to speak in place.  In another words he publicly *announces* where his investment is in the scene, after all it's his character on the line.  But this "fixing" comes with a risk.  In order to *guarantee* part of the outcome you've got to risk not getting it *at all* hence, Stakes.  But one way or another that one element becomes fixed after the cards are drawn.<br/><br/>That fixed element then becomes the focusing point for the High Card player to answer all the other questions.  Not only does he decide the answers but he decides what remaining questions are relevant based on his own criteria.  At *this* point negotiating the remaining outcomes becomes functional because the System has elected a dedicated editor AND fixed a creative pivot point around which everything else revolves.  You can negotiate all you want but the buck stops with High Card.<br/><br/>So let's go to chase scene and the "Am I reckless?" Stakes.  Let's say you win and your character is not reckless.  High Card has an interesting choice.  Did your ability to control yourself cost you the chase?  Or does he cut you a break?  Let's say you lose.  High Card likes the idea that won the chase but you know what?  That recklessness got your partner killed in the process!  Or maybe you won the chase but your recklessness meant that failed to notice the bad guys pass off the goods.<br/><br/>There has to be in-the-moment, here-and-now opportunities for consequences that High Card to play with.  That doesn't exist in the quite moment of conflicted decision making scenario.  There are LONG term consequences, and major plot direction changes that happen because of them but not something High Card can narrate in as right-then-and-there fact.  Fixing long term situation elements into place before they happen is just as problematic as pre-negotiating all the outcome consequences of the Stakes.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169917/#Comment_169917" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T13:23:09+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  1:23PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 1:23PM by Jesse.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I forgot to point out is that if a particular player is chomping at the bit to get the High Card for YOUR scene he has to put his own bit of fiction "at risk" as well, since you can't play cards for High Card alone.

I was under the impression that anyone with fan mail to spend could throw a card in on either side of the conflict, pull the highest card, and end up doing the narration.  There's no "fiction 'at risk'" in that setup at all, as far as I can tell: he doesn't have to be particularly invested in whether his side wins or loses the conflict, he just has to have extra fan mail tokens burning a hole in his pocket.<br/><br/><br/>I should also add that the most interesting part of this thread so far for me is that it has the potential to move away from talking about what the people in the conflict want and move towards discussing what the High Card player <i>needs</i>.  All the woe and dismay generated by the whole "when do we have a conflict?  what kind of conflict should we have?" problem is worth talking about, sure, but it ignores the problems of the poor son of a bitch who -- whether he likes it or not -- has pulled the highest card and now has to narrate what happens next.  The post-conflict narration was often even more of an anticlimax than the conflict itself in our worst PTA games, and I sometimes wonder if there was a way to better foolproof it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169941/#Comment_169941" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T15:08:18+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  3:08PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 3:16PM by Jesse.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>Is this actually true, though?

That's an interesting point but that isn't my understanding.  My understanding is that the fan mail/card GOES TO the player on that side.  So that player would end up with narration.<br/><br/>Example: Player A spends a fan mail on Player B's side.  That ends up being the High Card.  Player B narrates.<br/><br/>Edited Note: Although even if what you're saying is true then at least it's costing you game resources.

I consider the High Card player exempt from Character Advocacy (like Stacked cards in Spione).  Character Advocacy comes in at the Stakes level.  So if the player wants to use the "flip a coin" method as long as the winning means the character does what he'd liked to do and failing means the character goes against his own better judgment I'm okay with that.<br/><br/>I'm not very fond of the "flip a coin" method for non-confrontational decisions because it speaks to a certain relationship with the fiction and character that I find... disappointingly detached... maybe.  But I don't think it's necessarily a socially broken or dysfunctional relationship.

I've played PtA many times, and I never feel like I "get it". I've had many conversations about it with a range of story gamers, but I've never heard the things you've brought up in this thread before. I feel like I've begun to "get it", though it still feels a bit vague.<br/><br/>I've always struggled with PtA's conflict system, because it actually does feel like a coin toss...<i>as long as I continue to not understand how to take advantage of the system</i>. <br/><br/>But what you've said here, it sounds like in the pilot episode, everytime a player gets the High Card, I could ask them a bunch of questions that orbit around the central (and resolved by the cards) question, to provide examples of what the High Card player has final (with some negotiation) narrational control over. Yeah, did the cop wreck the car in catching the criminal? Yeah, did he accidentally sideswipe his best friend's banana stand, ruining it? Did he get temporarily blinded by an airbag? <br/><br/>So it sounds like Stakes can focus on overcoming the Issue (which takes away narrational control over the Issue from the High Card player), or it focus on part of the resolution of the physical conflict and leave the Issue open for narrational play (yeah, you caught the criminal, BUT you acted recklessly, and sideswiped the banana stand).<br/><br/>Anyway, this all makes PtA feel much more richer than how I've played it. Keep explaining please!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172661/#Comment_172661" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T13:37:56+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  1:37PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay,<br/><br/>Here's another thing, I think people make a bigger issue (hehehe) out of Issues than need to be the case.  Every scene and every conflict need not be about your Issue.  (Christopher Kubasik and I disagree strongly about this).  You Issue is what your entire story arc over the entire season will be about.  You have time.  It's okay to have scenes and conflicts about other things.<br/><br/>I see Issue management largely a function of two things.  The first is the role of the Producer.  I think Issues are actually largely a Producer tool.  It's not the player's job to make his Issue an issue  It's the Producer's job.  The Issue is a target the player has drawn for the Producer to throw things at.  The Producer is still the source of adversity in Primetime Adventures which is why he *frames* every scene.  Players "set up" scenes with the whole Location, Focus, Agenda thing but the Producer always *frames* the scene which includes spiking it with adversity that hits the character's Issue.<br/><br/>The second thing is Screen Presence.  If your Screen Presence is 1 there's two ways to play it.  Either that character's Issue is NOT an issue or that's the best time for the Producer to hit the character hardest because he will likely fail setting up good material for later episodes.  Both concepts work.  However, when the character's Screen Presence is 3, the Producer is pretty much MANDATED to hit that character as hard as he can with stuff that hits his Issue.<br/><br/>If you're feeling "advanced" another thing you can consider is Screen Presence in *relationship* to each other.  For example, if Alice's screen presence is 2 in an Joe's 3 episode she might want to consider how her Issue brings Joe's Issue into the spotlight.  This principle applies episode-to-episode as well.<br/><br/>But don't over think it.  If The Producer targets the Issues with Adversity and everyone chooses scenes based on what kind of "flow" they think the game should have.
