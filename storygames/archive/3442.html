I know that a lot of the indie game veterans said they really liked the organic system, but I wasn't sure how well it was going for people less familiar with the games being offered. What I'd like to see would be an opportunity for GMs to pitch their games quickly so people know what the games are. That might be one to think about for next time.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77595/#Comment_77595" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T18:22:58+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  6:22PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2007 10:48PM by tony_dowler.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>Games did fill really quickly with old-timers.

So, this critique is good to hear, it tells us we need to find a way to make that information available. One thing we could do for next year is to have a sign/poster with quick synopses of the various games that people are offering to run - something about the game itself and about the scenario to be presented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77613/#Comment_77613" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T19:31:21+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  7:31PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I had a problem with my second session in that one player who had signed up on the wiki wouldn't have fit anymore because he wasn't quick enough with the chalkboard.  But another player bowed out for him, though I know that that player really wanted to play the game.  That was awkward and way less than ideal.<br/><br/>Also, when Session 3 finally came around, the one where I wouldn't run my own game and was looking forward to play in someone else's, there wasn't really much choice. I could have jumped in on Kin, but I felt like something more lightweight than a family drama and by the time I realized that everything else was full, so was Kin. And I believe Jake was ready to run PE or CDM if people were interested, but he's a homie and I can play that here with him <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  So I guess I did have two choices, which actually both went away because Jake decided to play Kin.<br/><br/>I am very thankful that James Brown stepped up and ran 1001 nights for us, and that turned out great.<br/><br/>It did seem like there was much more going on in the earlier slots, but I wasn't paying much attention because I knew what I was going to be doing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Liminaut" title="Liminaut"><img alt="Liminaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Liminaut">Liminaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77620/#Comment_77620" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T19:51:20+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  7:51PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>we didn't focus on getting the signups from the wiki onto the board and thus into reality.</blockquote>\nI heard a few people complaing about this.<br/><br/>For me this was a feature not a bug.

It meant that everyone was looking for food at the same times, and everyone was looking for games at the same times.<br/><br/>I sat down for every meal - literally <i>every</i> meal over the weekend with a different set of gamers.  That was great.  <br/><br/>I didn't notice any real issues with the board, although it does sound like stuff was filling up before people got a chance to find out what was which and who was where.  A possible solution would be to just say "No signups for 1:00 games until 12:45" although that might make it's own problems.  I did notice misuba on some of the later slots running down the open games and getting the folks who put it up to say a bit about each game.  If that happened before folks could sign up, that would be good.  That would also give organizers a chance to say "Also X and Y signed up on the wiki before, so there's only 3 slots open."<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77626/#Comment_77626" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T20:11:37+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  8:11PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that the dedicated meal slots (for those of us dorming it) was very helpful for setting schedules.  And having a designated meeting place for beer Friday night was great for connecting with others and socializing.<br/><br/>The "put your name on the board" concept was perfect for me who likes to make my decisions at the last minute.  But I can see how it might have been tough for those not familiar with what was happening or just a little slow on the draw.  And it was a little weird that the wiki "reservations" didn't make it onto the board.<br/><br/>My suggestion would be to emulate the wiki on the board each morning and put all games and attendees for those events as "tentative", maybe with parenthesis or in a different color.  Then at 8:45 each morning an announcement about which games were on the plate and invite people to fill the boards and perhaps move their names around as the mood struck.<br/><br/>But all and all I felt like the event organization was 85% there and it really worked for my tastes.

Yes, that's when the con is ;-)  In fact, I never saw anything like a schedule at all until two days before the event when I got one via email.  Was a schedule posted on this forum, perhaps?  I'm not what you'd call a regular, so I'dve missed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, it all worked out fine for me and I got to play fun games with fun folks.  But I think all the games I was in were someone saying, "Well, I could run this."  "Sold!"  So having flexible would-be GMs was incredibly useful, and made it all work out.  Thanks, flexible GMs!  (I'm looking at you, James Brown.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the walk-in issue, perhaps half the slots could be opened for the wiki, and the other half after the just-before pitch?

(Also, a huge thanks to P\xf4l Jackson for letting me in -- I hope I remembered the name right.)<br/><br/>That said, that was the first day and I was playing in the room next door during Session 1, so I didn't know when sign-ups happened for Session 2.  So, for next time, I'd say that if someone made sure when everyone was aware when games went up on the board, that would help out some of these issues.  I might also suggest that if a GM knows he'll have a certain number of "pre-regs", he'd advertise fewer slots or add them to the board when they add their game.<br/><br/>Also, the freeform method allowed me to advertise my playtest and put it up for Session 3 during the day of the con without having already put it on the wiki.

A sign-up sheet posted by the door listing the slots and the games would have helped players be more intentional about hooking up with each other in a desired game/slot.

Whenever I sign up for a game at a con with a lengthy planning cycle, I'm always wondering if the GM's energy has evaporated in the months between game proposal and the con. <br/><br/>To make things simpler, what about eliminating the idea of wiki signup altogether and forcing game announcements and player signups to happen at the event itself?   The wiki can still be used to gauge player energy, but it can be specified as non-binding.<br/><br/>If a GM wants to offer private player reservations, then the GM should take the burden of maintaining those private reservations and just write in those players' names when they put the game on the announcement board.  And if a game is entirely filled by pre-registrations, then the GM doesn't need to announce the game publicly at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77922/#Comment_77922" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T15:05:51+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  3:05PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a different but related topic, I think we should make the pre-game "towncrier" session more effective.

There is absolutely a place for the Open Source mode, but I can tell you that my con was disappointing from a players point of view.  I enjoyed the games that I played (thank you Paul and James) but I did not get to play anything that I went to GPNW to play.  Each time I saw something that I was looking for it was already full or conflicted with something that I could have been doing at another time.  A more fixed schedule would have alleviated this frustration for me.<br/><br/>I have a lot of convention experience with fixed slots and ticketing.  While it is more of a hassle, it does allow players (and GMs) to better ensure that they have the con experience that they are hoping to have.<br/><br/>While things worked fairly well with a small con (50 people), if we were to double in size, I think that the troubles would more than double.  <br/><br/>I would also like to see a couple of tracks implemented.  Most especially a StoryGames 101 track and a Try something new track.  This way there would always be at least one game for people new to the hobby (or at least the experience.)  Plus there are lots of new games out there and if the game is designed for newbies, then we can be sure that pre-gens or cheat sheets are available to enhance and streamline play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All that being said, it was great to meet everyone and I am just jealous that there was a lot of great stuff that I did not get to do.<br/><br/>--Brandon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77946/#Comment_77946" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T17:20:32+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  5:20PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Am I overcomplicating things if I think a mix of unconferencing and ticketed games would be optimal?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bolthy" title="bolthy"><img alt="bolthy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bolthy">bolthy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77947/#Comment_77947" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T17:24:00+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  5:24PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            New to the board, but thought I'd toss out what few comments I had regarding the scheduling. <br/>\n<br/>\n- As a disclaimer, I'm an indie n00b and most of my con experience is AmberCons. (Which are a very different beast.)<br/>\n- The wiki vs. whiteboard thing had me a bit confused. When I showed up I had no clue what was going on, I couldn't remember what Indie 101 game I'd signed up for, there were games on the white board that didn't really exist. Once I got past the initial shock, the white board made sense. Many of the games are well suited to just pick-up-and-go play so that wasn't much of an issue for me. But then, I got into everything I wanted so I didn't get burned by the system either. <br/>\n- That said, I do like the idea of being able to organize things more in advance. Perhaps you could have some stuff planned in advance with allowance for more pick-up style play at the con. <br/>\n- I definitely vote for longer gaming slots. 3 hours was fine for some games, but not nearly enough for others. <br/>\n- The meal breaks seemed just fine. But then, I didn't eat at the cafeteria. We either walked a couple blocks and ate at a pizzaria for lunch or drove somewhere else for dinner. <br/>\n<br/>\nWill you guys be doing events at any of the other local cons coming up?

You made this thing awesome.<br/><br/>Now for some less fortunate news, it's possible that Seattle U won't be an option next year. I'd like to know what kind of convention you'd still want to come to from these options:<br/><br/><b>In town but more expensive:</b><br/>If we hold it at a hotel in town, it's going to be a lot more pricey for walk-ins and overnight stays, but you still get that Seattle goodness.<br/><br/><b>In town, still inexpensive, but no accommodation:</b><br/>There are tons of nice venues we've found, but they aren't near Hotels. This means that people without other accommodation would have to pay for a hotel and travel to the con. Getting rooms at the same Hotel and providing some kind of transportation is an option.<br/><br/><b>Hotel in the outskirts:</b><br/>We can make it a lot cheaper by not being in Seattle proper. This probably still means the con will be more costly, but not by as large a margin. Seattle people could probably still commute. How sad would this make you?<br/><br/><b>Somewhere in the boonies:</b><br/>If we're willing to go way out, there are lots of options with off-season resorts, smaller hotels, and that sort of thing. This probably means that everyone has to stay overnight, but it keeps costs down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85788/#Comment_85788" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T10:24:21+00:00" title="August  6, 2007 10:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to be clear, Tony, you guys are $350 in the red?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85789/#Comment_85789" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T10:24:38+00:00" title="August  6, 2007 10:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: boonies, how about Olympia?

I'd still pay a bit more for that to be the case, but probably not enough more to cover the difference in costs between a dorm room and an actual hotel room.<br/><br/>Since I'm road-tripping it to any future events, out in the boonies is equally attractive as in the city, as it has fairly little effect on my travel convenience -- which makes me want to say that if you're going to go out to a distant suburb, why not go way out and make it more of a cabin/resort/camp nerdly kind of thing.<br/><br/>I think overall, the low cost was a major part of the appeal, but the event was awesome enough that I can definitely make room for a more costly version as well. Still, it was really nice to be able to drive down there for a weekend, and almost not have to worry about the cost due to the low overhead in terms of rooming in particular.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85986/#Comment_85986" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T17:39:41+00:00" title="August  6, 2007  5:39PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Portland may be a cheaper area to hold an event that sticks close to amenities (or at least to transportation).

We just had the annual Dragonflight convention in Seattle, and it was a good time to touch base with a lot of people in the West Coast convention gaming community.  A group I belong to came out of it with an offer to be in charge of role-playing game promotion, organization and coordination for ConQuest Northwest in February 2008.  RPGs are the area ConQuest NW really wants to buff up and showcase.  I pitched the idea of having a Story Games/GPNW lounge and it was well received.  Would the Go Play NW people be interested in getting together to brainstorm ideas for something like that?  At the very least, we could use it to promote the actual Go Play NW event and to spread interest in the community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87767/#Comment_87767" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-13T10:33:24+00:00" title="August 13, 2007 10:33AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to do that, and I think some of the others would be in too.
