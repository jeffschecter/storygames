Role Play heavy, rules lite version of the Serenity Game, based on Joss Whedon's Firefly and Serenity. Let me know if you are interested, or show up at Lost Goblin Games in Raleigh 7:30 monday.<br/>\n<br/>\n So here is the set up, roughly. <br/>\n<br/>\n It started with a mutiny aboard ship, then things went Tian Fuhn Di Fu. How were you to know when you signed on to the MakeMake (Mah'Kee Mah'Kee) things would go south so fast? The MakeMake is a Kuiper II Class Transport owned by Ivan and Josef Potemkin. Josef manages the family's small relocation and colony supply business out of Bernadette, while Ivan "the Terrible" captains the MakeMake. When you first met, they made it seem like they were the premier colony transport, but you soon discovered that that was a load of Da Chung Wu Dahn. When Ivan the Terrible expected a little Yee Yan once too often, the crew revolted.  <br/>\n<br/>\n You will play a new crew member on the MakeMake and determine its destiny. Will you join the mutiny and space Ivan, will you defend him from the mutineers and earn his respect, or refuse to G'en Ho Tze Bi Dio se?<br/>\n<br/>\n One PC is playing a former (Male) Companion now Steward type and Chief negotiator (domestic and charisma skills). We could use a pilot, engineer, cargo crew, doctor, tough, whatever. There are no specific requirements, but whatever might interest you. Try to imagine being on the ship for the long haul.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Steve (doctormalaan(at)yahoo.com)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177126/#Comment_177126" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T06:23:25+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  6:23AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you using the Cortex Serenity system (the one from Margaret Weis)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sol" title="sol"><img alt="sol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sol">sol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177203/#Comment_177203" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T14:14:37+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  2:14PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: James JeffersYou appear to be local (Raleigh, NC).

I've simplified the combat system somewhat. <br/>\nSo, yes for Char Gen. Skill use and such. And all the Chinese in the game!<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat will use an initiative free method (I read about that somewhere :) ) and have a more defense friendly system (one dodge or parry, covers all of your attacks).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
