One of the NPCs is Winston Q. Black, a kindly old man, owner and proprietor of <i>Something For Everyone</i>, a strange curio shop that reminds people of <i>Needful Things</i>.<br/><br/>Anyway, Winston Q. Black has a special move:  When you accept a gift from Winston Q. Black, he gains a string on you.  Mr. Black loves giving things away.  Zola the ghoul, who works at his shop wonders how he stays in business.<br/><br/>Right now he's got a total of 15 Strings on the player characters, and a string on the Chosen's NPC little sister.<br/><br/>So, what's he need all those strings for?  What nasty things should he be doing with them?  Any ideas for fun custom moves, for when Mr. Black comes calling in a favor?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406446/#Comment_406446" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-17T09:53:29+00:00" title="February 17, 2013  9:53AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you find out Winston Blacks true form and purpose he can spend a string to make you forget all about it                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406458/#Comment_406458" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-17T12:46:42+00:00" title="February 17, 2013 12:46PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could be a version of the Angel move spend so a big string spend, say '5' in order to do something huge, like a BtVS 'Superstar' style complete World re-write.<br/><br/>Use a Focus to rewrite The World.<br/>On a 10+ The World is completely changed while the focus is intact, PC's might notice a change each time they roll with Dark<br/>On a 7-9 Pick 2<br/>The PC's don't realise The World has changed until they Gaze in the Abyss<br/>The World has changed exactly how Winston wanted it to<br/>Winston still has possession of the Focus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406459/#Comment_406459" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-17T12:49:52+00:00" title="February 17, 2013 12:49PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2013 12:50PM by jda1974.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some ideas (though Praion's is already really good!):<br/><br/>* He can spend a string to make you reveal a secret at an inopportune moment.<br/>* He can spend a string to use one of your powers once as if he possessed that power.<br/>* He has a creature he is creating in the basement, a la Frankenstein.

Those already pretty well represent the sway he's got over the characters, and give him a pretty creepy vibe when he starts spending those Strings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
