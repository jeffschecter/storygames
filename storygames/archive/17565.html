(Needs a catchier name!)<br/><br/>I played the inhabitant, i.e. the person who comes up with negative stuff. I would often come up with new problems, trying to move the story forward. My counterpart tended to respond directly to the thing I introduced, playing it like a game of one-upsmanship.<br/><br/>I was the mayor of the main spaceport city of the Mars colony, and today Earth was stopping the subsidy of trade to Mars, despite all my protestations. The colony would have to be viable on its own from here on out. I dreaded making a big speech at the spaceport. But despite my ill-fitting suit (it's a new style!), the dust storm (you persevere!), and my terrible speech (the dust broke the microphones anyway!), I managed to get re-elected and even saved some money for the colony by botching the first payment to Earth.<br/><br/>The explorer scene went in a similar fashion, but in reverse. We decided he was basically human, but jumping in from another star system. He arrived in the system and spotted ships around the 4th planet, but his ship took some meteorite damage! He crash-landed safely, started getting angry alien messages over the radio. He struck off into the desert with a welding tool for protection, and got caught in a dust storm! But he followed some rover tracks back to a building...only to by stymied by a doorless wall. So he took shelter from the dust storm on the leeward side of the building, and eventually was confronted by armed guards...etc.<br/><br/>For the meeting, I had a hard time coming up with subjective stuff. We mostly insulted each other's appearance (including my dust-covered ill-fitting suit <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> ). We also had a lot of fun misinterpreting each other's language. E.g. "At first I thought this strange man was incapable of higher thought, as he kept repeating the same utterance over and over." "I had to keep asking these idiots 'what is your name? what is your name?'" The subjective requirement made it challenging, but fun. It ended when I ordered my guards to strip-search him...which he interpreted as a mating ritual.<br/><br/>For the Years Later part, we went on for awhile about the explorer fixing his ship's drive to get home, while I exploited him as a tourist attraction. Eventually we became friends and he married one of my daughters. This part took a long time, as the dice rolled low for us. After around 10 scenes we were getting ready to forget the dice and call it done, or lower the target number or something. We kept setting up events that could lead to death...only to have to play another scene. Anyway, eventually the political situation devolved and I was forced to run away, and decided to go with the explorer to his home planet. He left my daughter behind on Mars.<br/><br/>We took off and started sling-shotting around the sun. We watched the monitor together as Mars faded to a small bright dot. Then something went wrong with the hyperdrive just before the jump, and the explorer sacrificed himself by going out the airlock to fix it.<br/><br/>The end scene was me the Mayor, looking at the memorial of the explorer on his home planet, saluting, then walking on to the flagship of a huge fleet of ships taking off to conquer Mars. The Mayoralty shall rise again!<br/><br/>Play time was around 30 minutes I think. It might have been shorter but I had a hard time coming up with problems and scenes. Maybe just my state of mind that night, maybe because there wasn't much to go on. The other player was really quick to come up with solutions though! Also the dice pacing mechanic didn't work well for us, next time I would try reducing the number for each roll. Starting at 12, it would lead to about 6 or 7 scenes on average, and no more than 12. Overall it was a fun experience. Thanks Matthijs!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398280/#Comment_398280" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T02:01:00+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  2:01AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for playing!

Right now, I'm saving my energy for other things. I'm still self-conscious and demanding, which maybe means I'll return later with something wonderful.
