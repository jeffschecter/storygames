I had a great time and recommend everyone go if they can.  Terrific amount of energy across the board.  I ended up ditching out of most of my reg'd games because Games on Demand was a vastly superior alternative (and because of the ballrooms where the regular games were held, noise for G.o.D. was less and ventiallation a hundred times better).<br/><br/>Some comments:<br/><br/>Having read Bliss Stage, I now have a man-crush on Beh Lehman.  It hits so many tropes of the teens 'n robots genre that I've been interested in playing.  Wow!<br/><br/>I'm already scheduled to run Grey Ranks at my local con but after witnessing the great demo, it's clear Jason's game is shaping up to be something amazing.<br/><br/>Judson Lester ran a Poison'd game for us and I loved it (and I'm pimping it over at rpg.net)<br/><br/>I didn't get a chance to demo Steal Away Jordan so I can't comment.  To be honest, I think Julia dressing on Thursday in the garb of the setting and period made me uncomfortable enough not to want to play the game.  It was a decision that I regret now upon hearing that the game rocks.<br/><br/>Romping around with Don's Burning Blossoms game with Andy K. was a blast (and Andy -- you're a pretty cool fellow, awesome to finally game with you!)  Don -- you're my new fave GM; short actual play but you made a great impression.<br/><br/>Malcom Craig ran Cold City for us and he really is a rather great GM and world-traveller.  What a nice guy.<br/><br/>Jonathan Walton is so creatively smart it scares me.  We shared cherry juice.<br/><br/>Mike Holmes rocks. Period.  Ditto Joshua Newman.  Ditto Fred Hicks.<br/><br/>Playtesting Paul Czege's Niche Engine was a terrific experience.  The dude is from another planet and I want to live there.<br/><br/>Mountain Witch, PA was a fantastic twist on a classic game.  The meat packing plant on the side of the mountain has caused nightmares.<br/><br/>I regret not worshipping at Greg Stolze and Vincent Baker's feet and not meeting Judd; I kept on missing the dudes. Damn.<br/><br/>Loved hanging with Devil May Care and Alvin Frewer all con long.<br/><br/>I'm missing people and games...and I'm sorry to exclude anyone or anything.  I had no problems with anyone and all my games were extremely fun.<br/><br/>I bought loads of stuff, ashcans included, and I can't wait to play them.<br/><br/>It was very awesome meeting so many of you folks -- truly a great community.<br/><br/>I will see you next year!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
