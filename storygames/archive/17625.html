Both games have a dice mechanic which aren\u2019t 100% binary.<br/>In <a href="apocalypse-world.com" rel="nofollow">AW</a> you roll 2d6+stat, results: 1-6 failure, 7-9 partial success, 10+ success - With a failure or a partial success the GM makes his GM moves, i.e. dealing damage, taking away players\u2019 stuff. Thus, the mechanics often present a twist to the ongoing plot.<br/>Similarily <a href="http://perilplanet.com/fu/" rel="nofollow">FU</a>: You roll a d6 on the following table:<br/>&gt;6 Yes, and\u2026 You get what you want, and something else.<br/>&gt;4 Yes\u2026 You get what you want.<br/>&gt;2 Yes, but\u2026 You get what you want, but at a cost.<br/>&gt;5 No, but\u2026 You don\u2019t get what you want, but it\u2019s not a total loss.<br/>&gt;3 No\u2026 You don\u2019t get what you were after.<br/>&gt;1 No, and\u2026 You don\u2019t get what you want, and things get worse.</p>\n<p>With most results (except 3 and 4) there\u2019s also some twist to the story: the GM is allowed to introduce details (change of environment) or conditions (<em>\u201cknocked down\u201d, \u201cdazed\u201d, \u201cangry\u201d</em>).</p>\n<p>I was wondering if you can incorporate these kinds of mechanics into \u201ctradtional\u201d rpg systems (DnD, Warhammer, Savage Worlds\u2026).</p>\n<p>Vincent D. Bakers post about <a href="http://lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow">conflict resolution vs task resolution</a> comes to mind, as well as the stuff from Luke Crane\u2019s <a href="www.burningwheel.org" rel="nofollow">Burning Wheel</a>: find out about the players\u2019 intent, make failure interesting.</p>\n<p>Why am I asking?<br/>Yesterday we played a DnD3.0 session where we as players entered a tunnel system. There were two tunnels, we asked the GM if there\u2019s any difference between them but no, they both looked the same, smelled the same, whatever. Our ranger decided to test ability XY (dungeoneering or something like that) and failed. Result: Our party still stood there, no clue which tunnel to take and then arbritarily decided on the right one.<br/>Would there be a way to make this situation more interesting?<br/>Could the skill check made more interesting? Like: What\u2019s at stake is: are you able to use your skill XY without triggering a trap or something like that? I was pondering if you could \u201chack\u201d the AW mechanics to a d20 (1-10 failure, 11-14 partial success, 15-20 success) but that only works with low-level chars.<br/>Any ideas?</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbinc" title="jbinc"><img alt="jbinc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/106/nFRMKD4VH4ILG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbinc">jbinc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399337/#Comment_399337" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-02T06:10:51+00:00" title="December  2, 2012  6:10AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could that situation have been more interesting? Short answer = sure. It sounds like the GM could have thrown you a bone and described some minor differences in the two paths, otherwise why bother saying there were two in the first place? On the other hand, maybe he just wanted to get you somewhere and this was a way of him highlighting 'you aren't there yet'. <br/><br/>As far as changing the rules go, I'm no expert on DnD but like you say I don't think the numbers would scale well with AW mechanics. If you did do something like that you'd want to either scale them higher (making them tougher at low levels) or make them more 'fuzzy' (like if you get 1-3 lower than your target number, it's a "no, but..." or if you get 5+ higher than the target number it's a "yes, and..." situation.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399339/#Comment_399339" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-02T06:51:18+00:00" title="December  2, 2012  6:51AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2012 6:51AM by Rickard.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I normally play with if the roll is successful, the players describe what they do, and if the roll is unsuccessful the GM tells what happens. If the GM is the one who's narrating, it the description should be about why the roll is unsuccessful. It's better if it's something beside the whole situation that hinders the character. "No, because a bear is chewing on your leg" is better than "No, because you're to stupid to figure it out". People, monsters, items or other thing in the environment is usually funnier to use when the GM is about to tell the players why they fail. Because then the players got something to interact with so they can continue. Otherwise, they will stand at the crossways wondering what to do.<br/><br/>For this reason, I prefer "No, because" instead of "No, and/but".<br/><br/>But this demands that the players are more involved, and that the GM can adapt to the players descriptions. "Going right is bad luck for goblins, so we should head left", and the GM (who thought they would go right) changes the map to fit the players narration. I don't really see this as a problem, because the GM has to do it anyway in rule systems such as FU.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399345/#Comment_399345" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-02T10:04:33+00:00" title="December  2, 2012 10:04AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might use something based on the amount by which the target number is exceeded / missed. FATE has something like this: if you beat the target enough you get "spin" points which can be spent in the next round for a bonus.<br/><br/>So you could have beating the target by, say, 4 being a "yes, and". Maybe a tie or beating by 1 is "yes, but".

(That bit of bell curve is part of what makes it work.)<br/><br/>You could do this, though:<br/><br/>Roll 2d20. If both miss, you're screwed. If both succeed, you're golden. If only one succeeds, treat it like a 7-9 in AW.<br/><br/>That said, the dice mechanics are definitely not the issue in the scenario you're describing.<br/><br/>I recommend groups who want to investigate player authority and conflict resolution to play "The Pool" a few times. That's a good introduction.
