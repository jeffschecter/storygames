It has clever bits, but I do not see how it is ground-breaking or important.<br/><br/>Here's what I think is clever.\n<ol>\n<li> It explains what players do better than a lot of other RPGs. The general advice paragraph in "Concept", the "How to Speak?" section, and the "The other characters" section are well done.<br/></li><li> Three of the six pages of rules are on cards (15 events, 11 characters). This makes the game rather replayable, as players will draw different combinations of characters and events every time they play.<br/></li></ol>\nHere's what I think is lacking or problematic.\n<ol>\n<li> Perhaps it's just a matter of taste, but I find the whole surreal-but-serious thing to be too strange to play. The fisherman is dead. The island is sinking. Someone stabbed a seagull in the head with a needle. But some people like that, so let's move on.<br/></li><li> Inelegance. The game requires a die but it's actually only used to select a player on certain rules on cards. Easier: just put everyone's character card in a pile, shuffle, select one.<br/></li><li> There's not much game here. Maybe that's a feature, but I want more structure. I want more mechanics (not necessarily <i>crunch</i>) to make the game do what it's supposed to do. The rules boil down to: pick a character card, then take turns drawing event cards and talking in character. There's a little more about facts and lying, and the event cards do lend to the surreality that seems to be the goal of the game, but I'm left feeling like there's a lot missing here.<br/></li><li> Specifically, there's no resolution system. I don't mean a "who wins this conflict" because there's really no conflict in the game (and that is at least interesting -- at worst, problematic; I suppose there might be conflict between characters, but the game offers no way to resolve these other than narration on top of narration). The game lacks a procedural resolution system. At any point, I can say anything at all and it becomes a fact of narration, so long as it doesn't contradict anything else already in the fiction. There is no way to say, "No, that didn't happen." It's basically like a live improv show: <i>yes, and...</i> <br/></li></ol>\nIs any of that ground-breaking? I don't see a single thing. I've seen short experimental games that did similar things for many years. Hell, I wrote a two-player hostage negotiation game that has no resolution system, but it has more structure. I'm not saying I'm clever. I'm saying that lots of people have been experimenting with stuff like this for a while. When did Magnus write this? If you say 1996, then I might agree it's ground-breaking. If you say 2005, then I'm not seeing it.<br/><br/>Tomas, please take this discussion as both a challenge and also as a polite debate. You made quite a bold claim ("THE most important game the last 10 years") and I want to talk about it. I don't see it. I'm willing to listen and consider other views here.

You may read a game and state that it does not appeal to you, but that's it.<br/><br/><b>Until we sink ...</b> (original: <i>Inntil vi synker ...</i>) reads as a very simple game. However: it is very carefully written, in a language that supports the drama the players are meant to be creating. And the method makes you play this game different than classical role-playing games, with greater ease and a more effective focus, without shedding the principle of "one player - one character".<br/><br/>Robert: the writing support the strangeness of the drama, and the way it is supposed to play out. I am not sure if the translation does the same, but I hope so. I don't think Magnus have any objections to "silly", but the game is better suited to a low-key surrealism, in my view. I would recommend playing it with 4 or 5 players though.<br/><br/>The game is simple.  It solves the conundrum of making effective GM-less games based on cards. And it has a higher than average replay-value for these kind of games (games with set theme).<br/><br/>Shortly after playing the game for the first time, I tested the method in a design of a political farce: <i>No danger, the plane is crashing!</i> It created a totally different kind of game, but the method functioned very well.<br/><br/>Magnus made a new game on the same method too: <i>In the Belly of the Whalefish</i>. That is another gem, an high adventure-game more fun to play than "In a Wicked Age", in my view. And again it shows that the method is very strong.<br/><br/>Then I tested the method in a social-realistic drama: <i>Autumn of Life</i>. Once again the method functioned, and once again it created a new kind of drama. This time the method facilitated one of the strongest dramas I have ever experienced in roleplaying games, a game on death and friendship.<br/><br/>From this testing and these inspired designs I gather that the game is indeed a jewel of extraordinary brilliance! I seldom do praise games other than my own, but <i>Until we sink ...</i> deserves every scrap of praise I can muster for it. After this game there is no turning back for me as a designer: I have to make games in this format!<br/><br/>I do not care much for the theme of the game, but that doesn't come into the equation. With the risk of being boring: this game is THE most important game-design the last decade!<br/><br/><i>You may find the game, translated, in the blog N\xf8rwegian Style, here: <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/37/" rel="nofollow">Until we sink ...</a>.</i><br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179735/#Comment_179735" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T06:36:19+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  6:36AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I get it either...Thomas, when you say "the method" what exactly are you referring to? That game play is only the conversation between characters after events have happened or the drawing of cards with fictional events on them? The first we Danes call "narration scenario" (my translation from "fort\xe6llescenarie"), and I think one the first of its kind was a Fastaval convention scenario titled "Jisei" from 1997, so the idea has been around since the mid-90s. The card drawing thing has been seen in many variations in quite a few convention games as well from 1993-4 (I used it in one of my own scenarios in 1995, except it wasn't cards but prewritten paper notes).<br/><br/>How are conflicts between fictional characters resolved in Until We Sink? How would you say that it's not "just" a dramatic exercise but a story game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179742/#Comment_179742" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T07:38:19+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  7:38AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2008 7:49AM by komradebob.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A quick question:<br/><br/>How, physically, did you play this game?<br/><br/>When I played, we did it as a tabletop game. My feeling was that it would have worked better ( and was perhaps intended) to be played as a small group LARP game, with some minor atempt to set up the veranda area where the scenes take place. When I say simple, I mean perhaps just some chairs set near each other in a row all facing the same direction. The final scene then is quickly restaged with the chairs now facing one another more or less in ths shape of a small boat.<br/><br/>Am I interpreting the idea correctly? It seems like that minor bit of change, and the move away from a table top game like I played would seem to alter the feel of the event dramatically.<br/><br/>Per: For my part, I haven't seen or played similar games, so it was an eye-opener for me. I'd posited that such games <i>could</i> exist, but hadn't seen one fully made and refined.<br/><br/>Do you feel there is any important distinction between "dramatic excersise" and "story-game"? If so, what does that distinction do that is positive?<br/><br/>Tomas: I can see the low-key surrealism you're talking about. It does feel a bit like a Twilight Zone episode or Twin Peaks. There's a sense of menace about it and discomfort even, especialy with the verfy unknown quality of the event cards. Even as the players attempt to create a pattern that makes sense out of the events, every succeeding card seems to undermine that explanation and force a reformulation of the pattern, all this taking place against the backdrop of a slowly ticking deadline that the players are clearly aware of but the characters are only vaguely threatened by until events come crashing to a head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179747/#Comment_179747" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T09:09:56+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  9:09AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2008 9:39AM by Per_Fischer.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert, I'm interested in what the game does - how it works, described in words.<br/><br/>With regards to your question, I see drama (and thus acting as such) and story games as two distincly different things. I'm sure there are overlaps and that you can use some techniques from one in the other. I'm not interested in acting at all - I'm not good at it, and I'm still to encounter a fellow gamer that's good at acting. Drama doesn't interest me either.

The topic of my game was the Lovecraft novel Temple, and I used a GM and several decks, but otherwise it's the same. I had more texture in my game as regards the procedure of play - players could do some minor things in the submarine they were stuck in and such - but the basic interaction between the cards, the players and the setting was like this. Interesting convergent evolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179756/#Comment_179756" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T10:22:48+00:00" title="November 22, 2008 10:22AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>Are the Norwegian rules available online somewhere?</blockquote>\nYou can find it, and the other entries from the 2006 R.I.S.K. competition, <a href="http://home.broadpark.no/~msollien/RISK.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179757/#Comment_179757" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T10:32:39+00:00" title="November 22, 2008 10:32AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2008 10:33AM by komradebob.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero:<br/>In broad outline, that sounds a bit like <i>Grace Under Pressure</i>, an old CoC adventure from Unspeakable Oath magazine that had some parlor larp staging suggestions.<br/><br/>Actually, another Unspeakable Oath adventure, <i>In Media Res</i>, could probably benefit from a re-take using something similar to <i>Until We Sink</i>.

In each scene, all the characters are gathered on the porch/veranda/thingy, and players talk in character. Something like this:<br/><br/>Matthijs: "So, dr. Higginsworth - what do you think is the reason for the strange noises behind the barn this morning?"<br/>Per: "I think it must be a wild moose!"<br/>Matthijs: "Hum. Hum. Doctor, have you been at the rum?"<br/>Per: "I might have been, if it hadn't mysteriously disappeared during the night. Don't act as if you didn't know!"<br/><br/>Which means that the question about conflict negotiation procedures is kind of... well, beside the point. The characters don't really try to make things happen - they talk about things that have happened, and sometimes try to convince each other of their version of the truth. <br/><br/>The atmosphere is an important part of the game. It's pretty subtle, and the game works best (IMO) when played subtly - although the advice about starting your character as a bit of a caricature is useful.<br/><br/>I'm not going to claim it's the most ground-breaking game around; however, it's very well written, and does what it aims to do in subtle, interesting an emergent ways.

Nonetheless, I disagree that I cannot offer an informed analysis of a game based only on reading it, without playing it. I agree that playing it is required to make a <i>full</i> analysis of a game, but without playing it, I can compare the reading of the game to the reading of other games I have played; I can predict how the game will play through syllogism; I can bring my <i>designer's</i> eye to the reading of the game. <br/><br/>Let's put all of my inexperience in playing the game aside, for that inexperience is <i>exactly</i> why I have started this thread. I have asked you to bring your considerable play experience to bear here to explain your praise of the game. Would you mind giving an example of play that demonstrates the genius of this game? I just don't see how the very minimalist rules produce play that I couldn't get in any other game, since nothing in the game seems to restrict or guide how I am playing.<br/><br/>I imagine that if I were to take the Sorcerer rules, for example, and put the characters on an island, and use bangs that resembled the events on the cards, that the conversations we would have in-game would be at least as fun/intense/entertaining as those we'd have in Until We Sink. You've played Sorcerer, right? Can you explain why your play with Sorcerer couldn't do what Until We Sink does?\n<blockquote>The game is simple.  It solves the conundrum of making effective GM-less games based on cards. And it has a higher than average replay-value for these kind of games (games with set theme).</blockquote>\nSo did The Shab-al-Hiri Roach, or other games before it, and those pre-date Until We Sink. Was this meant as an example of this game's ground-breaking qualities?\n<blockquote>And the method makes you play this game different than classical role-playing games, with greater ease and a more effective focus, without shedding the principle of "one player - one character".</blockquote>\nReally, this is what I'm trying to understand. How does it do this?

See, that's not something you are made aware of in the rules (unless that's a defining feature of the graphic novels that inspired the game, and that you would have had to have read those to understand this?). How did your player group know this?<br/><br/>So, to recap: it's conversation only, either about what has happened on the island or about the individual characters, but no conflict between player characters. All oyher possible conflict, like that coming from the event cards, are described in retrospect in these conversations.

It also grew out of a series discussions and a polerisation of the Norwegian design community centered on the forum rollespill.net. I don't subscribe to the design goals, and style of play this game advokates, but the game is a little gem. It is however very heavily based on an adult, consenting social contract. Some of you are asking for a conflict resolutions system, but this game moves that into the social sphere and says "lets not..." and then for it to work it trusts that we don't.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe usage of the word method stems from a long discussion on our forum about the usage of the Lumpley principle. It is Tomas preferd term meaning: "all the tools available to the players of this game, including but not limited to those in use." if used to describe actual play. Meaning: "the particluar subset of rules, advice and techniques used by this particluar text to produce its given form of play". He'll might swoop in here and correct me on these definitions, or even say that is not how he meant to use them here. The clue is that this little game found its own following and wasy quickly hyped to be <i>the shit</i> in our own little corner of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some of us like to speak in big words.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it groundbreaking, well among us it was, noteably because we developed the distinction between rules and suggestions (f\xf8ringer) as result of the conversations based on this game and others.<br/>\nMost important?

As a seed for that kind of theater, I like it. <br><br>As a game, I don't, mostly since for me it doesn't fall into the 'game' category. While there are a few rules, there are no mechanics, no system that in some way adjudicates action and result. As was mentioned before, this same scenario could be dropped into a game in a system and it could work, in which case it would be part of a game, but as it is I don't think it falls into my nebulous game category.<br><br>I guess what comes to mind to me is an improv scenario, like the ones on Who's Line. For example, one of their scenarios is about superheros. They take a situation suggested by the audience (similar to the cards in Before We Sink) and have the actors enter as superheros based on names drawn from a hat (again simiar to the cards) and they eventually reach a solution to the problem. If they aimed for surrealism instead of laughs, it sounds very similar to a session of Before We Sink. It's that similarity that puts it into the (cool, but not game) category of improv theater to me.<br><br/>What would make it a game? Perhaps conflict and a means to resolve it, some system to incentivize certain actions, maybe some way to quantify anything within the fiction. There's any number of ways to make this into a game, or to layer this fiction into a game, but I don't see it as a game in and of itself. It's a fun, slightly thoughtful improv setup, and I like it for that, but if someone asked for suggestions of games to play (the context in which it was originally brought up), Before We Sink wouoldn't come to mind for me.<br/><br/>I guess this similarity also adds some context to the groundbreaking-ness of Before We Sink. Improvisational theater of roughly similar structure dates back a few hundred years at least (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>), perhaps even thousands (some put the first commedia dell'arte in 200 AD). Who knows when writing suggestions on cards came into play, but it's been in play at least as long as Who's Line, which started in 1988 in the UK. This doesn't mean it didn't help rediscover the idea, or bring it to a new audience, but to me it sure seems a lot like improv.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180130/#Comment_180130" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T16:18:50+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  4:18PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, yes, this is what I'm saying. The way I define a role-playing game is a set of norms that guide and filter (restrict) input into a shared fiction. The players have a shared set of tools (those norms) with which to build a fiction.<br/><br/>I feel that Until We Sink offers some norms that guide player input but offers little to filter it. Nonetheless, those people who have played the game find themselves creating their own filters to make it work. Why do they create these filters? How? The text offers little to help here. Simply adding textual procedure that instructs the players to add a handful of restrictions of a certain kind would go a long way to making the text more RPG-like.<br/><br/>The game entirely lacks IIEE rules ("IIEE" is a step-by-step procedure for entering a fact into the fiction; let me know if anyone needs a clarification on that term). Rather, it limits the entire game to a conversation between characters, seemingly to prevent the need for any kind of IIEE / resolution rules. I don't think this works, entirely, especially without the text actually saying that players can't do anything other than converse. In fact, the game implies that the characters can do things other than converse, since it goes to great lengths to specify a working radio. Who can use the radio? Can the radio be sabotaged simply be narrating it? If so, does the first person to narrate such a thing get to do it unimpeded? What if they are interrupted by another player saying they protect the radio? How does the player group resolve this? Sure, they can "simply" work it out like adults, but now we're in the realm of make-believe or improv. These procedures for IIEE are part of what separates pure freeform make-believe from a RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180172/#Comment_180172" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T23:28:43+00:00" title="November 24, 2008 11:28PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see your point, Adam, but I think you're right in ending the thread; at this point, we'll just be discussing what makes an RPG an RPG, and nuances of difference in rules texts, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_180179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180179/#Comment_180179" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T02:39:26+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  2:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2008 2:41AM by TomasHVM.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sage: I've given up discussing what is and is not a role-playng game a long time ago.

It needs a group of concenting adults that buy into the low key surealism the game text promotes. For a group with strong established free-form techniques or a group with little or no set conceptions of what a rolepalying game is supposed to be like (noobs) the game does a very good job of communicating how to play it. For those of us with peestablished notions of what a roleplaying game should include (and the recent demand for IIEE prosedues is one such established notion) this game raises a few heckles. And thus the knee-jerk response: this isn't a roleplaying game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree with Tomas on his assessment of this game, I disagree with most of his 12 games to play. But it is his list. And then he should damn well use grand words to describe the games on the list.

The players have a shared set of tools (those norms) with which to build a fiction.</b></i><br/>\nThough it seems to exclude the Lumpley Principle if this just refers to the game-text. If the group sets down to follow the norms presentet in Until we Sink they have to use the norms of communication already established within their own group. their system to which they play.

I realize that intelligent people can disagree on the matter, and that I have a particular viewpoint and that others have other viewpoints. That's cool. I am interested in discussing those viewpoints like mature adults.<br><br>Tomas, lots of activities let us play a role. I don't think that's sufficient for calling something a role-playing game. I think "role-playing activity" is a superset of "role-playing game." I'm not even making an argument about "game," a part of the original definition that I think the hobby has long left behind. I'm just saying that what we have called RPGs for the last 30 years have certain qualities that set them apart from therapeutic role-play exercises, improv exercises and acting, and freeform make-believe. I'm happy to admit that the current crop of products published in the last five years has stressed and strained the traditional RPG definition (and raised the blood pressure of the RPG Pundit as a result, I'm sure) and that Until We Sink might be just another game pushing that envelope further. <br><br>At some point, though, the lines between improv and make-believe and RPG get so thin that the categories become useless. If Until We Sink is billing itself as guided make-believe or constrained improv, I wouldn't disagree. I also agree that the text looks and feels like an RPG but only the way a car without tires looks and feels like a car. On any cursory examination, it's apparent what the car is missing, and that the car isn't going anywhere, but that it's still trying to be a complete car (and failing).<br><br>Kaare, I absolutely don't exclude the Lumpley Principle. The problem is that the language uses "game" to mean too many things. In this particular instance, I meant a printed game text. I don't think it excludes the LP to say that a text must do the things that the LP-System must also do. I think if a text fails to do those things, it is not a RPG, but the group can add those things in the social contract and make it an RPG. <br><br>Is Until We Sink billing itself as "Instant RPG! Just add IIEE!"? I don't think so. I don't see in the text where it is trying "to guide these preset norms by its gentle mix of rules and f\xf8ringer," unless you mean that the reader is to make some pretty wide logical jumps by reading the text and guessing what the designer would do. I don't doubt that one can't play a RPG with this text, once one adds some necessary pieces, but I don't think it's complete, as written.<br><br/>Matthijs, I am indeed wary of this becoming a "is this an RPG?" thread, but as a designer, it's an important question to me. If it's acceptable to say, "You all know how to play a RPG. You don't need me to tell you how to resolve stuff," then can I write the following and it's an RPG?\n<blockquote>You're a team of magical warriors, wizards, and priests fighting monsters. Go role-play it!</blockquote>\nI'd argue that Until We Sink isn't much more than that. I do agree that the text contains some very good play advice, but I think it's not enough to actually play the game. It leaves some important questions -- some that it seems to raise itself! -- unresolved? I'm still curious to see answers to the problems I proposed in my previous posts. How does one handle the radio? Can the players disable it? How? What if there's a disagreement? Should the players just know that they can't disable the radio? Why is the radio there?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_180192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180192/#Comment_180192" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T05:58:24+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  5:58AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I'd argue that Until We Sink isn't much more than that.

What happens outside of these evenings is not played out, but the players can make up things that have happened and mention them in their character\u2019s conversation. (...)<br>The explanations for these events (both those on the cards and those you invent yourselves) are left to be established by the players through their character\u2019s conversations.</br></blockquote>\n<blockquote>A general rule: You say what your character says. Facial expressions, body movements and similar should usually be played out physically. You may describe your character\u2019s actions only when acting them out would be inconvenient or inappropriate (e.g. \xabI tip my drink over Mister Longbottom\u2019s head\xbb).</blockquote>\nNow for your questions.<br><br><b>How does one handle the radio? Can the players disable it? How? </b><br><br/>Players can make up things that have happened to the radio, and establish them through their character's conversation. Like this, for example:<br/><br/>Lisa: "Oh, Charles - could you have a look at the radio after dinner? It seems to be broken."<br/>Charles: "Certainly!" (Leaves the scene)<br/>Dialogue continues among other players until one more person has left the scene. Scene ends. <br/>Next scene:<br/>Charles: "Oh hey, Lisa, that radio thing? I managed to fix it, but it seems to be picking up some weird transmissions."<br/>Lisa: "What transmissions?"<br/>Charles: "I don't know. They seem to be speaking Chinese or something."<br/><br/>If they want their characters to do stuff to the radio <i>here and now</i>, they can act it out. I might, for example, lean forward and punch an imaginary object on the table - "there, that finished that damn noise! Who brought that stupid radio to the island anyway?"<br/><br/><b>What if there's a disagreement?</b><br/><br/>Between the characters? Display it through conversation, act it out if necessary and fun. <br/><br/>Between the players? Come on, we're all adults here. Someone gives. It's not a big deal if someone does something you don't like right now - use it as a springboard for your next idea. "Mabel! You BROKE the RADIO? That's it! I'm disowning you, Mabel!"<br/><br/><b>Should the players just know that they can't disable the radio?</b><br/><br/>...they can't? You're probably thinking that since there's an event card that states the radio is broken, the players can't break it before the card is drawn. Having the radio broken twice would, in our group, probably result in some smiles and someone incorporating it in a funny way. "Hey, everyone! I found another radio hidden in the basement!" "...Mabel, it's broken." "Oh."<br/><br/><b>Why is the radio there?</b><br/><br/>As a prop, an idea, a constraint... for the players to use. It's a gun on the mantelpiece. "There's a radio... It's our only connection to the outside world... that means it must break during the game!"                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180200/#Comment_180200" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T06:30:37+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  6:30AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2008 6:31AM by Matthijs.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kaare Berg</cite>I suspect that the reason this game is so logical to us from our own small design-thinktank is because of the exposure we have had to each others ideas in the prosess leading up to this game. </blockquote>\nOh, yes.

I am simply saying that I don't know how the game wants me to resolve certain things. I would play the game, but before I do, I'd like to understand the game better.<br/><br/>Imagine reading the rules to Monopoly. They're complete, except the rules for dice are left out. The dice themselves are included, so you know you need to roll them. The rules mention moving from square to square, so you know you do that, but you're not sure how. Maybe you've seen it played before, so it's obvious to you that you roll both dice, total them, and move that number of squares in a clockwise direction. To someone who has never seen the game played, however, it's a mystery.  To someone who has played other, similar, board games, it is less a mystery, since they can make some educated guesses, but they're still just guesses. Maybe you roll both dice and move a number of squares equal to the greater of the two dice. Who knows what the designer intended? <br/><br/>I get the feeling that your answer is, "who cares, as long as you have fun!" That's cool. But I'm not sure what will be fun. If I played Until We Sink with friends, I'd be tempted to take it beyond conversation. I'd want the characters to get drunk and to get into fistfights, to sabotage the radio and murder the other guests! The game doesn't tell me how I can do that if the other players don't want it to happen. Maybe the answer is, "you can't do anything that anyone else vetoes." If so, the rules could say that. Then it's 100% by-consent role-playing. It's not my bag of tea, but I know some people like it.<br/><br/>Tomas, it's apparent that you're going to poo-poo my opinions of this game until I've played it. I think I'm gonna try to get my play group to try out Until We Sink. I'm very curious to see what they do with it and what they find problematic, if anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180215/#Comment_180215" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T07:52:25+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  7:52AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, if I'm understanding correctly, I think it's more a case of playing a lot of Monopoly, then buying a new board game that doesn't have dice, nor any other way of randomly determing stuff. I don't think Tomas is saying 'Who cares, as long as we have fun,' more that an explicit system for resolving these conflicts just isn't needed, as they don't come up through shared consensus (apologies if I'm putting words in your mouth Tomas).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy background involved a lot of freeform gaming, as my university RPG club in New Zealand runs an annual con consisting of solely freeform games, very similar in structure to 'Until We Sink'. The scenario situations were generally engineered so that resolving conflicts with fists and the like just didn't come up, or could be dealt with effectively with narration (like the example of smashing the radio) - perhaps the scenario is a conference of heads of state, or the daily drama of a family, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers did sometimes describe punching another's character, and this got incorporated into the fiction but without 'mechanical' consequences - it just wasn't the point of these sorts of games, they did not solve the issues that the game was about and so became comparatively unimportant. By mutual consent, players tended to avoid the 'I kill him' kinds of conflicts, and the result has generally been very, very satisfactory - best games I've played in fact, and, as you say, at times very close to improvisational theatre.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did try more action-oriented games freeform, and interestingly these fell flat more often than not - for these, we really did need a way of resolving our character's physical actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really recommend you try 'Until We Sink' as written, ideally with a group of people not steeped in US-style indie conflict resolution (maybe a good one to try out with newbies?), and see how it works - certainly, on paper I was sceptical of these kinds of games but found they've worked like a charm in practice. It's one of the reasons a lot of current role-playing theory leaves me a little wary, since its emphasis on certain conflict-resolving requirements has gone against my actual play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180229/#Comment_180229" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T08:45:29+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  8:45AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adrian P</cite>I don't think Tomas is saying 'Who cares, as long as we have fun,' more that an explicit system for resolving these conflicts just isn't needed, as they don't come up through shared consensus (apologies if I'm putting words in your mouth Tomas).</blockquote>\nIf rules for resolving certain kinds of conflicts isn't needed because they're not supposed to come up during play, then why does the text not just explicitly say, "Avoid any situation other than talking, unless you want to resolve things consensually"? \n<blockquote>I really recommend you try 'Until We Sink' as written, ideally with a group of people not steeped in US-style indie conflict resolution</blockquote>\nWhy should this (people not steeped...) be a requirement?

What it's funny it's that I think that what made it so ground-breaking was the fact it applied the lumpley principle (even if I don't know if the author did know it). Something like the pool in indie rpgs american culture, maybe. It's much more a story-game than what was played there before, so I think it's really funny that you have problem with the concept. I think you should try to play something like "13 at the table" or "I want for nothing" sometimes...  :-)<br/><br/>Saying that it's not a rpg is foolish. The game build a shared imagined space where characters acts and with their decision create a story. I have seen forge games that strain the rpg definition much more than that. The big model it's fully applicable to the game, and I think it would be labeled as narrativist. Saying that it isn't a rpg because it has not conflict resolution rules is like saying that GURPS is not a RPG because it lack conflict resolution rules, or D&amp;D is not a rpg because it lack rules for falling in love. In this game you know that you don't try to kill other characters during the conversation exactly as you know that the GM should not say "ceiling drop, you are all dead" in D&amp;D in the first minute of play. The is no rpg in the world that don't limit in some way what you can make the character do if you want to play it well.<br/><br/>If I would teach some freeform enthusiast the value of rules, I think I would start by making him play "until we sink" (then I would follow with some jeepform, of course)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180249/#Comment_180249" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T09:45:03+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  9:45AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went back and reread the text. The second paragraph clearly says this:\n<blockquote>The game is divided into five to seven days. Each day's gaming consists of the characters sitting on the hotel patio in the evening, talking. What happens outside of these evenings is not played out, but the players can make up things which has happened and mention them in their character's conversation.</blockquote>\nThat is, the rules make it clear that you shouldn't do anything but have a conversation. I had not entirely processed the power of that paragraph until now.<br/><br/>So here I will eat my words and concede the argument. By limiting play to a conversation and explicitly stating that only the discussions between characters are to be played out, and that everything else happens off-screen, the game avoids the need for anything but rules about talking. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the game goes on to tell players:\n<blockquote>A general advice: Don't object too much. If another character states that he has seen you clean blood off your hands down by the tide mark, it's better to make up a plausible explantion rather than saying \xabIt\u2019s a lie!\xbb.</blockquote>\nThis is the equivalent of improv's "Yes, And..." principle and is similar to "roll the dice or say yes" in Dogs. It's instruction to the players to do two things: 1) accept as much as you can into the fiction, and 2) when you must object, work it out among the players.  It also suggests that one's objections are made in-character, not as a player; the rules would be improved by making this clearer.<br/><br/>In any case, I think I would have communicated better had I said, "This is clearly a role-playing game, but it is missing some essential parts that players are forced to make up themselves in order to play." I was headed that way in my last post, where I used the analogy of a vehicle. "This is clearly a car, but it is missing wheels! How am I to drive it? Do I carry it, or slide it on the ground, or is it actually meant to float in the water, or do I just need to find some wheels and attach them?" In the case of Until We Sink, the game actually is a car that doesn't need wheels because it's constrained so much by the "only dialog" requirement. To strain the analogy even further, the players just sit inside the car and talk, so they don't need to drive it at all. But it's still a car, and it's complete enough for its own sake.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I still see very little here that is ground-breaking in the RPG design field. Perhaps it is ground-breaking in Scandinavian circles but not globally (and this is a forum with global representation). The game hasn't really solved any problems, except by constraining them away. Instead of improving the technology of automobile wheels, it's simply removed the wheels and said that the car doesn't have to drive. This feels to me like a regression to improv and make-believe without adding anything new in the design arena. You can't rediscover an older thing and call it innovative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180250/#Comment_180250" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T09:49:00+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  9:49AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>If rules for resolving certain kinds of conflicts isn't needed because they're not supposed to come up during play, then why does the text not just explicitly say, "Avoid any situation other than talking, unless you want to resolve things consensually"?</blockquote>\nI don't know how to say this more clearly. It's because <i>not everyone will come to role-playing looking for conflict</i>. It would be a little bit like putting a note on the Star Wars book saying "avoid any situation involving physical fights between the players, unless you want to resolve things by calling the police". \n<blockquote>Why should this (people not steeped...) be a requirement? If we play according to the text as written, shouldn't we get the same kind of experience you have when you play?</blockquote>\nBecause of gamer baggage; specifically american indie gamer baggage. You're expecting a certain kind of experience, and coming to this game with those expectations will not work. Just like trying to play "Burning Empires" expecting a freeform larp won't work. \n<blockquote>And how can I play it as written when the text leaves answers to some important questions unwritten?</blockquote>\nI spent some time trying to answer your questions about the radio, above.

Yeah, that would have cleared things up for me, just as rereading the text cleared some things up for me.<br/><br/>I still don't buy the "people not steeped" thing. It's a "brain damage" argument and I don't accept the frame. If you're saying that certain kinds of gamers are so embedded in their habits that they cannot play a game right after reading the rules, I disagree. If you're saying that those gamers cannot play a game right because they are required to bring some <i>different baggage</i> to the table, and their baggage isn't the right kind, that's another matter. That's basically saying, "Until We Sink is a game that can't be played by Americans" or whatever. I don't buy that, either.<br/><br/>If a game requires a certain mode of thought, just make that clear in the text. And we're in agreement on the point that follows: Until We Sink <i>does</i> make it clear how to play (limit play to a discussion among characters). The rules DO explicitly say, "Avoid any situation other than talking, unless you want to resolve things consensually." Cool. I had just not fully grokked that on first reading.<br/><br/>I conceded this point in my last post, and you can bash me over the head with it if you want, but you can't make me concede that point any further than I already have!  <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180265/#Comment_180265" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T11:10:29+00:00" title="November 25, 2008 11:10AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, the rules don't say that. They say that "what happened" is not decided by rolling dice, but by talking about it afterwards on the patio of the hotel. You can attack the other characters, you can even try to kill them (you can't kill them until the last scene, of course), all you have to do is talk about what happened. As I said in my post, in one game the other players "explained" the mysteries by telling that they had "discovered" that my character (the hotel owner) was a vampire, and that I had taken them to the boat to flee the island to have a supply of victim for the travel. I simply smiled, said "yes", and that was the end of the game...<br/><br/>It's a resolution system. It's not based on conflicts, on dice (well, apart from some specific case...), or tokens: it's based on player's input, credibility and narrative truth. It's not so much different from Wushu in that sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

It's a "brain damage" argument and I don't accept the frame. If you're saying that certain kinds of gamers are so embedded in their habits that they cannot play a game right after reading the rules, I disagree. If you're saying that those gamers cannot play a game right because they are required to bring somedifferent baggageto the table, and their baggage isn't the right kind, that's another matter. That's basically saying, "Until We Sink is a game that can't be played by Americans" or whatever. I don't buy that, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to be clear (since the 'people not steeped' quote is mine), I did *not* mean to imply that the requirement to play this kind of game is somehow missing from people brain-damaged by other games - in my opinion the whole infamous 'games-can-give-you-brain-damage' statement is basically just a huge hyperbolic load of attention-getting crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I meant (and suspect Tomas means) is that approaching this style of game like it's akin to conflict-resolving games like 'Dogs in the Vineyard', 'The Shadow of Yesterday', etc. is like approaching 'My Life With Master' expecting it to be handle all the things you could do using GURPS - it's emphatically *not* that 'Until we Sink' is missing rules, or requires a player workaround, or requires previous familiarity with that kind of freeform game, it's that the play experience is expected to be about completely different interactions than the type you get with 'Dogs in the Vineyard', where conflict is always close at hand and the ability to escalate to violence is a central part of the central theme. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers will either need to come to a game like 'Until We Sink' with a different set of expectations, or have no expectations before going in, for it to be a success. My comment about being 'not steeped' means if your group comes with the expectation that the game will need to be able to resolve what happens if the Caretaker decides to shoot all the other guests, then I suspect your group will come away thinking the game as deeply flawed and broken - which I think is emphatically not the case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180313/#Comment_180313" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T14:20:49+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  2:20PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Adam, the rules don't say that.</blockquote>\nSay what? I don't know what you're referring to. Can you quote the bit you mean?<br/>\n<blockquote>They say that "what happened" is not decided by rolling dice, but by talking about it afterwards on the patio of the hotel. You can attack the other characters, you can even try to kill them (you can't kill them until the last scene, of course), all you have to do is talk about what happened. As I said in my post, in one game the other players "explained" the mysteries by telling that they had "discovered" that my character (the hotel owner) was a vampire, and that I had taken them to the boat to flee the island to have a supply of victim for the travel. I simply smiled, said "yes", and that was the end of the game...<br/><br/>It's a resolution system. It's not based on conflicts, on dice (well, apart from some specific case...), or tokens: it's based on player's input, credibility and narrative truth. It's not so much different from Wushu in that sense.</blockquote>\nI feel like we're talking past each other. In any case, I think we're on the same page about how Until We Sink is actually played (read my later posts in this thread -- I've had a total change of heart).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_180334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180334/#Comment_180334" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T15:10:06+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  3:10PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2008 3:10PM by TomasHVM.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adrian P</cite>the play experience is expected to be about completely different interactions than the type you get with 'Dogs in the Vineyard', where conflict is always close at hand and the ability to escalate to violence is a central part of the central theme.</blockquote>Quite right, Adrian!

Every player can add, by dialog,  any narration  he/she want without asking anybody before.<br/><br/>How can this work without devolving in utter chaos? In the same way Polaris, Dust Devils, the Pool or any other game where you give narrational authority to the players work.  People usually are much better players that "traditional role-playing wisdom" give them credit for. <br/><br/>About "explaining why this game is fun"...  I don't know, I usually don't go around forcing people to play games with me. The premise is usually that we want to play a game, THEN we choose the game.  And I really don't think that explaining "the point of this game is to create a cool story" is much different if you have in your hands a copy of Sorcerer or a copy of Until We sink.
