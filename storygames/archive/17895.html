Game theory is bad when it comes to explaining the game. Does anyone have an idea of how to write so that I can present game mechanics without having to tell the reader why they exist? Sure, I can use headlines and a terminology that explains what it does, but what if I had headlines that said P\xe4sadkjlf or Fjodifa? How should I give structure to the text so people can grok it?<br/><br/>Yes, the question is vague but that's only because I hardly know what I want myself. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I want a game text that purely talks about structures and that the reader instinctively understands the use of while reading it.

But I'm game (so to speak). Maybe I'll say something that helps some-one else (if only myself ).<br/><br/>  Hemingway Clarit-ay: use the simplest words to express what you mean - when you exhort your circumlocutious epistemology on structures in a cromulent idiom.<br/><br/>  Dr. Seuss Pompatus: Repeat important KEY CONCEPTS and technical/game specific JARGON until the unusual JARGON which is KEY to your CONCEPTS becomes familiar. Then you can leave out the adjectives and simply refer to the KEYS and CONCEPTS. Repetition is very effective in children's literature and technical manuals. <br/>C: DOS  -   C: DOS\\RUN  -    RUN\\DOS\\RUN ! (stoopid DOS)<br/><br/>  "Use the Tone, L\u014dc": Here are a few types of tone that games use:<br/>  The Buddy: Speaking directly to the reader in a familiar manner. One YouTube  (and Several RPG.net) reviewer(s) find this overly-familiar but the Octane Rpg uses it effectively.<br/>  The Narrator: always-Always-ALWAYS in a Morgan Freeman voice. This also speaks to the reader directly but in an authoritative voice. There is no cajoling here, you WILL listen and you WILL follow the rules.<br/>  Stereo Instructions: insert Tab A into Slot B. Best used in small blocks and followed by -<br/><br/>   examples, Examples, EXAMPLES (followed by more examples that exemplify exemputaneously!)<br/><br/>  And here I finally get to the heart of your question : "how to write so that I can present game mechanics without having to tell the reader why they exist" - remember, this isn't just for you; I'm finding it immensely useful...<br/><br/>  Show, don't tell.<br/><br/>  Fjodifa: the Kumbaya Maru (also known as the "Everybody Wins" scenario)<br/>  When two or more more players wish to Fjodifa together by co-operating in an action, each rolls their die normally but only the highest result counts towards Success. Participating players have used up their individual Turn but all participants share in the Success or Failure of the highest roll.<br/>  Ex: Cpt. Spock and Lt. Savik agree to jointly Fjodifa, by both aiming at the same Bird of Prey. Spock rolls a 5, Savik a 3. Fortunately, the Target Number is 4. The Bird of Prey is destroyed and both Vulcans share in the Glory. However, there are two more war ships and it is their Turn to act (since the players have Fjodifa and jointly used up their Turns). Savik questions the logic of spending two shots on one enemy; Spock points out that, all things being equal, two enemy war ships are one fewer than three enemy war ships.<br/><br/>  Anyway...<br/><br/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404912/#Comment_404912" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-29T00:33:26+00:00" title="January 29, 2013 12:33AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a thing that the Fiasco book does, which is to identify what kind of reader is currently reading, and guide them accordingly.<br/><br/>Whatever your game is, chances are that it relies on certain unspoken assumptions that some people will already have (so it's a waste explaining them again), some people don't have (so you have to instill them from ground zero), and some people misinterpret (so you have to show them how to loosen their preconceptions).<br/><br/><br/>I also have a suspicion that there's really no such thing as a ground-zero grok. You 'grok' when you're already well familiar with a game, but then encounter something that will explain the core of your experiences succintly.

The form it takes is a text that is handed around the table. A person reads off an introductory section, which then follows up with some activity for the group to do that helps set up the game fiction.<br/><br/>When that is done, the text is handed to the next person, who reads a section out loud and the grop follows further instructions for another activity related to setting u the game.<br/><br/>And it passes around like that until the fiction is set up, and play begins.<br/><br/>I'm really not doing justice to how clever I think this approach is to conveying how to play a game to a group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404948/#Comment_404948" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-29T11:14:26+00:00" title="January 29, 2013 11:14AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2013 11:16AM by creases.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Always read what you've written aloud.<br/>Always show drafts to multiple willing proofreaders.<br/>Always revise, again and again revise and revise.<br/>Try it multiple ways, and keep what proves to convey what you want.<br/>If you have the budget for it, hire a professional editor.<br/><br/>There's really no answer but: to do it, you have to do it.

I realize roleplaying culture is different, but judging rules based on one reading of them and then being willing to change them is a thing I really don't like about roleplaying culture and don't want to foster in the rules I write. So I think this is an opinion thing (no surprise there).<br/><br/>However, it can be helpful--if it's a very weird or non-intuitive rule--to describe a little bit of the intention behind the rule. But isn't an example of play the best way to show this without just dissecting the rules of the game in the game?<br/><br/>And as Komradebob says, rules that are read out loud at the table can help a lot. In addition to Fuck Youth, Silver and White does this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404955/#Comment_404955" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-29T12:55:38+00:00" title="January 29, 2013 12:55PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard,<br/>  Playtesting is how I solved this.<br/>  I use the description that I give in playtesting that actually clicks with players to go back and edit my rules.<br/>  ysing this technique has vastly improved the quality of my rules as written.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404965/#Comment_404965" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-29T15:06:45+00:00" title="January 29, 2013  3:06PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do blind playtesting -- groups that do not have you or any of the people you played the game with.<br/>Also, a lot of times, you're not going to know how we use the text.

I wasn't clear - I'm trying to say that, if rules are asking you to make something up for the story, it might help to know *why* that part of the story is important. This is an over-simplistic example, but it if you were to ask players to create relatioships perhaps it would help to explain that character relationships can make a more tightly-knit and emotive story. Anyway, I digress.<br/><br/>Reading aloud is a bloody great idea.

I also had the idea that grok is something that you can't instantly get. That parts need to interact ... or be referred to, as you say. I wonder if it's as simple as having "This game is about..." as an ingress and then follow up with rules that explains how the game creates that?\n<blockquote>::: Narrative model (The Hollywood model - the monomyth)<br/>1.

So if you want the game mechanics to create a certain mood, establish the mood through the text to begin with, and the reader will be more open to why the rules exist?<br/><br/>I find it interesting that AIDA and ANSA have action last. Of course, if you want to sell something, you want the consumer to actually go and buy your merchandise, but is this something that you can let your reader do in a roleplaying text as well?
