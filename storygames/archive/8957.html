And I started remembering all the fun times I had back in those days, with my crazy homemade system and our even crazier homebrew setting, and all the mercenary looting, backstabbing, plotting, and ultraviolence that went on.  And now I want to redesign that game, with, y'know, a system that works and doesn't require a calculator (it worked back then, but required a calculator).<br/><br/>And then this happened:<br/><br/><b>PHILOSOPHY OF DUNGEONS</b><br/><br/>MOOD<br/>The mood of a dungeon needs to be weird, creepy, oppressive, and hostile. The players should feel like the dungeon has a mind of its own, and it\u2019s out to get their characters.<br/><br/>ORIGIN<br/>Dungeons don\u2019t have to come from anywhere. They\u2019re just there, being what they are. If there is any explanation at all for why a dungeon exists, it should be vague and creepy.<br/><br/>MONSTERS<br/>Monsters should be rare, frightening, and truly dangerous. When a monster shows up, the players and their characters should be having an Oh Shit moment.<br/><br/>Monsters don\u2019t come in species. There is no such thing as \u201ca hydra.\u201d There might be such a thing as a unique, horrible being with numerous regenerating heads, named Hydra.<br/><br/>RIVALS<br/>The PCs aren\u2019t the only treasure hunters out there. Sometimes you will run into others. Is there ever enough treasure for both expeditions?* Better wreck \u2018em.<br/><br/>*If you answered \u201cyes,\u201d shut up and go home. Pansy.<br/><br/>DANGER<br/>Since monsters are rare, and rivals are not a given, danger comes primarily from the dungeon itself. Think beyond traps. Traps are there because somebody set them: either rivals, or long-ago denizens. Otherwise, think of how the environment can be dangerous. Collapsing ceilings; crevices; horrible thorns; fire; gas leaks; radiation; whatever.<br/><br/>DENIZENS<br/>Every now and then, there might be sentient-types living in a dungeon. This should be ultra-rare and also kinda freaky. The players should, upon realizing the fact, be left saying, \u201cMy God, they were living down here?\u201d That\u2019s a.) how horrible dungeons should be, such that the thought of living in them is crazy-talk, and b.) how degenerate and depraved anyone living in a dungeon should be.<br/><br/>STRUCTURE<br/>A dungeon should not be a linear sequence of encounters and challenges. It should be a solid environment for the PCs to move around in and interact with freely. Given a choice between two doors, the GM better have something different ready (or easily rolled from charts) behind each door.<br/><br/>RISK<br/>The business of a dungeoneer is sussing out risk, comparing it to prospective reward (and data on this subject may be lacking), and making decisions accordingly. Risk and reward should both be present. The GM shouldn\u2019t worry about whether they\u2019re balanced. It\u2019s the players\u2019 jobs to decide whether taking the expedition deeper or quittin while they\u2019re ahead is the best course of action. And they might very well be wrong. Tough, better luck next time.<br/><br/>PROVISIONS<br/>It matters what the PCs bring with them. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> cause of dungeoneer death: starvation.<br/><br/>PCs have only what they can carry. If you don\u2019t have a place to put it, you can\u2019t carry it. Sometimes you have to choose between things like food, tools, and armaments, and the Gold.<br/><br/>CHALLENGES<br/>The players should periodically be faced with puzzles and challenges. How do we get this safe open? How do we get across this chasm? How can I reach that thing hanging from the ceiling?<br/><br/>These should be open-ended whenever possible, or at least have multiple solutions. The GM may prep an easy way, concealed behind hints that the players might catch onto or not (and if they don\u2019t figure out, then they don\u2019t). But no key hunts. If a door\u2019s locked, and you don\u2019t have the key, you knock it down.<br/><br/>RIDDLES<br/>I lied. Rarely, a puzzle should be posed that has only one right answer. It should be mystifying and weird, and it should yield great rewards. How do I open this box that mysteriously won\u2019t break? Expose it to the light of the full moon. Keep such riddles rare, and never make them required; they\u2019re like a bonus thing. There should be clues to these, but they should be hidden and/or enigmatic so that only thorough and/or clever players will catch on. <br/><br/>...and then this happened:<br/><b>CLASS LIST</b><br/>MUSCLE &amp; KILLERS<br/>Bruiser<br/>Carver<br/>Daredevil<br/>Junk Knight<br/>Maddog<br/>Shootist<br/>Tank<br/><br/>MAGICIANS &amp; MYSTICS<br/>Changer<br/>Cooler<br/>Helter-Skelter<br/>Gloomdoll<br/>Reader<br/>Root Doctor<br/>Scarecrow<br/>Stringman<br/>Tattooist<br/>Tripper<br/><br/>TECHNICIANS &amp; SPECIALISTS<br/>Archaeologist<br/>Croaker<br/>Hustler<br/>Gearhead<br/>Sawbones<br/>Trapster<br/>Wheelman<br/>Yegg<br/><br/>VERSATILE / OTHER<br/>Drifter<br/>Hardcase<br/>Gambler<br/>Snake Eater<br/><br/><br/>...and I don't know what I'm gonna do with any of it yet.

The mechanics will definitely be tricky,  I would love to see a relatively minimalist system, maybe along the lines of <b>Red Box Hack</b> or <b>Storming the Wizard's Tower</b> (they come to mind because I've been looking at them lately).  Dungeon creation should probably be the focus of the game, with a detailed (but still simple/elegant) system for defining rooms, corridors, monsters, loot, etc.  It would also be cool to have support for GM-less and/or random dungeon creation, though it would be hard to work puzzles and riddles into the mix.  That's getting in to board game territory, however (not that that's necessarily a bad thing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197834/#Comment_197834" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T12:05:11+00:00" title="March 19, 2009 12:05PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well shit, I've had dungeon fever too, probably sparked by all the D&amp;D nostalgia RPG forums are dripping with nowadays (I never played D&amp;D or anything similar so my nostalgia is an illusion, or possibly origins from the board game Dungeonquest). So me and a friend got determined to draw half a dungoen each and fill it with the most annoying, random shit imaginable. Many random unfair deahts. I think what I really want from this is something I've never managed by emulate in roleplaying games and rarely happens in computer games and sometimes gets done right in movies: characters succeeding because they are so damn good at what they do. I dont mean people killing a bunch of people because they are the best swordsmen ever but actually leaving their skills transparent making their actions kind of no brainers but they keep doing them right over and over. I love when people play sniper types in my games because I secretly wish they portray themselves as immensly skilled through narration about shit like looking at the vegetation and turning their sun bleached clothes inside out to better match the color.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically, I want the players to go through a bunch of characters and slowly learn to recognize patterns and small quirks in the dungeon to gradually survive better. Like: potions have consistent effects based on color but the players don't know which colors are poison and which are healing before trying them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom your earlier Bonedogs posts I suspect you want the same thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197848/#Comment_197848" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T12:41:51+00:00" title="March 19, 2009 12:41PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "company" idea is exactly the concept of John Nephew's board game Tomb.

He's also good at taking a punch.<br/>Carver - this guy is good at cutting people up with edged weapons. He's fast and has a high damage output, but not so hot on defense.<br/>Daredevil - this guy has suicidal tendencies. He does crazy stunt attacks, and gets bonus damage when he hurts himself.<br/>Junk Knight - kinda like a DnD fighter, plus gadgets.<br/>Maddog - this guy is best with improvised and unconventional weapons (like chainsaws). Plus, he's on drugs. Depending on whether he's more sneaky or more beefy, he's either like the main guy from the video game <i>Manhunt 2</i>, or he's like the Tremor Bros. in <i>Smokin' Aces</i>.<br/>Shootist - gun specialist. Quickdraws and trickshots. Not a gunslinger. It's like the difference between a lion and a tiger. A dead tiger.<br/>Tank - big dude, with a big weapon, covered in plate steel. Put him in front and point him at the enemy.<br/><br/>MAGICIANS &amp; MYSTICS<br/>Changer - this guy changes into animals. But, like, only partially. Like, he changes his jaw to a crocodile's jaw, and his hands to bear claws, and his skin to rhino hide.<br/>Cooler - this guy shuts down magic. It's what the technical types call <i>abjuration</i>. Practical types call it <i>cooling</i>.<br/>Helter-Skelter - this guy does the kind of magic that blows shit up.<br/>Gloomdoll - this guy does magic with death and darkness and whatnot. Angst optional, androgyny required.<br/>Reader - this guy gets into people's heads. He can punch them in the mind while he's there, or he can share wounds to help hurt buddies. Sometimes he gets stuck, so be careful.<br/>Root Doctor - this guy makes potions and stuff out of herbs and parts of chickens and such.<br/>Scarecrow - ....uh, I don't actually remember what I had in mind for this.<br/>Stringman - this guy does magic by playing musical instruments. Like Erich Zann, but a badass.<br/>Tattooist - his tattoos are magical. But they have to be showing to work, so no armor for you.<br/>Tripper - this guy does magic by doing drugs.<br/><br/>TECHNICIANS &amp; SPECIALISTS<br/>Archaeologist - specialist on oldTech, and appraising artifacts<br/>Croaker - a doctor, with emphasis on pharmaceuticals. Good partners with a Maddog or Tripper.<br/>Hustler - good at the business end of things. Sells treasure for better profit, gets better contracts.<br/>Gearhead - builds and repairs shit. Good partners with a Junk Knight or Wheelman.<br/>Sawbones - a doctor, with emphasis on surgery. Good at setting bones, pulling bullets, and other essentials.<br/>Trapster - good at setting and disarming traps.<br/>Wheelman - good at driving. Because sometimes you have to make a getaway, and/or ram somebody off the highway.<br/>Yegg - this guy is good at picking locks, cracking safes, climbing to second stories, and all that.<br/><br/>VERSATILE / OTHER<br/>Drifter - ...uh, I don't really remember what this was either.<br/>Hardcase - this guy is like Harry Callahan, Bob Lee Swagger, and Roland of Gilead (except, not as good with guns; that's Shootist territory). He's just an all-around badass, who can stare down anyone.<br/>Gambler - this guy takes his chances. There's gonna be some kind of Risk mechanic, and he'll get to do cool stuff with it.<br/>Snake Eater - like a ranger, except with whiskey, cigarettes, and gunpowder on his breath.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197884/#Comment_197884" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T15:53:58+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  3:53PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2009 3:54PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff.

That's good!<br/><br/>As for support guys going into dungeons... I kinda like the idea of them going in. I mean, a Gearhead is good to have around the very moment that your home-made power armor shuts down; you don't want to have to wait 'til you get home.<br/><br/>The Hustler's really the only one who wouldn't be much use in a dungeon; he's only good at one thing (but it's something that no one else is good at), and it ain't survival.

What're you, a Lvl 10 Reader?</blockquote>\nNope!  Just a guy with some random ideas and whom has trouble ever putting them down on paper.  However, I'm definitely eager to share.  I love what you've got down here so far in terms of system and flavour, and can't wait to see how it fleshes out.<br/><br/>Have you thought at all about the dungeon creation yet?  I once had a discussion which made me start thinking about the possibilities of a room/encounter creation system in which every element in the room could be assigned a value and added up to fit some sort of budget.  Consider D&amp;D 4E, with traps and monsters sharing the same encounter budget, but instead include all possible interactive objects into that budget.<br/><br/>e.g. This room has lit torches (1 pt), a threadbare rug (1 pt), a pressurized gas tank (5 pts), an old wooden table (3 pts), and a giant squid monster (20 pts).  <br/><br/>Alternatively, the non-threatening objects (torches, rugs) could be on a budget separate from the threats (monsters, traps, hazards).  So the example above would be an encounter valued at 10/20, instead of just 30.  This is probably the better way to do it, actually.<br/><br/>This would create rooms that are both encounters and fully dynamic environments, in which the players know exactly what nearby objects they can improvise with, as they're listed out for them.  Objects could also have stats of some sort, or listed ways of interacting with them.  Or perhaps could just be associated with a D&amp;D 4E "page 42"-style chart based on point value.  That is, a 1pt item can be used to do about 1d6 damage, and has one "skill" at value "5" (or whatever).  This way you could differentiate between a 1pt small torch and 5pt giant brazier, without having to stat every item out individually.   You would just know that the item is a source of fire, easy to carry, and not particularly threatening, or it's a source of fire, hard to move, and fairly threatening.  <br/><br/>A system like this also lends itself well to random generation.  A couple rolls could be used to generate any sort of random object, and do it a few times and you've got a room full of toys to play with.<br/><br/>Anyways, it's late, and I'm rambling on here, and this may not even make any sense.

Like, the GM has a map (that he doesn't show to the players), and he maybe has a few notes jotted down -- mostly for things that pertain to challenges &amp; riddles he has planned. Other than that, he just rolls on tables.  <i>Somewhere</i>, I've got tables that I used in an older version of the Rustbelt for randomly generating objects -- one for things found in drawers and filing cabinets, one for things found in bookshelves, one for things found in closets, and so on.

That is, say, for example, breaking things involved rolling under your Strength + your Intelligence (not just hitting it hard, but knowing where to hit it).  That way, with only 6 stats, you would actually have 21 pseudo stats, giving you a lot more room to differentiate the classes.<br/><br/>Using the traditional 6 D&amp;D stats, you could probably assign a pair to each of your listed actions here.  Or you can add some flavour to them, something like the list from Rustbelt.  I'd probably go with the stats being action verbs, just for the feel of it.  Something like Hurt, Sneak, Tinker, Charm, React, Think, and (some action verb for being lucky, which I can't think of at moment.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198091/#Comment_198091" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T15:54:02+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  3:54PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2009 3:54PM by Rafu.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite><br/>...hit somebody hard.<br/>...hit somebody precisely.<br/>...shoot somebody.<br/>...attack someone from behind.<br/>...sneak.<br/>...move something heavy.<br/>...break things.<br/>...fix things.<br/>...make things.<br/>...set traps.<br/>...analyze things to figure out their functions.<br/>...dismantle things safely/for parts.<br/>...stare people down.<br/>...keep your cool.<br/>...avoid getting hit.<br/>...make split-second reactions.<br/>...do magic.<br/>...notice things.<br/>...steal from people.<br/>...climb &amp; scramble over things.<br/>...jump over gaps.<br/>...run fast.<br/>...trick people.<br/>...see through tricks.<br/>...move while constrained/encumbered by stuff you're wearing/carrying.<br/>...pick locks.<br/>...luck out.<br/><br/>These must be consolidated into as few attributes as possible.</blockquote>\nWhy?<br/><br/>I mean, you totally have a punctually compiled list of all the needed skills, there.

Which suggests that I define every possible move, which I don't want to do.<br/><br/>The thing is, I want this to be not so much "who can manipulate the listed moves best" so much as "who can cope with the dungeon, constrained by their character's abilities, the best."<br/><br/>I'm not throwing out the other idea entirely, but the unified stats are sounding good right this moment. Probably:<br/><br/>Hit<br/>See<br/>Think<br/>Move<br/>Endure<br/><br/>and also the sanity mechanic, whatever I decide to call it. Then each character will have exceptions, bonuses, and special rules written on its sheet.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the Maddog looks almost exactly the same this way. He's got his stats, then in all his rules, it says stuff like "Roll under Hit to murder someone helpless or unsuspecting" and "Roll under See to find a good hiding place," except there's listed bonuses for some of it.<br/><br/>This way, I can also list penalties. Thus, the Hustler gets bonuses to Think when tricking/seeing through tricks and appraising everyday valuables, but penalties when analyzing devices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198347/#Comment_198347" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T10:19:01+00:00" title="March 23, 2009 10:19AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2009 10:36AM by John_Harper.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear ya, Marshall. Listing every possible move would be crazy. There are other ways of handling that problem, of course.<br/><br/>Broad attributes are one way. They tend to be dull. Hit, See, Think, Move, Endure is a pretty boring list. I look at that, and I don't get inspired to say cool things. To be fair, a lot of great games have boring attributes. Heart, Acuity, Body, Will. Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha. Fighting Ability, Non-Fighting Ability. Yawn.<br/><br/>If you keep specific color like "find a good hiding place" and "saw off your own damaged limb" in there somewhere, then it's probably okay though. It's the gritty, cool, colorful stuff that grabs the imagination and makes us want to go raid a dungeon.

It seems to me that you've got a good setup there, Marshall.  Keep the base list, and then just add "strengths" and "weaknesses" for specific edge cases for that character.  So, a big bruiser-type might have Hit 5, and then +3 while slamming and grappling, so he's not quite good at shooting or being subtle.  You can easily write the character flavour into his edge cases, as John mentioned.  Definitely seems much more elegant than my random ideas above. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198361/#Comment_198361" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T11:15:30+00:00" title="March 23, 2009 11:15AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not have completely different mechanics for different classes?

I want to be fairly concrete about that, so that players are MacGuyvering their traps out of available materials. The Trapster's the best at it, is all. And probably doesn't have to roll to not trigger his own traps, unlike the rest of you poor saps.<br/><br/>It strikes me that the problem I'm having with the character design isn't really the stats' fault; in fact, I think that both ways (individualized or unified) could work equally well. The real issue here is the moves. Of the moves that are listed on a character, which ones are only available to that class? (F'rinstance, the "murder" move is Maddog only) Of the moves that <i>aren't</i> listed, which ones are those that the GM just decides what stat to roll, which ones are those that you're bad at, and which ones are those that you can't do at all?<br/>What I need is an elegant way to handle that issue, I think.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Hey Marshall, does the entirety of play take place inside dungeons? If not, what else gets played?</blockquote>\nMaybe? If not all, then most. Or at least mostly in dungeons, and on the way there and back (which is where the Wheelman comes into his own -- sometimes you get there, and somebody else has already found the treasure, so you steal it, and run, and need a quick getaway).<br/><br/>Any non-dungeon content would be private contracts: some guy hires you to clear out some greenies (goblins) in this old city block he just bought, so that he can renovate it; some guy hires you to rescue someone; some guy hires you to kill this dragon that's taken over the bank, using the vault as his hoard; y'know, your basic adventurer sort of stuff. Except, your characters are all totally imbalanced mentally, 'cause in this setting, nobody else would do the dungeon thing. So, they do the job, and they get back a Customer Satisfaction Survey* a day later that says "YOU FUCKHEADS BLEW UP MY BANK, KILLED SIXTEEN PEOPLE, TWO OF WHICH I HIRED TO GO WITH YOU, AND ONE OF WHICH YOU ATE! NO, I'M NOT SATISFIED!" But, hey, you've got his money already.<br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more I realize that this game is about having a shit job, but being the only person who's good at it, and being proud of that and pissed about it at the same time.<br/><br/>*I'm totally going full-bore with the whole company idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>I got dungeon fever - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8957/i-got-dungeon-fever/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="I got dungeon fever - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8957/i-got-dungeon-fever/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content='Okay, then.

Maybe the more horrifically you behave, the shadier the applicants for your services, and the more heinous the missions they offer you...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198438/#Comment_198438" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T15:17:32+00:00" title="March 23, 2009  3:17PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random thought: your employers could try to tax you on any cool stuff you found in the dungeon.

The real issue here is the moves. Of the moves that are listed on a character, which ones are only available to that class? (F'rinstance, the "murder" move is Maddog only) Of the moves that<i>aren't</i>listed, which ones are those that the GM just decides what stat to roll, which ones are those that you're bad at, and which ones are those that you can't do at all?<br/>What I need is an elegant way to handle that issue, I think.</blockquote>\nSo how's about something like this?  You have values in each of the five stats, as well as a bonus to two situational actions, a penalty to one action, and then a special "move" which lets you break the rules in some way.  Simple, and you can fit a lot of flavour into those bonuses, penalties, and special ability.  For example (assuming roll-under using d10s):<br/><br/>Carver:<br/>Hit 6<br/>See 5<br/>Think 3<br/>Move 7<br/>Endure 4 <br/><br/>Bonuses:<br/>+2 when trying to hit with an edged melee weapon  (he's good at slicing people up)<br/>+2 when moving to avoid ranged attacks  (he's a bit of a blur as he charges towards you)<br/>Penalty<br/>-2 when trying to hit with a non-edged weapon<br/><br/>Special: Blade Dance<br/>When wielding an edged weapon, the Carver re-rolls all damage dice that show the highest possible value, and adds the new results to the original total.<br/><br/><br/>Of course, you could easily make it such that each character has two or three special abilities, if you'd like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198451/#Comment_198451" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T17:52:04+00:00" title="March 23, 2009  5:52PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if there's like an actual customer satisfaction survey, that the GM really fills out after each adventure?    <br/><br/>Then stakes or the price of failing a roll* could be getting points taken off the customer review along with fictional penalties.

I need this as proof!"<br/></blockquote>\nThis is totally going in. I'm also thinking about making the character sheets look like job applications.<br/><br/>As far as heinous/non-heinous activity, and how that reflects on the company... <i>All</i> of the character classes are incentivized towards pretty heinous stuff. They're all a little wrong, and when Sanity starts dropping, they get worse (and most of them also get stronger). So, things like blowing shit up, cannibalism, stealing from the company, all of this is encouraged, as far as "getting the job done and surviving" is concerned.<br/><br/>The company levels up based on its net worth. This goes up as you bring in more revenue on jobs. This is connected to dungeoncrawls in that the more loot you keep for yourself, the less money the company makes. This is connected to independent contracts based on much you earn from completing the contract. How might this be connected to customer satisfaction? Well, that really just depends on the customers, don't it? You'll sure as hell never get another contract from one guy if you behaved like a pack of rabid gorillas on the last contract he gave you. Or, maybe you will, but you're his last resort, because no one else was crazy enough to do it.<br/><br/><br/>Also, here's a question:<br/>So, a Changer has to spend a lot of time living like animals. A Gloomdoll has to be all androgynous and spooky. A Reader has to open himself up to all sorts of psychic energies, some of which are hostile. Root Doctors have to find and taste all kinds of herbs and animal bits. A Scarecrow has to starve himself. A Stringman has to have a quirk with his hearing to hear the notes between notes. A Tattooist has to get tattoos and show them. A Tripper has to do drugs.<br/><br/>What do Coolers and Helter-Skelters have to do in order to get their power?<br/><br/>This isn't a balance issue; it's a color issue. All the other magic classes have to do something weird to get their magic.<br/><br/>Bear in mind that the only folks who go dungeoneering are the people whose... uh... qualifications are only good for dungeoneering. So, whatever it is that Coolers &amp; Helter-Skelters do, it should be something that would make it hard to get a decent paying job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198535/#Comment_198535" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T10:29:19+00:00" title="March 24, 2009 10:29AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2009 10:29AM by MikeRiverso.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coolers have to drain their own life energy in order to make room to soak up the magic energy around them.

A minute! Holy crap! This means that an "attack roll" doesn't represent one swing, it represents a whole minute's worth of feinting, dodging, slashing, and positioning! After years of moment-to-moment detail in my combat mechanics, I kinda like that. I think I'm going to do something like it.<br/><br/>I'm working on a damage system at the moment. At first, I was going to use the damage track from my older game that this was based on, which is uncannily similar to the damage track in the Burning Wheel (actually, there's a lot of things between my old game and Burning Wheel that are uncannily similar). But I'm thinking that I want something simpler and faster. However, I still want nasty details about broken bones and severed hands and severe bleeding and stuff.<br/><br/>Here's one thing that came to mind:<br/>A successful attack causes a "wound." Which means you roll on the Wound Table and see what the specific nature of the wound was. These would range from momentary stunning to instant death, in a variety of flavors. Thus, every successful hit has a chance to kill. "Damage bonuses" translate into forced re-rolls on the Wound Table, increasing your chances of ending up with something nasty.<br/><br/>Now I just gotta write out a damn table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201006/#Comment_201006" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T16:02:17+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  4:02PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a note: even in the 6-second rounds of 3.x and 4E, a single attack roll still doesn't represent one swing.  Six seconds is plenty of time for a lot of sword-swinging.<br/><br/>And a thought: if you're going with a table that can cause completely random deaths, you may want to find a way such that players can continue playing immediately, rather than having to wait for the rest of the party to get back to town so they can fill up their ranks again.  Nothing would suck more than being randomly killed and having to sit out the rest of the session.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd avoid instant deaths entirely.  I should be afraid of the giant not-of-this world monster, whom I know could kill me, but I decide to murder a house cat, there shouldn't really be a chance that it could off me in one hit.  Maybe different tables for different classes of monsters?  Mook, Standard, Elite, Boss?  Mooks can hurt, but won't kill you in one hit, whereas Bosses are fairly likely to kill you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201021/#Comment_201021" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T17:33:05+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  5:33PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite><br/>Here's one thing that came to mind:<br/>A successful attack causes a "wound."

Certain armor or weapon bonuses adjust up or down the chart.  Sooper big guns get a +2, or pieces of gear allow rerolling when the vehicle is imobilized (but not any other result better or worse).  Some results are only possible with bonuses, and some penalties remove the chance of "good" results.

I'm just thinking that there's two ways to go about it that don't make the player feel ripped off:<br/><br/>1) You have a powerful attachment to your character, (and thus a reason to want to see your character stay alive), and also have the means to make a real effort to keep that character alive, and not have him killed because of one lousy roll.  This is how I tend to approach RPGs.<br/><br/>2) Alternatively, you have no real attachment to your characters, they can die fairly randomly, and you have a way to keep playing the game if they do kick the bucket.  This way would be more appropriate to a board game.<br/><br/>Of course, if "Run away!" is this game's way of giving you a chance to save your character, then I'm perfectly fine with that.  As long as there's some sense of player control there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201460/#Comment_201460" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T14:52:18+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  2:52PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hell yeah, there's gonna be lots of running away.

Maybe?  I keep trying to work on it but I get sidetracked.  I do have character sheets for the Maddog and Cooler already, though. Ugly character sheets, but fully functional.<br/><br/>I've also hit upon this Physique mechanic that I'm excited about. See, the "HIT" attribute is about your ability to deal damage; your actual strength level is a separate thing, and handled by the Physique mechanic, which comes in flavors, not numbers: Massive, Beefy, Wiry, Scrawny, and Fat. Each class comes in a specific assortment of these; f'rinstance, Maddogs are either Beefy or Wiry, while all Coolers and Bruisers are Massive, and Shootists might be Wiry, Scrawny, or Fat.<br/><br/>Each Physique type can carry a certain amount of stuff (measured in "Bulk points" that aren't so much physical weight as how hard something is to carry, and how hard it is to move around while carrying it) before suffering penalties to his MOVE rolls, and gets static bonuses/penalties to doing certain things like knocking down doors or blocking people's paths. Like, if you're Massive, you're +1D to knock down a door, move something heavy, or block someone's path, but someone who's Scrawny is -1D to all of those things. Someone who is Fat is +1D to block someone's path, but -1D to all those others.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>You're looking at (haul from the dungeon) - (provisions cost) - (equipment cost) - (employee salary) - (hospital bills) - (funeral expenses), probably.</blockquote>\nHaha!
