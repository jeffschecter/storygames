Earthbending is nifty, but it's not something that's phrased in a way that lends itself to Mythic actions. And you'll be wanting Mythic actions by the end. I would say "Mastery of earthen power." Remember--Mythenders are badass and not sorry for it. There is no Level 0.<br/><br/>For reference: in the game I played, one of the other Mythenders had the following weapon: "Fishing lines made of the tears of my children." (who were killed by a plague) You will be using those weapons as springboards for your stuff...so yeah, I think you're a bit too conservative here. <br/><br/>"I can move unheard and unseen" is actually pretty good; it scales well. I'd bump up the mask to something like "My mask, which shows me the turmoil in all other souls." That's freakin' delicious Mythender goodness there. Remember you can totally weaponize that turmoil. It's legit to say "I reach into Thor's chest and crush his most beloved memories." It totally works. <b>That's</b> Mythender.<br/><br/>The forms look good, but I'd bump things up a bit more titanic by the time you get to Godly. Remember, you <b>are</b> almost a Myth at that point. Make Fate's Power bigger. "I can loose the bonds of entropy and unmake the ways of Creation." This is the guideline for your higher-up actions, after all.<br/><br/>These are my thoughts, based on the in-play experience that I've had.<br/><br/>Also, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZz74yFLkvg" rel="nofollow">theme music for character brainstorming</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414727/#Comment_414727" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-24T23:38:24+00:00" title="May 24, 2013 11:38PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you!

(Also, have you tried the mechanics out, even solo? They become a <b>lot</b> clearer when you've actually played them out.)<br/><br/>The answers to the questions basically serve to give the character a backstory, and that only comes up so much as the player wants it to come up. Generally speaking, it's the "why" of their fight, although players have likely just bought into "we're agonna end some Myths!" on its own. I suspect the answers to the questions will be far less important on the initial run-through, moreso if you actually embark on a campaign. The first time through, it's mostly coming to grips with the rules and the epic action and so on.<br/><br/>However, it <i>does</i> help to give some context. For instance, I established through my questions that my Mythender (who was an Abomination) was sired by Odin, thus making her Thor's half-sister.<br/><br/>Oh, and <b>push the envelope</b> when you get to the higher actions. I polished Thor off with the following Titanic action: from my "bag of devices that I have constructed to end myths (a relic weapon)", I drew forth bracers of incredible strength, and (since we were falling through a hole blasted through the center of the world...don't ask) slammed both sides of the world-hole on Thor. Yeah. I smashed him between the foundations of Norden. Like a pancake.<br/><br/>We also had another player literally call the Moon down to Norden. Two of the Mythenders died, smashed into its surface.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414737/#Comment_414737" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-25T10:09:38+00:00" title="May 25, 2013 10:09AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(Also, have you tried the mechanics out, even solo?
