This is the first time I've ever asked for game design help (outside of blathering about Little Ideas) so please forgive any faux pas.<br/><br/>This morning, I was looking over a board game design I had worked on a month or so, and it occurred to me that the premise would make an interesting situation for a role-playing game.<br/><br/>The Basic Premise:<br/><br/>Each player is a Vault Leader - an important figure from an underground vault built to withstand a nuclear attack.  20 years have passed since the bombs first dropped, and now the Leaders have chosen to lead their people back to the Surface to rebuild society.<br/><br/>Each vault leader has a particular vision for the new society.<br/>- The Commander wants to a society with strong Defense.<br/>- The Scientist wants a society rich in Industry.<br/>- The Trader wants a society with a strong Network.<br/>- The Archiver wants to restore Culture to society.<br/><br/>Players explore the Surface -- a post-apocalyptic wasteland that was once North America -- searching ruined cities, landfills, military bases, and other sites for Salvage.  To rebuild society, Leaders must use the Salvage they collect to restore lost Technology and overcome the new dangers of the Surface.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to make certain that the new society has more technology of your favored type that any other type by the end of the game.  The new surface society becomes stable when 12 Technologies have been restored.<br/><br/>My <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dzctznj_15cfrjdf" rel="nofollow">design notes</a> go into further detail.<br/><br/>The design I have now focuses mainly on individual exploration and recovery of relic and resources from the ruined post-apocalyptic landscape, with a couple side elements (like bartering and working together against periodic threats) that involve player interaction.<br/><br/>My goal is to have a game that is either publishable or at least presentable to other people (say, as a free PDF download).  Unfortunately, a big-box, component-heavy board game does not lend itself well to this goal.<br/><br/>I think it would be interesting to take the premise of post-apoc leaders with conflicting agendas and build a story game/rpg around that, perhaps switching the focus more towards the competition between the leaders and less on the individual resource management that I currently have.<br/><br/>Any thoughts on what direction I should take, or which elements I might focus on?<br/><br/>Also, am I asking the right questions here, or should I be more specific about the feedback I'm after?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>- Mike                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97485/#Comment_97485" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T08:37:25+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  8:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's interesting.<br/><br/>So, do the players play these various leaders and compete with their agendas?<br/><br/>If so, what sort of game is it?

I definitely see a clear WINNER, where the goal is to shape the emerging post-apoc society to fit your core values.  However, part of the fun would be the collaborative creation of the new society, as well as an exploration of a "tragedy of the commons" element of risking your own resources to help the group vs. yourself.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if that really answers the question, "what is the game about?" though.  I guess my answer is, "exploration of the <b>role of a leader</b> of a society trying to rebuild itself from the ashes of civilization."  That might be a tad broad.  I'd appreciate any input on how to tighten it up.<br/><br/>Ryan - Executive Decision looks cool.  I think the player selection of secondary agendas might be an interesting element to include, creating  alliances/rivalries among players.  Thanks for pointing it out.<br/><br/>Rich - I haven't played Alpha Centauri, but I see the similarities based on what I've read.

Of course, if you are trying to get away from the resource management end of things then the analogy between it and your game would break down.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Alpha Centauri as in your game, the factions are already generated before the game begins and you start growing your own little empire before running into the others.  I've often thought a game based before the faction split would be just as interesting.  All these ideas in one Vault vying for dominance while the robot drones are building society based on the orders it receives underground.  Then at the end of you all ascend and see what you've made.  Still, that's not your game I think.  Just a notion that came to me as I was writing this out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97516/#Comment_97516" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T10:41:54+00:00" title="September 19, 2007 10:41AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, Alpha Centauri the RPG would be Agora.
