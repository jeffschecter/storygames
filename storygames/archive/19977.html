The virus generated copies of all the citizen's condensed memories, and then scrambled and mixed up the original ones, causing mass hysteria memory loss and identity problems on an apocalyptic scale (for the city). The team itself got copied but thanks to an emergency firewall avoided the scrambling.<br/><b>The Boss</b> was : the AI the team was originally targeting at the time of the Renraku catastrophe. Her name is Arisu and her avatar looks like a scary red child.<br/>The team is composed by : <br/>Andrea as <b>S4r4_LX</b>, an ex-corporate deck-jockey who I was once employed by Renraku.<br/>Claudia as <b>Vent</b>, an ice-cold street samurai with a love of intimidation and too many metal parts.<br/>Davide as <b>Polly</b>, a joygirl who knows every John and Jane from here to New Amsterdam.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18ggly02bdp11jpg/original.jpg"/><br/><br/>The <b>recruitment</b> established how S4r4 was living the miserable life of a wage-slave after her neural cyberlink got fried by the catastrophe when Arisu offered a revolutionary treatment with nanomachines that would fully restore her; Vent was working as bouncer for a nightclub after leaving the mercenary live because someone very close to him committed suicide as a result of being scrambled by the catastrophe, until Arisu's plan of giving new bodies to the clean copies of the victims basically offered a hope of "resurrection" and redemption; Polly, having all her network of contacts and influences turned into a pile of scrambled lunatics ignorant of their own identity, had become a high level escort so she was more than enthusiastic at the idea of re-establishing in one stroke her original power base.<br/><br/>The final outline for the scenes looked like this:<br/>We're here to steal the condensed memories of thousands and upload them into fresh bodies using the planetwide uplink of the Tessier-Ashpool orbital stronghold.<br/>Lead Polly - infiltrate the orbital complex without raising the alarm (<i>we played Plan and Action scene</i>)<br/>Lead Vent - protect S4r4 from physical threats while cyber-diving (<i>we only played the Plan scene for now</i>)<br/>Lead S4r4 - use the orbital station to steal the memories from their storage location &amp; upload them to the new bodies<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>Overall this was fun, but we had constant doubts on who was supposed to say what and it also took quite a bit of guidance from the GM to help the Players get a clear idea of what they were supposed to say, until we finally distilled the "<i>play a scene about X things</i>" into straight questions the Player was to answer:<br/>- you are no longer in the game and you can't or won't go back in, why?<br/>- you are no longer in the game, so how do you earn your living now?<br/>- the Boss contacts you and makes you an offer you can't refuse, how and what is the offer?<br/><br/>Another thing we struggled with was turning the recruiting "scenes" into a list of proper action scenes.<br/>For the main objective "steal and upload data" the Boss hired S4r4 as a hacker. S4r4 then expressed her main concern (I'm defenceless while cyber-diving) and  recruited Vent to protect her. Then finally Vent wondered about how to get into the orbital station and hired Polly to chet their way in.<br/><br/>As GM I simply noted it down the things I already mentioned: infiltrate, protect, steal&amp;upload.<br/>But already the "protect" part felt problematic, as such action should happen as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">part of</span> the main objective, not as an obstacle to overcome <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in order to get there</span>.<br/>So when we got to play that part we needed to re-discuss the scene from zero, figuring out what it could have meant specifically in our story so far, with everyone struggling to reason things out in order to give a context in which to articulate the Player's plan.<br/>Es.. "<i>so you are in the shuttle headed for the station, considering how A and B happened previously you might expect C and D to wait for you ahead, also thanks to the data you gathered you know there will be a 5 man security team, and communication from earth might alert them ahead of time, and you need the mainframe to be mostly free of staff to do your thing</i>".<br/><br/>From the examples in the book we got the idea that this was supposed to be much more straightforward and simple, as the original action scene annotation should pretty much offer a self explanatory "thing to do" that the team only needs to detail a bit (I do this, you do that, who can help with this other thing?).<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>So we got the setting, the boss, the team and a list of scenes.<br/>Doing the first <b>Plan Scene</b> it was again awkward figuring out if the Players had to ask the GM for info or they could simply state whatever facts they wanted, while I felt at fault every time I used the GM authority to keep some Player from "wandering around" too much. The "<i>We\u2019re gonna go in X</i>" model didn't really work for us; maybe <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we should have put more effort</span> into using it no matter what, maybe saving us some headaches later on.<br/><br/>Then we started the <b>Action Scene</b>.<br/>The dice mechanic was easily grasped and right from the start the Players were looking for opportunities to set Anecdotes. But they never used them as suggested in the rules, as insults or rude comments; instead they were all very positive encouragements "<i>I remember that time when you did X, so this time it should be a piece of cake for you!</i>".<br/>They also felt <b>awkward</b>... are the Anecdotes in-fiction PC to PC banter? if so, what if my PC in snot present right now? or are they out-fiction statements of background info? or are they Player to Player teasing?<br/><br/>Also we completely forgot about the <b>Proficiency</b> bonus :P<br/><br/>But the main problem was the actual <b>scene framing</b>.<br/>As I told you the Planning scene required the group to put a lot of effort into turning a vague "<i>infiltrate the orbital complex without raising the alarm</i>" into something concrete, this is what we reasoned:<br/>- the idea is we get access to the station thanks to Polly being a sort of bachelor party gift for a station employee<br/>- to do this we need to know who works at the station and discover if there are viable targets (someone about to marry or to retire or to receive any kind of thing justifying a surprise party)<br/>- to do that we need to steal employee data from the corp owning the satellite<br/>- but such data is only accessible from the internal LAN of the corp's offices<br/>- so we need physical access to such an office<br/>- to do that we send Polly disguised as a journalist with S4r4 as assistant and camera operator<br/>- and to help them act undisturbed we send Vent to stir up some trouble posing as a drunkard, for diversion                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441637/#Comment_441637" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-18T14:22:25+00:00" title="January 18, 2015  2:22PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2015 2:25PM by Hasimir.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now we start with the turns... again the Players were pretty much clumsy and shy in framing, and I as GM was not sure if I was able/meant to just speak up and frame the scene for them.<br/><br/>Eventually Polly sets the scene in the corp office lobby area, bulshitting the receptionist into allowing her and S4r4 into the building and even give them a guide for a tour and to make interviews.<br/><br/>As GM I set two <b>elements</b>: <i>Donovan, the suspicious receptionist</i> and <i>office surveillance cameras</i>.<br/><br/>We roleplay a bit the back and forth between Polly and Donovan up until it's obvious we need to roll to see what happens. In the end Polly charms Donovan into being their guide for the tour, and they get in.<br/>(2/5 progress)<br/><br/>It's a good time for Vent's diversion so... what? Does Vent frames a new "scene"? Is acting in a different location, interacting with a different cast of NPCs, a new framing? Again we iron out the doubts and just describe how Vent breaks into the lobby a few minutes after Polly and S4r4 started the tour, making a drunkard scene. A guard tries to get rid of him with a tazer before too much attention and people are drawn, and we roll dice. This time it's a failure and Vent ends up thrown out of the building.<br/><br/>Now it's S4r4's torn to act. We roleplay a bit how Donovan is showing them the place, then S4r4 asks for a computer terminal to help her camera sort and prep the footage shot so far. An employee (Judith) is pushed aside and S4r4 starts hacking the office LAN while attempting to show legit video editing activities on screen. Roll, success, the team has the needed data (3/5 progress).<br/><br/>And here is were we might have done a big error.<br/>We thought it was not challenging to just "get out" now that the info was stolen and no ones seemed to be the wiser, so the next round was played somewhere else. Again we had to re-think what to do, eventually setting the scene at the private shuttle station where (in a flashback) S4r4 set up fake documents and invitations and shuttle tickets, while Vent and Polly faced the airport security checks and personnel. This made the established elements (Donovan and the office cameras) <b>totally irrelevant</b> :P<br/><br/>Were we supposed to stick to the original situation, at the corp offices? Were we supposed to come up with unexpected obstacles and problems, to keep the action there?<br/><br/>Then as mentioned early in this post we get on the shuttle and have to re-think the whole 2nd scene, we do the Plan part, then the game ends because it was too late in the night. We played a total of 3 hours and a half.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441687/#Comment_441687" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-19T13:15:34+00:00" title="January 19, 2015  1:15PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we played the second part of the game, and it took 3 more hours.<br/>We mostly solved our problems of framing by having the GM play a stronger and clearer role, re-capping the current situation and spelling out the obvious dangers ahead, taking charge of re-thinking the situation a bit if needed.<br/><br/>Coming up with Anecdotes still didn't feel natural nor easy. We put more effort in telling them the way the rules suggested, and they came out nicer and funnier <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>But it still felt forced; they were too important dice-wise not to be used, but it always felt as a disjointed part of the game.<br/><br/>Also we felt quite "left hanging" by the lack of any mechanic or word about the ending of the game. You roll dice to perform an action, you get some successes and... the game ends. Are the Boss promises fulfilled? Are the PGs extracted safely? What are the consequences of our last job?<br/><br/>In the end it might just have been a problem of expectations. The game doesn't create an engaging narrative, doesn't offer interesting human choices ... nor it pretends to, so I think we just assumed and expected them because that's what our group likes. Instead the game gave us a good platform to re-enact the clich\xe9s of a specific genre; which is fun, just not our cup of tea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
