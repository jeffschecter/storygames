The sessions will be held in the GameFarm IRC channel, (http://www.mibbit.com/chat/?server=irc.otherworlders.org&amp;channel=%23GameFarm). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first topic will be "Answering the 3 Design Questions" which was borrowed from a 2005 game design seminar at GenCon SoCal. Further details are posted at GameFarm blog (http://gamefarm.wordpress.com/2009/09/26/three-design-questions/).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you there! --Shane, GameFarm"<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll be there! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--Jonathan "fudgebob" Susara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
