For the purposes of these follow-up threads, please can we consider that suggestion as a given.)<br/><br/>Lots of people had problems with NPCs. These include: naming your NPCs, giving them a variety of personalities and motives, and making them consistent.<br/><br/>The names. Usually I do make a list of names before the game. Last session I didn't and it showed - I dug around on the iPad, and while the names were real, I was slow coming up with them, and they weren't always memorable. But when I do, I mark the NPCs details next to the name on the list.<br/><br/>In the Keeper's Resource Book, we introduced Three Things. Each NPC has a physical mannerism - you can do this at the table; an attitude, accent or verbal tic (this can also be a real person you are attempting to imitate); and an adjective. Put those down next to the PC's name and it's likely you'll play them consistently. When you are imitating someone, it must be a sufficiently bad imitation that they can't tell who it is. A couple of times (rather naughtily) I've imitated the players.<br/><br/>Eg drums fingers, speaks quietly and gently , accomodating, <br/><br/>This one was a Bulgarian gangster in Madrid from last week. The three things were tactile, sweary Zoltan, friendly.<br/><br/>Tactile (I held out my arms as if to embrace the player)<br/>Constantly referred to having sex with character's female relative. He was also a bit like Zoltan from Flash Gordon.<br/>Friendly and loyal<br/><br/>I could really do with a lovely NPC record table which included this info plus a few other details, or even better, an iPad app which did this with some optional random generation.<br/><br/>I suppose if I was brave enough I could ask which personality types I tend to overuse, and attempt to use adjectives which don't do this. <br/><br/>What do you do?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362227/#Comment_362227" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T02:15:56+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  2:15AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends on the NPC.

Three is too many for me. The biggest trouble is keeping track of these things.<br/><br/>The "Lost Procedure That Worked Well" for me, which I'm re-implementing <i>now</i> is to record NPCs on a sheet with 16-20 boxes on it: one NPC per box. When a sheet becomes full, transfer the NPCs that are still relevent to a fresh one. When a box becomes too small to hold an NPC, that NPC gets a separate sheet. (Or I guess I could have an intermediate stage with 4 NPCs per sheet.)<br/><br/>Second procedure I'm re-implementing <i>now</i>, is to roll a die to choose the sex. Odd will be female and even a male, dice that fall on the floor are other. (Even being males is a bad joke in Finnish -- basically "having a pair", which makes it easy for me to remember and be consistent about it.)<br/><br/>Third procedure I'm re-implementing is lists of names, but not sure if I have time to do it for tonight...<br/><br/>I would like to start using pictures for NPC more consistently, but I'm not sure how to manage that. I don't tend to collect clippings like that, and don't seem to have the google-fu for effective image searches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362244/#Comment_362244" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T04:34:07+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  4:34AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think about motivation for NPCs.

I still go into a game without a list on most days, because I'm lazy. It's something I should start doing more rigorously.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned in the other thread I've also adopted a <i>random roll for assigning gender</i>. This has helped a lot in creating more interesting characters with less cliche roles.<br/><br/>Finally, I use a <i>random motivation roll</i>, of which I'm quite proud of. In its most basic form, this has two results:<br/>-the NPC wants out of her situation<br/>-the NPC wants to preserve her situation<br/>This means no NPC is ever just there, lounging in a status quo zone. The roll must be interpreted according to the situation, which is not always easy, but it certainly beats just me falling into a routine.<br/><br/>So basically, first I need a context, for example, the PCs are at an inn and one says "I go talk to the bartender." <br/>First off I need a name. Sometimes I also need a profession, but in this instance we already know the person is a bartender.<br/>Next, gender. The dice say this is actually a woman. Cool.<br/>Finally, motivation. Maybe the dice say the NPC wants out. Her position is not happy. She's stuck with this inn, but her dream in life is to do something different, she wants to get rid of it. Or maybe she's in an unhappy marriage. Or debt. <br/>Maybe the dice say the NPC wants things to stay the way they are. Her position is threatened. Someone wants to buy her inn, but she doesn't want to sell, even if she's in massive debt. Or maybe her husband is intent on leaving her and she wants to save the marriage.<br/><br/>So that's pretty much a fully playable character there. What I need to work on are descriptions, roleplaying cues like the ones described in the posts above. What is the NPC wearing? What are their mannerisms? Clothes? Accent? I'm trying to find a nice, compact solution to being better with that (other than just a big random table).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362283/#Comment_362283" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T07:40:44+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  7:40AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Finally, I use a<i>random motivation roll</i>, of which I'm quite proud of.

It's a good, easy trick.<br/><br/>Typical character traits are things like "brave", "old-fashioned", "arrogant", "nurturing". Simple motivations are best described in Apocalypse World: this character has a simple drive towards something, they follow around one of their body parts and do what it wants, all the time.<br/><br/>If the NPC gets more screen time, then you subvert that simple beginning. Either give them the opposite character trait simultaneously (someone who is Brave *and* Cowardly is by definition a pretty interesting character), or give them a surprising "except when" clause (so that guy who is incredibly Arrogant... EXCEPT when it comes to learning about the Lost Continent, or rock music: then the character transforms into a humble, devoted, wide-eyed fan/learner). <br/><br/>That kind of juxtaposition makes a character interesting, gives a sense of depth, almost immediately. It's a contradiction, and it's unexpected: it suggests more below the surface.<br/><br/>However, in practice I find that knowing <i>what the NPC wants from the PCs</i> is usually more than enough for effective NPCs, with the details (like personality) flowing pretty naturally from that once the game is in play at the table. (The players react to your NPC like they're a fun, party person? Why, now they are. Make use of their assumptions!) This part depends greatly on the game system, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362563/#Comment_362563" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T04:13:08+00:00" title="February 25, 2012  4:13AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>If the NPC gets more screen time, then you subvert that simple beginning.

I think of some important aspect of one of the PCs, some challenge or choice facing them or something they've done. Then, I flip that choice and that's my NPC.<br/><br/>FREX:<br/>In the Avatar the Last Airbender game I'm running with Lady Blackbird rules the PC Keela is on the run from an arranged marriage, seeking freedom. She ends up fighting a water bender who was trying to capture her and take her back home. She defeated the water bender, named Hong Tse Dau. Hong immediately begs to serve her, swearing fealty. Now Keela the noble, trying to live like a peasant with the street kid she loves, is being followed around by a woman who constantly seeks to serve her, to let Keela's will shape her sense of self.<br/><br/>It lets me push on the main pain points of the PCs through constant reminders and conversations about their challenge, issue or choice. Plus, its really easy to play them. I just say pretty much the opposite of what the player says, but come up with some generally logical underpinning for their worldview. <br/><br/>In a group of PCs, I will often choose to mirror a PC not present in a scene if I can get away with it. It lets me push the player of that PC indirectly, lets the player of another PC have a chance to talk about their issue and bring it to the fore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413883/#Comment_413883" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-10T08:57:59+00:00" title="May 10, 2013  8:57AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great technique.

I tried to narrow down what it is about the easy-to-play characters, and came up with the following:<br/><br/>1) Honest: The character says what\u2019s on their mind, even when it\u2019s not in their best interests.<br/><br/>2) Cynical: The character doesn\u2019t have any illusions about the world, their place in it, or the chances of things changing any time soon.<br/><br/>3) Opinionated: The character has strong opinions, and will share them with you given even the smallest opportunity, or even no opportunity at all.<br/><br/>4) Driven: The character cares about one thing, and only that thing.<br/><br/>5) Hostile: The character doesn\u2019t like the players\u2019 characters, and will take every chance to show it.<br/><br/>6) Friendly: The character just wants to please, just wants to be liked, just wants to be helpful.<br/><br/>7) Intellectual: The character is better read, more educated, and more informed than you would expect for their position.<br/><br/>8) Morose: The character has other, weightier things on their mind. Perhaps their love life, or a missing pet (or something more serious).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413916/#Comment_413916" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-10T16:33:34+00:00" title="May 10, 2013  4:33PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Easy-to-play characters can generally be summed up with a couple of snappy traits, like you describe.

Way too often - even in story games - I find that GMs play the NPCs as if they know what is going on, and aren't going to be pushed around by the PCs.  It makes a huge difference when you have a bunch of NPCs who are humble, confused, and/or ignorant.  </blockquote>\nI can personally verify that this is awesome and it totally works. <br/><br/>It also worked very well for addressing a sort-of problem I had in many of our games, which was increasing bloodthirstiness among the players, aka "TAKE NO PRISONERS" syndrome. Having enemies who not only wanted to surrender but were absolutely willing to sell out their bosses in exchange for...well, for anything that meant they wouldn't be another +1 to the body-count seemed to break that spell. The notion that interrogating someone could actually produce more than snide "I know the answer to that, but I'll never tell <i>you</i>" stonewalling really shouldn't have been something we arrived at so late in our gaming careers. So embarrassing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
