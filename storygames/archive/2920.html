Sometimes it is hard-coded in the rules ("The player opposite you provides adversity"), and sometimes it exists on the social level ("Somebody needs to keep things on track and that person is obviously Sarah").<br/><br/>I'm interested in the latter - the social distribution of authority in GM-less play.  What structures emerge, in the absence of rules or in spite of them?  How is GM-less play facilitated at your table?  <br/><br/>From my perspective, one trend I see quite often is a true facilitator emerging - typically the person most enthusiastic or knowledgable about the game at hand (look to the guy who brought the book to fill this role).  This person often serves as procedural resource and pace-keeper.  Another social role I've seen pretty regularly is the guy who is alert to the meta-narrative and consistently challenges fellow players to step up ("That was weak.  I want to hear more about that.  Set the scene for us.")  I'm sure there are many more, and in all sorts of interesting combinations.

Certainly in convention play, when I'm basically teaching a game to new people, I'm initially assuming the mantle of Authority, Enforcer, ATC, and Adversary.  Practically (gasp!) behaving like a GM!  Usually as the game progresses I can see other people warming to particular bits of authority, and can back off.  Usually Enforcer and Adversary get discretely handed off by the ninety minute mark, but I remain Authority and ATC.

I play a lot of one-shots with a varying group.  And even when it's a GM-less game, people tend to look at me as the GM since I'm usually the one with game in hand.<br/><br/>Another archetype I see is the <b>Designer</b>.  He's not playing the game for fun as much as he is dissecting the rules to uncover their weaknesses.  These players can be a little annoying as they won't let the game be the game.  I prefer to do a braindump after the session about what worked and what didn't.<br/><br/>There is also the <b>Funny Guy</b>.  He is empowered by not having a GM to "stop" him.  So he looks at where the edges of the game are and tries to push them, mainly for comedic value.  "We are in 19th century England?  Cool, I want to be the guy with a steam-powered laptop."<br/><br/>Note that I see both of these types of players in games with GMs, but they tend to be more disruptive in GM-less games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66420/#Comment_66420" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T13:53:11+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  1:53PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh the Funny Guy!

Bill beat me to it, but lte me offer my suggestions as well.</p>\n<p>I see the roles already named as falling into some broad categories based on what they affect:</p>\n<p><strong>Answer-Focused Roles</strong> include Rules Sages, Rules Lawyers, Authorities, and any other roles focused on providing answers to questions that rise in the game within their area of expertise. Positive versions will be sought out by the other players (like the history buff being asked to suggest useful color.) Negative versions interject their answers, even when unasked (like the rules lawyer who argues every point.) Other examples would include the False Authority, the Living Chronicler (distinguished from an ordinary Chronicler,) and Odds Maker.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics-Focused Roles</strong>, such as the Air-Traffic Controller or the Bookkeeper (player who writes down treasure,) is focused on doing things to the game itself: doing the math in a game that requires lots of calculation, recording treasure found and working out expenses, laying out map tiles (or mapping, in old-school dungeon crawls.) I'm coming up blank on specific negative examples for this, but they would be something likeplayers obsessing over economic strategies in a Traveller game when the other players don't care.</p>\n<p><strong>Fiction-Focused Roles</strong>, such as the Adversary, the Water-Bearer, or one interpretation of the Funny Guy, are concerned about what's happening fictionally, either the dramatic tension, the internal consistency, gaps in the setting, or new avenues of exploration. Positive versions of these roles keep the the fiction entertaining for all; negative versions try to control or derail the fiction for their own purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Group-Focused Roles</strong>, such as the Opponent, the Yes-Man, or the Vibe Taker, pay attention to group interactions and either keep them working (positive) or derail them (negative.)</p>\n<p>Some of the roles are hard to sort into these categories, but I'm not sure if it's because there are some missing categories or they are combos of one of the above. One problem is that any of the negative roles will affect the group; the more self-centered the behavior, the more it's going to seem like pure, negative group-focus ("it's all about ME!")</p>\n<p>A side note about the Funny Guy: Chris's original phrasing makes it sound like a potentially-positive role (pushing the fiction creatively in a humorous direction,) but the follow-up references to the Funny Guy sound more like a negative role (using humor for self-centered focus.) Maybe Chris meant the latter, but then there's no real difference between the Funny Guy and King Gonzo.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66586/#Comment_66586" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T11:55:29+00:00" title="May  2, 2007 11:55AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite><strong>Mechanics-Focused Roles</strong>, such as the Air-Traffic Controller or the Bookkeeper (player who writes down treasure,) is focused on doing things to the game itself: doing the math in a game that requires lots of calculation, recording treasure found and working out expenses, laying out map tiles (or mapping, in old-school dungeon crawls.)

Alternately, misusing and abusing mechanical power, such as an Air Traffic Controller type who uses the mechanics to keep shifting the spotlight onto themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66589/#Comment_66589" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T12:01:40+00:00" title="May  2, 2007 12:01PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are definitely edge cases, like The Adversary, who can be great or awful but not much else.

Group members take on roles, or more precisely they enact repertoires of communication behaviors that stabilize into roles.  Task role behaviors include initiating processes and group actions, requesting information, giving information, facilitating procedures, requesting opinions, giving opinions, clarifying, summarizing and evaluating. Group maintenance role behaviors include giving social support, harmonizing, relieving tension, energizing, leading, following, compromising, and gatekeeping. Self-centered role behaviors include "negative blocking" (nay-saying), dominating, attacking, and clowning around.<br/><br/>These are slightly different dimensions than the ones Jason's laid out, which seem to break down along the lines of engagement with (responsibility for) the rules, engagement with other players, engagement with game-fiction. There's some conceptual fuzziness on my part, though. Am I reading you right, Jason?<br/><br/>Talysman's four-fold breakdown of answers, mechanics, fiction, and group seems like a good start. What's the difference between answers and fiction?

I was focusing on the first part and interpreting it as handling mechanical procedures for the group, keeping track of who has initiative order and things like that. Of course, if you focus more on the second part, and if spotlight time is not apportioned mechanically, then Air Traffic Controller sounds more like a Group-Focused role. I think several of the roles already proposed are kind of murky, mixing both tasks and relations.</p>\n<p>Group-Focused roles, at least the way I interpret them, are pretty much identical to relational orientation roles. The other three are all task-oriented, but broken down into kinds of tasks necessary for role-playing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>creating the fiction your group is building;</li>\n<li>manipulating numbers, dice, or other fiddly bits; and,</li>\n<li>recalling factual information independent of the fiction (rules, historical or technical information, inspirational material.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, the difference between Answer-Focused roles (in relation to rules specifically) and Mechanics-Focused roles is: one role recalls the rules of the game, the other applies them. It's the difference between the player who remembers all the DR, PD and hit point values of spaceship armor in GURPS versus the player keeping track of how much damage the ship has taken in different locations. In some cases, that's the same player, but it doesn't have to be. And either role may overlap with the Fiction-Focused role, a player who remembers what fictional details have been established about this class of spaceship, or that spaceship continuity guy may be someone else entirely.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66658/#Comment_66658" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T04:50:20+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  4:50AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi guys!
