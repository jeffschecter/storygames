It seems like a game to jump directly of the good parts of an Ars Magica campaign. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish">@CoveredInFish</a> we did almost exactly that at Go Play NW this year. Me, <a href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">@tony_dowler</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/SevenSidedDie">@SevenSidedDie</a> and Doug-whose-username-I-can't-find made an Ars Magica-esque conclave as our Kingdom: <b>the Covenant of Librum Nox</b>. It was supposed to mean "Book of Night" but we might have muffed our Latinese.<br/><br/>It was pretty fantastic. We had a library-labyrinth at the heart of our enclave. Only the wisest mages could pass its hidden wards and find their way to the innermost chambers (and the most arcane tomes). We were low-key most of the game, keeping our magic hidden from the world around us. We wanted no part in the petty affairs of kings, but all the land around us was in danger of getting pillaged by the armies of feuding Dukes and warlords.<br/><br/>Our final Crossroad was whether we should abandon our low profile and awaken the giant that slept beneath the mountain and use it to destroy the armies. It was our ancient duty to ensure that the mountain giant slumbered unseen -- a legend from myth only -- but hey, drastic times, drastic measures.<br/><br/>Prediction: if we awaken the giant, we won't be able to control it. Good times.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426488/#Comment_426488" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T14:15:56+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  2:15PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!

The young turks just didn't recognize who they were dealing with. That bumbling old man who likes to brew beer and teach apprentices good cooking? He breezes past the wards that the ambitious young mage has been struggling to wrap her mind around for days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish" title="CoveredInFish"><img alt="CoveredInFish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/940/nWJ86I3UKR7RA.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish">CoveredInFish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426590/#Comment_426590" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T00:11:25+00:00" title="January  4, 2014 12:11AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sound great.
