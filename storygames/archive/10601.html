Recently, there was a design contest at a local mini-con and we got a total of five submissions. The winner was a generic game system that's been under development for a while now and has been published as a series of free work-in-progress pdfs on a couple of forums, under a CC-license. There are quite a few game shops, at least one of which also stocks international Indie games, but so far any austrian indie publishers have failed to really appear on the radar or get together or something.

At Concrete Cow, for example, I know I'll find a group of like-minded people to play games with.<br/><br/>There are various people plugging away at their own homebrew games. For example, Graham Spearing, a thoroughly nice bloke, is about to release <a href="http://www.wordplaygames.co.uk/index.html" rel="nofollow">Wordplay</a>, which combines elements of HeroQuest and Burning Wheel. I've played it and it's great.<br/><br/>There are many small press game companies, which aren't strictly "indie" in the sense of creator-owned. So we've got Cubicle 7, who published Starblazer Adventures and are working on the Doctor Who RPG. Pelgrane Press publish Trail of Cthulhu and Mongoose publish...everything. It's quite a mini-industry.<br/><br/>Next month, we have IndieCon, a small convention dedicated to indie games (in which it includes small-press games, like Starblazer and Trail). It's a tiny convention, but has a great atmosphere, and you get to stay and game in comfortable little lodges. Part of me hopes it'll thrive; part of me hopes it'll stay exactly the same size.<br/><br/>For a while, there was the Collective Endeavour, a group of indie game designers. They reorganised at the beginning of the year and, although some of the original members are still going, they're much quieter than they used to be. There seems, to me, to be a focus on their back catalogue rather than creating new stuff: their new products are largely variations on previous games.<br/><br/>Just so you know, I write for Pelgrane and used to be a Collective Endeavour member.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235176/#Comment_235176" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T05:01:29+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  5:01AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think most indie designers in the States purchase 2,000 copies that sit in their basement either-- although I know a few people who are talking about doing that, just because the offset printing prices are so much cheaper and then you don't have to worry about reprinting for quite some time.<br/><br/>In MY experience, not speaking for the whole country here, I write the game, do layout myself or for trade, outsource editing, and either get illustrations through trade or cheaply through stock imagery. Then I print 60 copies and stay annoyingly out of print for quite some time.<br/><br/>No money exchanged hands for anything done with It's Complicated except for the actual printing.

Let me answer for Japan, because how the Japanese do Indie make us Forge/PostForge-folks look like Alliance Distro*.\n<blockquote><br/>* They are made by a single person, who designs, writes, edits and layouts, though illustrations are often (but not always) outsourced.<br/>* Very little, if any, money is spent producing it. It's quite common to have illustrations done by friends or relatives for no cost.<br/>* They are sold through lulu.com, to a one. Nobody contacts a printer and gets 2,000 copies that sit in their basement.</blockquote>\nI'll answer point by point to the above, then talk about some important distinctions.<br/><br/>1) The crew: Some are totally done by a single person, who does writing, layout (MS Word), and sometimes get a friend to do an illo or two for free/cheap. Others are done by one person from start to finish: Illos, layout, etc all done by one person. Finally, some games are designed in "circles", basically "my gaming group", where everyone contributes a little: Writing, layout, art, content, and all equally split profits. There are a few exceptions which look like *our* indies: One person owns the project and does a majority of the text, then pays a friend to do layout, another acquaintance or friend paid to do art. This is how Kamiy Ryo (MAID, Sunset Village, Absolute Slavery) does his gig, and few others operate like that.<br/><br/>2) Everyone other than the aforementioned Kamiya Ryo: Yep, most illos are free or cheap, usually paid in social capital (give you a copy, offer you a dinner somewhere, return a favor in another way, etc). When folks contribute an illustration to a manga, it's usually as a favor, and for free. <br/><br/>3) They will see a printer, always a local print office in Japan. Most folks will print about 100-200 copies of their game. Some, if they have something they expect to sell more, may print a few hundred more copies of their game. They will usually have them delivered directly to the event they intend to sell at (in this case, the Komiket, the largest comic convention in the world), and any that are left over will go home with people to put in their closets.<br/><br/>Here's more:<br/>* Indie games and supplements are sold at a price between $3-5: At Cost, Plus 1-2 Bucks. Sometimes, in rare cases (with more illustrations and prettier layout) they will price them at up to $8.00, or even in VERY rare cases $10. There's only one designer who charges more than that (Kamiya) due to the effort/money/quality put into the product, but even in that case we're still looking at less than $12-15. <br/>* There are a few unique indie games and supplements. Many of them, though, are an unlicensed fan version/conversion of an anime, manga or movie into an RPG form ("Revolutionary Girl Utena: The RPG" "GURPS Conversion for all Gundam Mecha", "GURPS: My Homebrew Dark Fantasy Game", etc).<br/>* I won't get into Replays here, but a majority of indie gaming product are Replays, not Games.<br/>* Most are sold at one or two large indie-centric conventions (the equivalent of the Staple! convention in Austin). Most folks will sell there, and if they have leftovers, give them to friends or sell the few remainders online through very basic/simple webpages. <br/>* Most transactions over the web are handled by Direct Bank Money Transfer. While credit cards are not nearly as shunned as they used to be, most transactions in Japan are traditionally direct transfer, which are incredibly easy and inexpensive (you can do it over the web).<br/>* Most indie designers will not participate in a "You buy my game; I'll buy yours" transfer: They'll just give you a copy of their game. And you'll give them a copy of yours. <b>Games within the community of designers are traded, not sold</b>. Of course, a designer may pick up 1-2 more copies of the game for friends (buying them) to show solidarity and the like. But all indie designers bring product to their convention, acknowledging in advance that a percentage of their copies will be set aside for trades with other designers. This saves everyone both Money and Bullshit.<br/><br/>If you watch the anime "Genshiken", in its second season, you will see pretty much exactly what it looks like to produce an indie manga in Japan; RPGs are pretty much the same.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* (that is, while the operation is entirely in control of the owner, so they can do whatever they want, the culture is totally Fugazi: Low cost, Me-to-You, Let's Trade, etc)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peril%20Planet" title="Peril Planet"><img alt="Peril Planet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peril%20Planet">Peril Planet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235989/#Comment_235989" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T17:03:05+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  5:03PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2009 7:42AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Australia is pretty much the same as the rest of the world, it would seem. Creators traditionally work in isolation or in consultation / cooperation with their own local group of players - but it is always (in my experience) a single person that has ownership of the game. Art can be done by the creator, purchased in the form of stockart, or done for "mates rates" (either very heavily discounted or "swapped" for credit/ad space, free copies of the finished product, etc). Publication / distribution is primarily via PDF on the web (usually the author's own site though some also utilise places like RPGnow) or print on demand through Lulu. Indie games in brick-and-mortar stores are rare, but there are a few places that will reliably stock them - I do not know of any that currently stock Australian-made indie games. I think that there are creators that would like to have their games stocked but lack the knowledge, experience and confidence to step up to this (I am one of them - my game, Space Rat, has been sent to shops in a few countries but I haven't approached a local store...) This will hopefully change in the near future.<br/><br/>The vast distances between population centres means we are pretty wide spread and it has only been recently that a real local "community" has formed. This has been significantly helped by the presence of GenCon Oz which seems to be big enough to draw writers, artists and indie gamers from across the country (con's typically are much more localised and very wargame oriented - roleplayers stick to what and who they know). At this year's GenCon Oz a few of us got together and launched The Stockade to help nurture this local community of creators and it has been enthusiastically recieved and supported. Check it out at <a href="http://www.stockade.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stockade.wordpress.com</a>. We have also made some contacts with a store that is very keen to support the indie market and we will hopefully build this relationship as time goes on.<br/><br/>I think Andy's description of the Japanese community is very interesting - I sense from what he was saying about the Japanese swapping games that the US community do not do this. Australian creators have been pretty open and free with their products (I guess it helps that most games are free anyway). I know that Michael of Vulpinoid Studios gave away copies of his game Eigth Sea to every person that played at Gen Con Oz last year, and I handed many copies of Space Rat to other indie creators and fans. I really think this kind of sharing of ideas is a good thing!<br/><br/>Anyway, that's how I see things Down Under.<br/><br/>- Nathan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
