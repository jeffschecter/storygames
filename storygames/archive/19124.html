I thought I'd post up my thoughts and tips.<br/><br/>First off, fill out your profile. Give yourself an avatar and say something about your interests. This'll let people you circle know who you are and hopefully help clue them into why you circled them.<br/><br/>Next, post something publicly at least once a month. I tend to post most things publicly, saving private things for truly directed conversations. But even if you want to control things more tightly, a once (or twice) a month post about something you are interested in will let people know you are still an active member of G+.<br/><br/>Next you need to get some activity for your feed. I suggest starting small. This being a Story Games forum, I'll give you five people you really should have circled. Search G+ for your favorite game designers or bloggers and see if they have an active G+ profile.<br/><br/>Andy Kitkowski <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/106430054160848801055/posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/u/0/106430054160848801055/posts</a><br/>Jason Morningstar <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JasonMorningstar/posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JasonMorningstar/posts</a><br/>Vincent Baker <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+VincentBaker/posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+VincentBaker/posts</a><br/>Fred Hicks <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+FredHicks/posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+FredHicks/posts</a><br/>Nathan Paoletta <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/113171717066139475855/posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/u/0/113171717066139475855/posts</a><br/><br/>There are tons of cool people I've left off, but that'll give you a good start. Next find a few communities to join. Of course start with:<br/><br/>Story Games <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/105298743270221910970" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/105298743270221910970</a><br/><br/>But search around for your favorite games, they probably have groups too. I suggest setting your communities to "Show in Home Feed" but "Notifications Off". <br/><br/>Ok, now that you've got some real activity in your main feed, what do you do next? You want to start building your circles up to have active members who engage others. Look at your feed and find some interesting posts. Specifically ones that have spawned a good number of comments. The people who are commenting are the people you want to start circling. People who are active posters in your communities you should start circling. Don't go overboard. Maybe circle 10 new people a day for 10 days. That'll get you a solid base for a constant stream of gaming goodness. <br/><br/>And start posting! Definitely circle people who comment on your posts, or respond to your comments on other posts. The rest is up to you.<br/><br/>Jesse Butler<br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JesseButler/posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JesseButler/posts</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426866/#Comment_426866" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T14:17:32+00:00" title="January  8, 2014  2:17PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426874/#Comment_426874" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T17:08:47+00:00" title="January  8, 2014  5:08PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1!<br/><br/>If you circle me send me a message (there or here) and say hello; I will in turn put you in my cool guy friend circle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SGTillings" title="SGTillings"><img alt="SGTillings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SGTillings">SGTillings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426877/#Comment_426877" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T17:47:35+00:00" title="January  8, 2014  5:47PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2014 5:47PM by SGTillings.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A regular post on here over the next few days with interesting people from the community to follow might be quite good.

My hope was that I could establish myself as a solid G+ citizen and maybe over time more people would notice my posts and discussions would ensue.  I mostly post notes on board games or RPGs I've just played -- usually one or two particular features that jumped out at me.  I figure these might be conversation starters.  In reality, I usually get close to 0 responses.  This doesn't shock me (after all, the massive flow of posts in my own G+ feed is more than sufficient to drown out any given person) but it is a little disappointing.<br/><br/>The folks I've noticed having lively G+ discussions generally have one or all of the following:<br/>1) They post a lot.  Like, multiple times per hour during the workday.<br/>2) They link cool geek stuff from the internet before everyone else has already found it and linked it.<br/>3) They have already established audiences who are eager to hear about their projects.<br/>4) They have useful services to offer -- information about X, links to resources for Y, coupons, sneak peeks, etc.<br/>5) They discuss hot-button topics.<br/><br/>I don't know how accurate that is; I'm sure more active G+ users can confirm or deny.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't (and in most cases can't) do any of that stuff, so perhaps that limits my reach.<br/><br/>I also don't post a ton of replies to other people's posts, because I find it difficult to pick interesting stuff out of the constantly-evolving tide of posts in my feed.  I generally have to scroll through several screens of links, self-promotion, inside jokes, cons I can't attend, random topics that don't interest me, art, photos, and more in order to find one neat-sounding RPG discussion.  Then multiply that by 5 or 10 before I find one where I actually have anything valuable to contribute.  I dislike the effort, and usually just come to Story Games instead.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that there are two possibilities:<br/>1) I'm doing G+ all wrong<br/>2) it's not possible to get much out of G+ unless you put a lot more effort into it than a handful of scroll-throughs and a handful of posts per month<br/><br/>Folks who get a lot out of G+, if you could enlighten me, I'd appreciate it!<br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DavidBerg/posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DavidBerg/posts</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426885/#Comment_426885" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T21:42:10+00:00" title="January  8, 2014  9:42PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My G+ experience has been more or less the same as yours, Dave.

The two are mildly related (mostly, social media has been eating forums lunch for a while, not necessarily g+), since I stopped using forums mainly to preserve my time and sanity. <br/><br/>G+ allows a much more curated feed of posts, since I simply don't circle people that I don't like, act trollish, or enjoy argument for the sake of arguments and so on (aka: a lot of forum posters, speaking in a very general way, and especially on other forums... I'm clearly still perusing S-G from time to time).<br/><br/>g+ communities are nice, but I found I rarely engage in them. I guess it just depends on my time availability and engagement in the subjects, though.<br/><br/>Being able to create a custom community on a whim is handy, though, as a form of "small forum" to talk about some subject with a modicum of privacy.<br/><br/>Other plus points of g+:<br/><br/>* Mobile application: I never check story-games from my phone.

It works better for seeing what your favorite indie designer is eating right now in Nepal or something. Maybe I just suck using it.<br/><br/>If someone can tell me how I can avoid seeing food or pets or selfies in g+, I'd be interested. And less promotion and more critique.

It's much easier to say how it is superior to general sites like RPG.Net or EnWorld. For me, G+ is my own personal gaming forum. I can circle who I'm interested in. My above tips are geared toward getting active members who participate in conversations, which is why I focus on circling people who are making comments. But much of the power is the ability to tailor the experience to what you are looking for. If you just want to be a reader, you could just follow bloggers and game designers.<br/><br/>The other powerful tool is tagging. You can start a private conversation with just one other or a few other people. As an example, I tagged John Wick to ask him if I could publicly share some game aids for a scenario he wrote. He quickly responded yes and wanted me to send him a copy. There are a lot of cool designers I've been able to engage in conversations in a way I wouldn't have tried via email or other methods.<br/><br/>Public communities I find are mostly a way to find active posters with shared interests. There are only a few communities I specifically try and check on regularly. On the other hand, private communities are like your own private forum. I have a private g+ community for each of the four RPG campaigns I'm currently in. Two of those take place via g+ hangout and roll20. That's really helpful for between game discussions, posting reminders and game aids, and just general organization.<br/><br/>I will admit, most of my posts don't spark long conversations. But that doesn't mean they don't have value, more people are reading them than you may realize. And when I do have an interesting thought that spawns a great thread, it's very rewarding.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426903/#Comment_426903" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-09T11:03:00+00:00" title="January  9, 2014 11:03AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave M, you've actually been in my Roleplaying circle for a long time now.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  When you link to your blog posts, maybe you could include more of a teaser?

If you wait for someone else to start them, you'll be waiting.<br/><br/>Ask people polite questions if you're curious about what they're doing or what they think, and don't take it personally if they don't answer or answer shortly - they're probably busy.<br/><br/>Posting provocatively on G+ is awful; I don't recommend it. Ask your questions and present your ideas with as much honesty and generosity of spirit as you can muster.<br/><br/>If you aren't in someone's circles but you want to be, reply to their public posts. That's how they'll notice you. If they don't circle you immediately, again, don't take it personally, they probably had something else on their mind. Try again next time you have something to say.<br/><br/>If you try to start a conversation and it flops, you can blame your audience if you like, but there's only so much you can learn from that. My advice is to try to reach your audience again a different way. There are honest to goodness skills you can practice and cultivate. Find someone whose posts excite you and inspire you to reply, and see if you can figure out how they do it.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426941/#Comment_426941" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-10T02:51:29+00:00" title="January 10, 2014  2:51AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, +1.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426944/#Comment_426944" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-10T06:59:04+00:00" title="January 10, 2014  6:59AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, <br/>I suck at promotion (but I want to learn), I don't know what to put for the blog posts.

I don\u2019t have a problem with having loads of people in my circles, as for the most part they contribute interesting content, but I imagine as the circles get wider and wider I\u2019ll come up against the phenomenon of Internet dickheads, who lurk there in their hundreds of thousands. I think women get it worst- just click on a few random pages maintained by women and you\u2019ll find enough appallingly sexist/discriminatory comments, harrassment and bullying. I once spent about an hour reporting all the posts I found on my female +buddies\u2019 pages that contained comments like \u2018you look sexy girl\u2019 and \u2018I think I like you pussy taste\u2019 etc.   <br/><br/>The other problem I think I\u2019m going to find as my circles get wider is that some of my posts might be of interest to buddies in group A but not to those in groups B, C or D, forex the +buddies who might be interested in seeing cute pictures of cats might go \u2018Huh, \u201cplayer agency\u201d, \u201cfictional positioning\u201d, what the fucks\u2019 that?\u2019 [delete/decircle], and the ones that would be interested in hearing about my thoughts on co-GMing might see the cute pictures of cats, \u2019funny\u2019 GIFs and internet memes etc., and go 'Uh, pass the sickbag'.

Not sure about comments though.</blockquote>\nYes, I meant post. I wasn\u2019t talking about +ing people, I know about that, I was asking if you could have different circles, rather than just \u2018public\u2019 and \u2018private\u2019, so I could have one group of +buddies aware of posts about RPGs, and not internet memes and so on, and vice versa. But I think I\u2019ll just have to poke around under the bonnet/hood. \n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>Also, sometimes people have added me and I think cool, now I can follow what they\u2019re up to on G+, but then while checking out their page a few days later I find loads of posts that I didn\u2019t get alerts for. So why did they bother adding me then?<br/></blockquote>It's not symmetric. Just because they add you, it doesn't mean that you've added them (ie indicated an interest in their content). When they add you, they see your content (I think).<br/></blockquote>\nNo, I realise that. What I meant was even when I\u2019ve added people, and they\u2019ve added me, I still don\u2019t see all of their posts. But I suspect the answer to this query is linked to the one above, i.e. they\u2019ve got different circles for groups of +buddies interested in different things. I think the clue is in Joe\u2019s reply below:\n<blockquote>If they've added you, posts you make <i>public</i> show up in their feed. <br/><b>snip</b><br/>I have one circle called "Friends" that holds all my contacts. And then I've got smaller circles, one of which is "Outfits and Clothing." I make some of my posts public, depending on how far-reaching and accessible I want them to be.</blockquote>\nSo, if a post is public, <i>all</i> the people you\u2019ve added will see it, whereas if it\u2019s <i>private</i>, only the circle labelled <b>cat pics</b> will see those ones, and only the circle labelled <b>gamers</b> will see posts about RPGs. In other words, I need to investigate how to build specific circles. It\u2019ll be a bother, but it\u2019s one illustration of the tremendous utility of G+. <br/><br/>Sorry, I was kinda thinking aloud there.

As such you probably don't _need_ or want a Google Page for your individual games. It's just going to be more overhead to manage and keep up with *unless* you want it to boost your searchability and then use that identity page to link onwards to other resources ...<br/><br/>Like your Communities, which are a _lot_ more important.<br/><br/>The Page can post Publicly or to constructed Circles, which means you're having to do a lot of "push" style comms, and historically, we know people aren't fond of those. But Communities are exactly what they say, places fans of your game (or even a particular run of it) can get together and not only write with you, but each other. This is a much bigger engine. Post into your Community as yourself, and you get egoboo two ways -- one as an involved creator who cares about the folks that like his stuff, and a second burst as the *you* that creates stuff that people like. Some people can Circle the *you* as your account if they want to know more about what's going on in your life, etc, so you don't have to stop being an entity that has a life, ups, and downs, and writes about it. You still get to be a person. And some people will only care about the game or company and only follow the Community -- and that's fine too!<br/><br/>Don't worry about splitting your audience on G+. That worry only applies to systems in which you have exclusionary channels of delivery. On G+, you can multiply channels and because it's all part of the same stream at a top level view, it's still just one channel. The real concern is making stuff findable and managed, and Communities are really the silo core for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
