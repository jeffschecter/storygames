Been there? Read up on it? Okay!<br/><br/>Now, this game does a lot for Mad Scientists that I like. <br/><br/>1) Aesthetics and Drives count. You can do X better because you have an Utopia complex/are jealous and resent the success of others/want revenge/want to rule the world/are curious about what lies beyond. You have a certain style to the machines you create: cyberpunk, atomic age, raygun, pseudo-occult, and so on. Pity those only give penalties if youtry to drift.<br/><br/>2) A fairly comprehensive set of tables and charts for how to turn what you know (Axioms) into gizmos. <br/><br/>3) Havoc rules for why your inventions can't be made or maintained by anyone else besides yourself. <br/><br/>4) Madness bleeding into the world. <br/><br/>5) Cool rules for alternate realities and why they never seem to hold up well in the light of day. <br/><br/>6) All the basic stereotypes are mostly covered.<br/><br/>However, there are things that diminish my enthusiasm from what it could be:<br/><br/>1) Rules similar to Mage's Spheres. You can build a life form, but you need X amount of Axiom Y to give it improved senses, X of Axiom Z to give it natural weaponry, Axiom A to give it working wings, and so on. You must also be X cm. tall to ride this ride, with Y hair color, and AUGGHHH!!!! <b>No!</b> I want a system that lets my Mad Scientist build his creations right out of the gate! Enough of this <i>bildungsroman</i> shit! <br/><br/>2) In a similar vein, I want a lab to automatically give me the capacity to mass-produce, not have to buy that as a Merit. I want my army of Necrobots now! <br/><br/>3) I want it so that, if I want to play a Venture Bros.-themed game of cynical despair, I can do so, or I can flip a dial and play Girl Genius in the past, present, or in a wild sword &amp; sorcery setting, where a mad science substitutes for magic. <br/><br/>4) If the theme of The Madness of Genius must be hardcoded into the game (and why not?), then why not put them on a fulcrum opposite each other? The more talented you are in Mad science, the more your real-world skills suffer, and the more you try to get your head out of the clouds, the harder it is for you to summon up the intensity necessary to have a breakthrough. There really is no need for multiple levers and dials on the character sheet. Save it for the inventions!<br/><br/>5) And one last thing: To make life simpler, have the players be the ones who roll for everything, and the GM sets the difficulty numbers. <br/><br/>That's all I want. Is that so much to ask?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187030/#Comment_187030" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T21:45:30+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  9:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well geez, if it's such a good idea, maybe you should go <i>invent</i> it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187055/#Comment_187055" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T04:06:32+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  4:06AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>Well geez, if it's such a good idea, maybe you should go<i>invent</i>it!</blockquote>\nI knew someone was going to say that.<br/><br/>My response: I suck at mechanics. I have a million settings and a hundred ideas for RPGs. What I do not have are the math skills necessary to fuel play. And for this game, I'd rather take the System Does Matter Approach and have this game be all about Mad Science, the way that Sorcerer is all about Devil's Deals. And while you could drift it into Venture Bros. dark comedy, or Ghostbusters slapstick, or supers with powersuits and gadgets, or an odd Sword &amp; Sorcery setting, at the core, it's all about Mad Science, and the Dark Side of Genius. It's a niche waiting to be filled. <br/><br/>So you see my dilemma.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187082/#Comment_187082" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T07:14:32+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  7:14AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: spookyfanboy</cite><br/>That's all I want.

If you want a game about themes of genius and madness where you can do all the mad science stuff right out of the gate... I think a game "about" mad science probably isn't what you want.<br/><br/>See, here's what <b>I'm</b> thinking: I'm thinking of an elaborate set of charts that you could plug just about any weird-ass invention into, and stat it. Whether it's a psychic technique that prevents you from having to eat, drink, or go to the bathroom, or if it's an ENIAC-sized orgasm-bomb, I want to be able to plug it into those charts and stat it up. <br/><br/>In order to "purchase" that invention, I want very simple and elegant mechanics that force me, the player, to choose between thinking of a more mundane solution, or going deep into loony-land to get that device, with the fallout that entails. Other than getting enough "oomph" to get the gizmo built, I do not want any elaborate mechanics. I also want mechanics that temporarily reward you for getting ethically greasy in order to build your gizmo, or indulge in the darker sides of your personality. <br/><br/>I'm thinking of how to make those charts work for gizmos, aliens, cryptids, pocket worlds, and so on, so that the guy or gal building that rocket has some interesting encounters out there in space. <br/><br/>I'm also thinking of perhaps borrowing from Vincent Baker with Concessions, in that you can achieve victory, but there are things about it that make it less than ideal. Your solar lamp for killing hemophages needs blood as fuel to work, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187237/#Comment_187237" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T13:55:47+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  1:55PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But again, if you can do all of that and literally stat out anything you want, where's the part of your game that has the inventions fighting or whatever?

I use Atomic-Create to make a Radium Laser or Biotech-merge to create robots made with Robotics-Create with a cloned human brain (mine of course!).<br/><br/>Now, you roll a die for the noun and one for the verb and hope they come out the same number.  The difference and direction between the two is bought off in "cruel fates" for the creation.<br/><br/>Example: I roll by Robotics-Create to make my robots.  Both at 1d4.

I forgot that in Ars Magica, you want to get close enough knowledge-wise to make your spell work, and hope the die does the rest. That is what I'm aiming for, with add-ons in the form an Inspiration-analog (similar to Moochava's Inspiration, but more refined to what I want it to do), drives, passions, aesthetic sense, and character proclivities. What I do NOT want is like Mage where you have to have Sphere-analog at THIS rank to even attempt to do something, plus other Sphere-analogs at THIS rank to customize. <br/><br/>I also do not want the loosey-goosey feel of Eldritch Ass-Kicking, a game I happen to enjoy quite a bit. I want the creation charts to matter.

Pick a number, say 6. Now count from your number to 10. That's how many dice you get for making your Inventions or Processes. Every number from one up to the number <i>before</i> the number you picked is the amount of dice you have to succeed at real life: dating, accounting, repairing stuff without 'tweaking' it, being social, keeping your job, remembering mundane stuff like where you parked, and so on. <br/><br/>To add to these dice, either side, you add your Influences: You could have wealth, a social circle involving important people, a passion for cooking, a drive to explore caves/the stars/the past/the future, etc., a love interest, children, an impulsive streak, a good education in psychology/the humanities/physics/computer science/the occult, etc. Each of these tidbits gives you bonus dice for certain situations, and should be written such that, in theory, they could benefit either side of the fulcrum. <br/><br/>Basic system would be d10s, add 'em up and beat a total. You can add five points to every roll by stating a Concession, something that would make your victory (however small and temporary it may be) less than ideally successful in a meaningful way. If you're inventing some piece of 'weird science', that Concession will last for the life of the invention/procedure. In order to remove that, you have to pretty much start over again, although the GM should grant a bonus for previous research. <br/><br/>I guess conflict would work the same way, which screams for a system whereby the GM sets difficulties and the players do the rolling to determine the outcome.  I guess most difficulties will be based in increments of 5 to 10. Ideally, there should be some way to use those Influences against the character, as long as the player gets some sort of reward for those. <br/><br/>The conflict stems from the incrementally-creeping Nature of the Possibilities  side: if you invent something, experiment on something or someone, or in general use the Rube Goldberg approach when a sensible mundane solution is at hand, you risk bumping up your Possibilities side, until before you know it, you've been swallowed by your mad-science obsession and the Madness of Possibilities, and you become an NPC who has gone off the deep end. Or who has suffered some sort of tragic ending to his or her story. The only way to keep this from happening is to keep yourself connected to everyday people, and try to do right by them. Or at least, not be a scientific sociopath. <br/><br/>The problem at this point is: making the chart that has those basic difficulties. Determining how to set them for mundane tasks, because that's what the GM's primary function will be, and s/he'll need all the help to do it. <br/><br/>This of course needs fleshing out. A lot of fleshing out. Mostly involving mechanics, and I hate slogging over mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
