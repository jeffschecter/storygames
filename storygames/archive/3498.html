I play a lot of RPGs, and the more I play the more I dislike rules detracting from awesome narratives.  Also, the "Story Games Community" picture was really cute.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, to make this more than just a "Hi! I'm new here!" post, a discussion question.  I hope this is in the right place, it's a fairly vague and out-there question.  Does anyone else use storytelling-centered games as foreign language learning tools?  Meaning anything from a casual round of Once Upon a Time (which I'm very tempted to buy in other languages), to a month of something like Lexicon, to any actual RPG campaign, all with people also interested in practicing another language (and having fun with it.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any experiences doing that, want to tell me about it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78956/#Comment_78956" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T22:13:12+00:00" title="June 30, 2007 10:13PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A long time ago there was <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2602&amp;page=1#Item_12" rel="nofollow">this thread over here</a>, but it's definitely a cool topic to revisit.<br/><br/>The only way I've personally done it is:<br/><br/>1) Teach myself Japanese by reading bunches of Japanese RPGs.<br/><br/>2) About 9 years ago, when I was teaching English to some students in Japan between consulting gigs, I had a classroom less on "I want", where the following happened:<br/><br/>I drew on the blackboard a white box. It was a Room. With three doors.  I drew three stick dudes, each with a different color. Each stick dude was the avatar of the "team".<br/><br/>The class was divided into three teams.  Person by person (they could consult in Japanese what they wanted to do next, but in English the next person in the team had to be the "Infocom Voice" and voice the command), they would tell me what they wanted their character to do:<br/><br/>"I want to open red door!"<br/><br/>"I want to pick up za... eto... rezokon? Ah, refrigerator! I want to pick up... refriger... THE refrigerator" <br/>etc<br/><br/>All the kids had a sheet of paper that listed all the verbs that the were supposed to have known by that time (about 16) that could be used in this game.<br/><br/>I would provide what they see next, drawing it on the board and explaining it in english ("You open the red door. In THIS room there is... a (etc)").<br/><br/>This was mostly junior high school students, and it was a total blast. <br/><br/>The part I remember most is this, because it was totally unexpected.  There was a room with two of the teams' avatars in them (blue and yellow), some objects, and a giant pit with spikes at the bottom. One member of the first team, a girl, said "I want to push BLUE PERSON in hole."<br/><br/>That was awesome, so it happened.  The blue team's avatar fell 20 meters and landed on giant spikes. I used red chalk to picture the mess.  Then I realized that it was the blue team's turn. I figured the class was just about over, but I asked them just for shits what they wanted to do next:<br/><br/>This otherwise non-responsive kid was beaming: "I want to FIGHT!" (using the English version of the word "Gambaru", which means to Try/Fight/Go for the Gold/ etc.).  That was so cool that I just had to use it. I said, "OK!" and then mimed like I was pulling myself off of spikes and climbing up 20 meters of pit wall, they climbed out of the pit and escaped alive. The class was in tears from laughing.  The best part was, "Fight" wasn't written on the paper they had, which was why it was even more of a success IMO.<br/><br/>Other than that, I personally played some RPGs in Japanese to try to learn, but got my ass kicked.  I also conducted a totally bilingual D&amp;D 3E game literally days after it was released (it was probably the first D&amp;D 3e game ever played in the nation), going back and forth in both languages as we had an English gameday (I was DMing) where some Japanese folks came to play; they wanted to play, but weren't too confident in the language.  It kinda gives me a headache to go back and forth like that, and if nothing else it was a language experience for me, not really to teach the others.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about it a lot, but it turns out that adventure gaming is ripe for language teaching. Actual roleplaying, for folks that are really into roleplaying, can be hella frustrating: You want to speaka certain way, say certain things, etc, but you just don't know the words.  Can be irritating.  When you're learning the language through sword attacks and 5 foot steps, etc, that's a lot easier IMO.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78957/#Comment_78957" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T22:16:38+00:00" title="June 30, 2007 10:16PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...
