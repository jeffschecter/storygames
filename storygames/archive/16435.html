Everyone runs it differently due to some deliberate incompleteness in the setting.<br/><br/>The way I run it...<br/><br/>I like to start the Mystery Agents in a drab waiting room with stale magazines, decaf coffee, and something quirky like the elevator music version of Back in Black coming from the speakers.  I take them through a breifing with a Green level agent that gives them the details of the patient, their crime, and possible hooks into their thought processes or environment.  Next is the trip to the operating theater where they meet their control agent and conduct the dive.  From there they get a little psychobabble and go under, the team leader (usually chosen at random) goes to green level and gets a tropical island and a surface impression of the patient and then heads to blue level (usually via a dream-like elevator) to act as a beacon for the rest of the team to lock in on (if they make their rolls.)<br/><br/>Here I throw down the basic look and feel of blue city, I always have a map in my head and it always changes on each dive.  Rorschach inkblots make for good maps.  I've also used the human brain as a road map.  The city is mallable, but the players know that they need to get into the mind (literally) of the patient.  If I'm industrious, I'll have pregenerated events and locations where the patient might be.  I'll also have a custom static table for 'random events' has the players interact with blue city.  I also have some idea of what the hostile personality will look like when it manifests.  After all, that's why the agents are here.<br/><br/>How it plays out is left to the players, some check out from doing to much and scrub the mission, some nail the HP easily.  I've had players play it cool like psycho-dragnet and others go full Scott Pilgrim.  I generally give the HP some dreams powers that I foreshadow in the mission briefing or as the players navigate through blue city.<br/><br/>I hope that helps.  Players can burn through their heart rate slowly or like jack rabbits and you have to pace yourself as a GM.  'Winging it' really is the best advice since (to me) it is a very sand box-y game.  In general, I try to bring the weird and slightly unnervy feel of a dream that is out of control.<br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/>Funny thing, no one has met the spidermen or the girl yet.  That is something that I'd like to leave for a campaign or longer story arc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375786/#Comment_375786" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T22:13:42+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 10:13PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My games have gone better when I've made the Blue City very much like a normal city and a normal place, and let the Static do the work of introducing weird, surreal, and frightening things.

Starting in media res with no explanation makes the players feel the same shock and strangeness that their characters feel. Also, you get to start right away, which works so well in a one-shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375800/#Comment_375800" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T01:31:59+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  1:31AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joseph, I'll dig up some of my old adventure notes and email them to you and you can see if they're useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376906/#Comment_376906" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T07:45:19+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  7:45AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If none of the players have played before I like to offer them "The Full Lacuna Experience" (like what I ran for <b>Mathalus</b>)  in which everything is removed from the table but their agent sheets (the wonderful bubble-test ones), <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> pencils, 5 dice each (3 white, 1 red, 1 black), and the stack of Japanese 1-yen coins I use to track Static.

I especially recommend a soundtrack. <br/><br/>My personal advice is to wing most of the scenario, write a lot of static events (or don't write a defined list- I drew from a  crazy handout I wrote and had an event at every single static increase, but some people like it a little less crazy than that).

If it's a con I prefer to show up in full agent get-up and basically walk them through an agent orientation as they fill out the sheets - this is all about setting up an authoritarian control. Cut out side conversations, ask folks to remove all unapproved materials from the briefing table, etc (see <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1817" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1817</a> for my inspiration on this point).<br/><br/>From there I drop them into a car crash and force them to act when a policeman arrives and they have no documentation. There will be a folder (which I've also prepped) with a mission briefing on the dashboard, or in a trash can, or whatever. It's basic, straightforward - if you want you can drop hints that the target isn't actually a serial rapist or whatever, but it's fine to just let their trust in authority run wild. The first time I ran it they assumed the target was a major drug dealer just because I said he was 'intoxicated' on the mission briefing.<br/><br/>Then there's a break, a bubble sheet, and an actual break for both of us.<br/><br/>Then you drop them in and shit goes wrong. Control is high as fuck. They land in different places. They're targeted by a teenage rebellion. Their target isn't actually a criminal. And so on. The game is seeing where they go with it. <br/><br/>More details on my write-up here: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15201&amp;page=1#Item_5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15201&amp;page=1#Item_5</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Staxx" title="Staxx"><img alt="Staxx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Staxx">Staxx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377163/#Comment_377163" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T12:21:42+00:00" title="May  8, 2012 12:21PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I run my first ever session of Lacuna last night.
