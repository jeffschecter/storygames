It's often a non-issue, and probably not used enough. It's only ever been a problem when 1 player says NO to a trait, then the target chooses a different trait, and the same person says NO again. In general, I would like there to be a limit. If you say, "try something different" and they do, and there is still a problem... unless it is a major problem, I would let it go. <br/><br/>I like these rules but I would only play with them or play the games that require them with specific people (which is not a bad thing, there are different people I would play withe when it comes to competitive games vs cooperative games or free form games vs tactical games). I'm not talking strangers vs friends.

Just work it out. But nobody says "try a different way" without articulating either what rings false, or what they want instead, or both. So it's opening communication rather than shutting it down.

It never really seemed problematic; every time I received it I took it as a sign that my thing wasn't really pushing the other player's aesthetic and/or dramatic buttons, and so tweaked accordingly. It never came up for a contribution I was highly invested in, though. Just some opening scene-setting stuff, where it was easy to adjust.<br/><br/>Interestingly, we didn't play with the caveat that you have to explain how you'd like it to be different. I dunno if that was a lack in the original rules, or if we just didn't pick up on it. That aspect was a bit disconcerting, like I had to play a guessing game over what woulod satisfy the player. I decided to take it as a creative challenge, but it was rather harsh-feeling. I like the new rule better. On a similar note, I very much prefer "Try a different way" over "Do it differently!" I don't think I'd want to soften it any further, though, with "maybe" or "perhaps, if it's not too much trouble?" As long as we know it's open to negotiation, I'd rather make a clear, though soft, statement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The other phrase I've found to be problematic at times is "Draw a Card/That might not be so easy!" In that first Archipelago game, folks started calling 'Draw a Card" like over and over again; I think it was a reflexive gamer instinct: "Oh, this the 'roll dice to see if you succeed' mechanic. Ok, let's roll!" And I believe in the original Archipelago, it was a simple playing card that gave success or failure, not the ultra-cool selection of "Yes, but..." "No, but..." "Yes, and..." options the game has currently. Also, the new rules patch this nicely, only allowing one "that might not be so easy!" per scene, so you can't spam it.<br/><br/>I played a game just the other day, though, where that very scarcity prompted some "That Might Not Be So Easy" abuse. The game had taken an adversarial turn, and I found myself frantically busting out "TMNBSE" to try to prevent the other character from getting his way all the damn time. Bad form on my part, I'll readily admit. And it turned out I wasted the card draw on a relatively trivial action, because I was suddenly SURE the guy was going to go "and then I proceed to solve all my problems and win everything forever" and I panicked. It would have been far better to save the draw for the actual climax of the story, which came soon after.<br/><br/>I think it's significant that in that game, "Try a Different Way" was extremely under-used. Instead of course-correcting early on and communicating expectations to each other, we let the fiction roll on getting more and more disparate and uneven in tone, until it became a power struggle over both where the story went and what story we were even telling. Granted, we were only sort of half-invested in playing that evening to begin with, and started off rather silly. But "Try a Different Way" could still have helped us calibrate the story and get more on the same page.<br/><br/>One fascinating aspect of that whole experience: I would actually postulate that "Do It Differently" could have helped PREVENT blocking. A lot of my frustration in the game stemmed from other players contributing bits that sort of squelched or dampened elements that I had just introduced myself. If I had thought to say, "Try a different way--without invalidating what I just established," it could've done a world of good.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311208/#Comment_311208" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T22:07:31+00:00" title="February  4, 2011 10:07PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Wording is important.

Also, I didn't see intent behind calls for "New Choice" to get rid of "bad" ideas so much as to find stronger choices and get beyond the obvious, mundane answers that often first come to mind. Stronger choices could result or really wacky ones that were funny. I find it helpful to exercise my intuition and a ton of practice is needed to develop the right skills and habits in improv. There are also habits to "unlearn" like trying to think of clever answers and getting beyond "piss" and "poo" jokes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've never played it Archipelago, and I didn't know about its "Try A Different Way." I was toying around with the idea of designing a game that incorporates "New Choice."

There's an improv game in which you ring a bell every time to get people to change what they've just done.<br/><br/><i>"This steak is undercooked."<br/>[Bell rings]<br/>"This steak is overdone."<br/>[Bell rings]<br/>"This isn't a steak at all."<br/>[Bell rings]<br/>"I am a steak-pervert. Bring me seventeen juicy..."<br/>[Bell rings]<br/>"My steak just talked to me."<br/>[Bell doesn't ring, scene continues.]</i><br/><br/>Note what happens here. You begin with a dull statement. The bell rings to make it better. The second option <i>reverses</i> the statement, but that's dull too. The third and fourth options are desperate attempts to be creative: they are also dull. The fifth is pleasingly weird. It's a statement produced under pressure, blurted out, sprung from the depths of the unconscious. And that's what the game is for. It produces something nobody would ever have thought of saying.<br/><br/>So, if Try A Different Way does that, I really like it. I don't think it does, actually. But it would be cool if it did.

Among dicks, it could be used as "your idea is shit", but so could eye rolling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311232/#Comment_311232" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T06:53:05+00:00" title="February  5, 2011  6:53AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Among dicks" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311243/#Comment_311243" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T08:10:19+00:00" title="February  5, 2011  8:10AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>JDCorley, Graham, others: In my view, you can answer "Try a different way" with "nnnno, I think I want it this way", and that's okay.</blockquote>\nThat's too bad.

We've been experimenting with different ways to say the phrases.<br/><br/>3. we use it as a forward-looking veto, totally on my own preference and misunderstanding.

Maybe I and many of the folks I play with just have S-G brain damage, but most the games I play in have this phrase in the System mix in some form.  Most of the time it takes the shape of someone getting excited, leaning forward and exclaiming, "Oh! No Wait!  I know!  How about something more like this?"  They're most likely to do it when the original narration has been offered with some mixture of hesitancy or a tone that suggests that this-is-good-but-I'm-not-100%-set-on-it, but sometimes even when that's not the case.  In a group with some reasonable degree of trust, these offers are generally made and received with generosity.<br/><br/>And we were doing it with GM-less games and games like PTA long before TADW came along.  So maybe TADW is a little stronger or has more foot-stepping potential than then previous forms but I and others employ the phrase more in the spirit of the earlier non-explicit forms.<br/><br/>There were about fifteen people in a room late Saturday night riffing for a time on passive aggressive forms of TADW.  It was pretty amusing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311478/#Comment_311478" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T10:25:45+00:00" title="February  7, 2011 10:25AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got to play The Venetian Tragedy on that same night - btw - and TADW was not abused.

I haven't played a GM-less game with hidden information before - I felt immersed, I felt suspense, I felt mystery, and still had authorial authorness.
