It's a diceless engine tuned to campaign play in what she's describing as "warm-hearted adventure and slice of life play... a game of heroic innocents growing up against a backdrop of strange events and haunting landscapes." A lot of the mechanical focus seems to be on making those small, personal, slice-of-life moments as interesting and significant as the big dramatic moments, and creating these genre-reinforcing feedback loops through the advancement system that remind me a lot of <i>Burning Wheel</i> in all the right ways. If the Kickstarter hits $80,000 we're also getting a campaign, <i>The Glass-Maker's Dragon</i>, that Jenna has described as the best thing she's ever written. Considering who that's coming from, I'm dying to see it.<br/><br/>It's fallen on me to post this since I'm responsible for the last few posts about it in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18446/stuff-to-watch-june-2013#Item_47" rel="nofollow">Stuff to Watch</a>, but frankly I'm intimidated by the task of summarizing this game. The only way I was able to explain <i>Nobilis</i> to people was to shove the Great White Book into their hands and watch them go from confusion to dawning awe (usually several times consecutively) until they were converted. Hopefully some of the people who've had a chance to playtest it can join us here and do a better job of giving a whole-system overview and maybe some Actual Play. <br/><br/>For now, is anyone else following this? And are you as in love with the Rats of Fortitude as I am? Because I need - <i>need</i> to play a rat with this:<br/>\n<blockquote><b>Affliction:</b> If I do that samurai move where I end up on the other side of someone with my sword extended, they may fall over dead or unconscious even if there\u2019s no physical way that move could have <i>happened.</i><br/><br/>Works on targets up to roughly elephant size.  </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rand_Brittain" title="Rand_Brittain"><img alt="Rand_Brittain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rand_Brittain">Rand_Brittain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417381/#Comment_417381" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T20:29:55+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  8:29PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2013 8:30PM by Rand_Brittain.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I was asked to come here and explain Chuubo to the good people of the world, so here I am!<br/><br/>Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine started out as an engine for "pastoral gaming," although it ended up being able to do a lot of other things as well. It's correct to say that it puts focus on the little things in life, so that spending time talking about your feelings and having a drinking party with your friends after the big magical incident is resolved becomes just as important as actually running out onto the Far Rooftops to find the bag of stolen stars.<br/><br/>You could compare it, I think, to games like Persona 3 &amp; 4, where managing your time spent with friends is a vital aspect of developing Tarot-themed omnipotence. It also resembles the recently-released Golden Sky Stories since they're both heavily based on the Japanese slice-of-life genre.<br/><br/>The other way to describe Chuubo is to say that it's a game engine based around foregrounding your emotional life. "Emoting," expressing a feeling without necessarily saying anything, is something that you do, and if you want to make progress there's a certain amount of connecting-with-others that needs to be done. The game also includes technology for what Jenna named Ritual Scenes. Have you ever been watching one of your favorite Japanese animes and suddenly somebody yells "Survival Strategy" and there's a bizarre technicolor scene in which people perform the same ritualized actions as last time, with some meaning that <i>seems</i> to be definitely implicit but not of anything you could precisely identify? <br/><br/>Chuubo can help you do that.<br/><br/>Also there's plenty of advice on how to make jam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Killy" title="Killy"><img alt="Killy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/669/nBHMHULXQGKOR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Killy">Killy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417386/#Comment_417386" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T22:36:20+00:00" title="June 27, 2013 10:36PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been <i>trying</i> to follow this game, but I cannot into Chuubo - it's just so nebulous at this point.

Eight points of Skills, which can be anything you like (catchphrases like "you've got to have teriyaki" are popular). You also have 8 points of Will per chapter, and spending Will to boost a Skill will give the Intention rating that determines how good a result your efforts will get.<br/><br/>On top of this are quests. A quest is a longer-term project that your character is working on, and will be something like "Passing Grade in Algebra [25 XP]." Once you accumulate 25 XP to that quest, you receive a small reward called a Perk (also you don't have to retake the ninth grade). Sets of Quests can be arranged into an Arc of 3-5 quests, which once complete, will earn you a long-term upgrade to your powers. Ordinary people have mundane Arcs, while people with wishing machines and the like take miraculous Arcs that provide a set of wish-fueled powers.<br/><br/>How, then, do you get XP? This is the heart of the engine. Chuubo can be operated in one of eight separate genre modes, including Pastoral, Gothic, Urban Fantasy, and Fairy Tale. Each genre has its own set of XP actions that give you the chance to earn an XP for the pot. In a Pastoral game, you'll want to do simple, honest things and share your feelings with others. In an epic game, you're going to want to test your theories and put your faith on the line. In a Techno game, you're going to want to describe a psychedelic break from reality that means <i>something,</i> even if you aren't sure what.<br/><br/>These things--these actions that foreground the emotional heart of the genre--give you XP, which fuels your progress onward.<br/><br/>There's also an Example of Play that you might find helpful!

It kind of reminds me of one of my favorite gaming-related quotes, from an old review of some Super-Bass-Fishing video game:\n<blockquote>Fishing, like decapitating zombies, is only fun in video games.</blockquote>Like, a preview released to backers today describes some of the mundane chores people in Fortitude do, such as checking for rust damage or cleaning fish. In a tabletop RPG the action is abstracted enough that I just say "I'm slicing the fish in half and scooping out the guts." And the other player goes "Yup, those are fish guts alright.

I haven't read the draft yet, but I have read most of the public updates and been following her posts in the RPG.net thread, and it looks like the game is an attempt to marry that LARPy/freeform "let's just hang out in-character for a while and see where that goes" vibe with the bildungsroman/DING-time-to-level-up-my-dude structure more common to the tabletop RPG format.  It's not ALL quotidian stuff (I mean, there are talking swashbuckler rats and fox-spirits just hanging out in town and available as PC options), but it is putting some of the realism back in magical realism.  One of the "mundane tasks" listed in that latest preview is sweeping out the particles of Un-Creation that get into all the nooks and crannies and rust the unrustable.<br/><br/>Clearly, you're gonna need the right group and right vibe for this, but Nobilis had a tendency to drift in this direction already because so few things actually pose a challenge to those cosmos-striding demiurges, so it's not totally foreign to me.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to reading more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417442/#Comment_417442" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T10:28:03+00:00" title="June 28, 2013 10:28AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2013 10:28AM by Andy.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>TOO <br/><br/>MANY <br/><br/>KICKSTARTER<br/><br/>UPDATES</b><br/><br/>(but otherwise, super-intriguing, glad I backed it!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rand_Brittain" title="Rand_Brittain"><img alt="Rand_Brittain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rand_Brittain">Rand_Brittain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417447/#Comment_417447" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T12:42:20+00:00" title="June 28, 2013 12:42PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2013 1:41PM by Rand_Brittain.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One of the sticking points for me is that it doesn't seem like it would be very <i>fun</i> to roleplay mundane stuff I can already easily do in everyday life.

Having a fish dinner at the end of the scene isn't the important part of Shared Action; what's important here is showing some other Main Character  how you live your life. What you do, who you are. If you feel like you're having trouble getting even a tiny emotional response out of watching the Prodigy clean a fish, well, it's okay to go for something more exaggerated and wind up clinging to the ceiling to get away from the terrible fish guts. And then she can laugh at you, because city boy Chuubo is afraid of a few fish eyeballs! And what do you know, you just bonded a little.<br/><br/>Note that if you're playing in a more traditional genre, the important XP beats are more traditional RPG actions. Epic fantasy involves making great declarations, engaging in acts of faith and will, and making mistakes. Helping your friends sweep the front yard while talking about your feelings is to pastoral gaming as bombastic speechifying is to epic fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417454/#Comment_417454" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T14:25:03+00:00" title="June 28, 2013  2:25PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2013 2:25PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Rand said a lot of it already. When Carly and I play games together, she gets a lot of joy out of connecting with and building relationships with NPCs. When I read the Pastoral Genre for Chuubo and saw that the actions that advance the plot forward are all about connecting to other characters, talking about what you're thinking and feeling, and just kind of enjoying life I saw it lasering in on the things she enjoys but are secondary to a lot of other games.<br/><br/>What's neat to me is how plot progresses as an intersection of genre and character arc. So, say I play a character who wants to be the best swordsman in the world. <br/><br/>In a Pastoral game, I talk to the old swordfighter who lives in town and tell him my hopes and dreams and hear his stories and regrets. I sit under a tree and watch a sunset with my sword in my lap.

And ideally, make yourself a little vulnerable to them: <br/><br/>You do something such that they could potentially screw you over. Not that it has to be a big deal, or that they're supposed to: just, you do something that extends at least that much trust.<br/><br/>Or, if it's a Slice of Life, that something happens that sticks with you. An image or mood that lingers. And ideally when you respond to that, someone else does too, or at least responds to your response.<br/><br/>You can actually do what you suggest there and hi5 and take the XP pretty quickly---but not until you've brought things around to one of those.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>And, I guess, the game also treats it as important that this could increase your Calling---the story arclet that builds towards something important that you're meant to do---or the trouble in your heart (Something to Deal With), or, depending on how things go down, if it gets goofy maybe a different Issue entirely. ^_^<br/><br/>(And arguably it treats it as important for how the XP you get fits into all the XP mechanics, and how taking your action fades you and fits into the chapter---but that's not as big a thing in terms of what fish-gutting is actually about.)<br/><br/>Now, it's still absolutely trivial to rush this, and it's absolutely trivial to ignore this; and some people will rush it and the game'll be high-octane fun, and others will rush through most such scenes but that'll give them more time to focus on the ones that suddenly spin off into something cool, and others <i>still</i> will rush through them and get nowhere and wonder where the game is. And conversely there'll also be a group that only barely need those rules at all and so mostly ignores them and has fun just from knowing that the game CALLS those scenes important.<br/><br/>But . . .<br/><br/>Well, that's the meat of the scenes in the game.<br/><br/>Best wishes,<br/><br/>Jenna                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417490/#Comment_417490" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T17:32:54+00:00" title="June 29, 2013  5:32PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, Rand said a lot of it already. When Carly and I play games together, she gets a lot of joy out of connecting with and building relationships with NPCs. When I read the Pastoral Genre for Chuubo and saw that the actions that advance the plot forward are all about connecting to other characters, talking about what you're thinking and feeling, and just kind of enjoying life I saw it lasering in on the things she enjoys but are secondary to a lot of other games.<br/><br/>What's neat to me is how plot progresses as an intersection of genre and character arc. So, say I play a character who wants to be the best swordsman in the world. <br/><br/>In a Pastoral game, I talk to the old swordfighter who lives in town and tell him my hopes and dreams and hear his stories and regrets. I sit under a tree and watch a sunset with my sword in my lap.

It kind of reminds me of one of my favorite gaming-related quotes, from an old review of some Super-Bass-Fishing video game:<br/><br/>Like, a preview released to backers today describes some of the mundane chores people in Fortitude do, such as checking for rust damage or cleaning fish. In a tabletop RPG the action is abstracted enough that I just say "I'm slicing the fish in half and scooping out the guts." And the other player goes "Yup, those are fish guts alright. I dump them into the trash." And we high-five and get XP? I think I'm missing something...</blockquote>\nThe XP actions foreground the things that are at the <i>emotional</i> heart of the genre. Having a fish dinner at the end of the scene isn't the important part of Shared Action; what's important here is showing some other Main Character  how you live your life. What you do, who you are. If you feel like you're having trouble getting even a tiny emotional response out of watching the Prodigy clean a fish, well, it's okay to go for something more exaggerated and wind up clinging to the ceiling to get away from the terrible fish guts. And then she can laugh at you, because city boy Chuubo is afraid of a few fish eyeballs! And what do you know, you just bonded a little.<br/><br/>Note that if you're playing in a more traditional genre, the important XP beats are more traditional RPG actions. Epic fantasy involves making great declarations, engaging in acts of faith and will, and making mistakes. Helping your friends sweep the front yard while talking about your feelings is to pastoral gaming as bombastic speechifying is to epic fantasy.</blockquote>\nThis sounds <i>really</i> interesting. I don't grok it yet, but it sounds like the sort of thing that'll be awesome when I finally do. I like the idea of making the game not be about the actions, but about the emotional substance behind the actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rand_Brittain" title="Rand_Brittain"><img alt="Rand_Brittain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rand_Brittain">Rand_Brittain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417854/#Comment_417854" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-06T09:13:25+00:00" title="July  6, 2013  9:13AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The stretch goal for Fortitude: By the Docks of Big Lake is now unlocked, so you can make an add-on to your pledge to get that book in print for $40/$50.

She and her collaborators Studio Shadow did the art direction and layout for <a href="http://www.narrattiva.it/giochi" rel="nofollow">a bunch of other gorgeous Italian editions of indie games translated and published by Narrattiva</a>. In fact, Narrattiva and Studio Shadow share a lot of staff; as near as I can figure both companies are mostly Cangini and Michele Gelli.

[edit]If I wasn't sleep deprived, I probably would have thought to link to <a href="http://www.narrattiva.it/chi_siamo" rel="nofollow">Narrattiva's about page</a> which straight-up says that Narrattiva is the publishing label of Studio Shadow (yay machine translation) rather than trying to illustrate this with outside sources.<br/><br/>Those Narrattiva books!

I did not really have any idea what I was getting into beyond, "It's a little bit complicated to explain, but [here are some awesome hooks to get you excited about the game]."<br/><br/>I ended up creating a character named Lydian. She is a Newbie Oracle (Otherworldly Arc), though she doesn't know that yet. She just knows that up until she found herself on a sailing ship, she was a normal teenage girl living in Sunny Dale, California. (I... uhm. Was put on the spot.) She might have had extraordinarily vivid dreams and be an insomniac, but there was nothing *crazy* about her life up until the tsunami hit and... she woke up on the ship and thought she'd slipped into one of her dreams again. Her quests are "getting to know the (new) world" and "becoming the Oracle" and her Emotion XP track is "Putting my faith in you..." - which has all provoked me into playing a character who has a great curiosity, but is grounded by others' faith in her.<br/><br/>On the ship, she's met Lord Morris the Master Detective, Willoughby the Helpful Hedge Wizard, Nix the Recently Liberated Familiar, and Angeta the Aloof Gardener. After the Master Detective quizzed them methodically on where they came from and the last thing they remember about their world before they arrived on the ship, it seems they all came from different worlds. And the first mate of the ship helpfully directed them to a hostel run by a loud old man who Lydian is almost certain may be part sheep based on how his English tends to peter out into incomprehensible noises and his wife who moves at roughly half the speed of a glacier and talks like she's falling asleep.<br/><br/>I hope you get the impression that I enjoyed myself completely. Because I did. <br/><br/>We foundered a bit here and there, mainly because of our inexperience and most (if not all) of us but the GM not having read the material. But when it clicked, it was almost audible. The first time someone spoke up with the realization that a character had earned Emotion XP, not only did I understand the mechanic itself, but (possibly because it was my character who'd triggered the reaction), I realized that I ought to be watching harder for ways that the other players could have that triggered. It almost became a game of us maneuvering the situations around for each other (rather than ourselves) so that the different characters could have a situation favorable to them take place. Including bold OOC hints in the chatroom along the lines of, "Before we close this scene, this would be an *excellent* time for you to..." <br/><br/>Since we were in "Pastoral" mode, the scenes took on something of a dreamy, relaxed quality, punctuated by laughter. And the laughter that was related to something in-character happened a bit more than I expected - and it was wonderful because it was usually because of some motivation written down on their character sheet that prompted the player to pursue something they might not have thought to do otherwise.<br/><br/>The first game kind of felt like rough storyboards for an amazing animated film. We barely scratched the surface and I'm excited for another session. And, honestly, if you feel like what you heard from anyone about this game might be interesting to you, I encourage you to go for it.

It was delightful to play. Like I said at the culmination of the session, "It's like when you start a new workout, and you're stretching all these muscles you've never really used before." So it was difficult, I won't lie about that. But even so, I could feel myself slowly beginning to "get" it.<br/><br/>Lord Morris is defined not just by his insatiable desire to chase down secrets, but also by a need to understand how things work in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>I only regret that I'm tightly trying to manage my schedule, so that I can't regularly commit to the game. Though, it really does feel like a game I could drop in and out of, probably partially because it's a Pastoral genre.<br/><br/>I don't think it's something that you'll "get" right off the bat (unless you're lucky or quite good), but it's something that you'll learn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jenna_Moran" title="Jenna_Moran"><img alt="Jenna_Moran" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jenna_Moran">Jenna_Moran</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418025/#Comment_418025" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-09T08:20:43+00:00" title="July  9, 2013  8:20AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A group of us played this Monday night (that being yesterday, of course) and it seems like it may become a regular game. <br/><br/>I knew little about the game other than skimming the Kickstarter, lurking in this thread, and very slowly working my way through the first dozen pages or so of the first rpg.net monster-thread on it.
