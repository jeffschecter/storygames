Any other roleplaying games are just toolboxes.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>That said, everybody knows what a game is but none can define it (like Wittgenstein pointed out). Many have tried but <i>it more shows what kind of games they experienced rather than a definite definition</i>. Don't believe me? Well, <a href="https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/06/29/level-1-overview-what-is-a-game/" rel="nofollow">here is Ian Schreiber</a> collecting some of the bigger names and their tries. I like Bernard Suits' attempt: \xbbA game is a \u201cvoluntary effort to overcome unnecessary obstacles.\u201d\xab<br/><br/>But this whole discussion is taken from the wrong perspective:<br/>- Is it really the definition we want?<br/>- Will it matter to me if someone thinks my roleplaying game is a game or not?<br/><br/>My definition is nowadays that if someone is saying it's a game, then it's a game. I can take a book and say it's a game. You wont possibly be entertained by it like the games you're normally used to, but my statement that it's a game will say something about my target audience.<br/><br/>That's the important subject. The definition itself about games wont give anything to any designer out there, but the way it conveys their work to their intended target audience is.<br/><br/>And the same goes with any definition about roleplaying games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451295/#Comment_451295" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-12T15:10:45+00:00" title="February 12, 2016  3:10PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, an aside. I've often thought Rickard's idea that most RPGs are toolkits to create games rather than actual games themselves was a very good point.<br/><br/>That said, I'll take a stab at one aspect of this, put out there mostly for discussion. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this next bit, but it is something I've considered several times.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Games have goals and victory conditions.</span><br/><br/>Something that has clear goals and related clear victory conditions is very easily recognized as a game. Not terribly controversial, I'd imagine.<br/><br/>In edge cases, like Microscope, goals and victory conditions are not clear and obvious. That's what makes them edge cases of falling into or out of the category "game".<br/><br/>Stealing from Greg Costikiyan's writing about The SIMs ( I'll try to find the link later), he discusses how The Sims starts as a toy, but becomes a game as players start to add their own goals (implying victory conditions).<br/><br/>Many times, with mainstream RPGs and story-games, Goals/Victory conditions are non-obvious. Likewise, many of those goals are unspoken, unrecognized, and exist at the player level. Many of them are social in nature. They are created by the participants themselves, and there may be many competing and very different goals may be sought by individual participants.<br/><br/>If this is all true ( or mostly true) it doesn't deny that those "edge cases" are games. It just means that to determine the goals, one may have to approach looking at the activities a bit like an anthropologist. What did these participants actually do? What did they say about it? What were the observable behaviors that one associates with winning or losing that the participants demonstrated?<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Possibility: In the edge cases, the goals/victory conditions are often primarily about player to player, positive, social recognition. What occurs during play is a means to that end.</span><br/><br/>Gah! Gotta run to work. I have a fair bit to say about that possibility, so I'll leave that there, and y'all can discuss it amongst yerselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451301/#Comment_451301" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-12T16:21:11+00:00" title="February 12, 2016  4:21PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like a lot of what this community considers "games" (including Microscope as a prime example) is really a shorthand for:<br/><br/>"Something fun and/or challenging we do together that doesn't serve a practical purpose."<br/><br/>The word "game" is an easy shorthand for "let's get together and do something which isn't work", although it doesn't describe it precisely.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451308/#Comment_451308" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-12T20:24:44+00:00" title="February 12, 2016  8:24PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The card game Solitaire is a game, and you do that alone.<br/><br/>Reading a Choose Your Own Adventure-style book, making choices for the central character, even without rolling dice, is playing a game.<br/><br/>But, if you will pardon the rant (I do not mean to mess with the zen), First Person Scholar's article is, frankly, scholarship disappearing up its own rear end. To treat with reverence Marcel Duchamp's declaration of Fountain as art is to abdicate any meaningful standards as to what you hold to be art. Indeed First Person Scholar's article says as much, in other words, by saying that anything can be art if it is so declared (thus, there are no criteria for what can be art, other than that someone so declares it).<br/><br/>Let me try to bring that debate back to earth, with a voice that will be lost among the noise of the "art" world like the head of a pin in a mountain of haystacks; indeed, an Andean range of mountains of haystacks.<br/><br/>Standing upon my autonomy as a sentient creature and a human being, I deny Marcel Duchamp the authority to declare Fountain to be art <i>for me</i>. I allow him authority to declare it to be art <i>for him</i>, on the footing that that is a declaration of a <i>subjective</i> interpretation of reality. Fountain may be art <i>subjectively</i> to Marcel Duchamp, but that subjective characterisation has no authority over my world or my interpretation of the world, nor over the interpretation of the world of anyone else who like me <i>could</i> equally deny Duchamp the preposterous, pretentious, pompous claim to authority to declare a urinal to be art (whether or not they choose to deny the same). Thus, Marcel Duchamp's claim that Fountain is art, insofar as it can be accepted at all, can be accepted only as a statement of pure subjectivity, without any credible claim to objectivity.<br/><br/>Thus, if you claim the authority to declare anything art, or equally a game, then the implication is that your declaration is limited to a purely subjective assertion, of your personal take on things, with no necessary meaningfulness for anyone else.<br/><br/>To declare that anything can be art, or that anything can be a game, is to render your further statements on whether something is art, or a game, objectively meaningless, and to rob them of any broader credibility. It is an intellectual suicide-pill.<br/><br/>By "objective", I do not mean "logically absolutely necessary" or "inherent in the fabric of the universe" or "gifted by God". What I mean is that there have to be at least approximately definable criteria for the assignment to the label to the thing, so that the concept can be useful beyond declaring one's private, subjective views, preferences, imaginings or delusions.<br/><br/>Duchamp can tell me that a urinal is art and I can tell him that he and the entire section of the art community that would ridicule me for that assertion are deluded. There is no compelling argument that they are right and I am wrong. What Fountain is, to me, is not art, but the embodiment of a statement, a crass, misconceived statement that has attracted unwarranted publicity, and that if it has succeeded in making me think, has primarily made me think about how crass and tasteless it is, and/or whether it is just a joke at the art community's expense (which seems equally credible).<br/><br/>A more meaningful concept of a game is probably broad enough to encompass most if not all forms of structured play. (A freeform roleplaying game with stable character-identification or set standards as to character-switching is a form of structured play.)<br/><br/>The word "game" is useful to describe storygames and roleplaying games partly because no other word adequately describes their structured play element.<br/><br/>If you can identify something as structured play then I think you would need some cogent reason for removing it from the category of "game".<br/><br/>I have never played Microscope, and it does not sound very much like my cup of tea, but it certainly sounds like a game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451309/#Comment_451309" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-12T20:28:27+00:00" title="February 12, 2016  8:28PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * assignment of the label to the thing, I meant<br/><br/>* and I meant, Duchamp can tell me that a urinal is art, and I can tell him that he is deluded, and I can say the same to the entire section of the art world who would ridicule me for calling Duchamp deluded for that                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451321/#Comment_451321" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-13T22:27:46+00:00" title="February 13, 2016 10:27PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2016 2:15AM by AsIf.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gonna posit that "Fountain" was a game Duchamp played using the rules of art.<br/><br/>The object of the game (the unnecessary obstacle, voluntarily engaged) was to hit all the reductionist structural parameters of a piece of art, while remaining objectively and obviously outside of those parameters.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
