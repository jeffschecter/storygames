And yet the group that most intrigues me is the Steamwheede Cartel, the mercantile goblins who are sitting in the midst of this epic, world-spanning confrontation and making a giant fucking profit off the entire thing.  In this world of ceaseless conflict between races, the only group that can get a coalition of all races working together is the goblins.  They employ humans, orcs, gnolls, ogres, and whoever else applies for a job, apparently.  In Warcraft III, the orcs and humans travel to far-off and unheard of Kalimdor-- and find their old friends the goblins waiting for them, ready to sell.  How are these guys not the protagonists of their world?!?<br/><br/>But alas, you cannot play goblins or operatives of the Steamwheedle Cartel in WoW.  So my only option is to make a tabletop hack.  So what would Profitcraft: Steamwheedle Ascendant look like?  How can you focus game play on playing the two "big" powers off of each other?  How do you incentivize profit over power?  How do you incite conflict and profit from it without getting drawn into it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102014/#Comment_102014" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T12:47:50+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 12:47PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oddly enough, I think this is the first time Fastlane (that roulette wheel game) has leaped to mind.<br/>Trollbabe's mechanics would work well too.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102081/#Comment_102081" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T15:18:38+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  3:18PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For all the bookkeeping and accountancy that D&amp;D promotes, there's actually very little support there for actually running a business, as I discovered when I started working on a crime syndicate campaign...<br/><br/>However, there's tons of "business simulation" games out there cheap or free - not that I am knowledgeable enough about them to recommend one, but that's where I would start.  Hell, there's probably some in business 101 textbooks that could form the seed for a game about this.<br/><br/>I agree that the goblins are heroes.The only question is if they're just regular old heroes or the greatest heroes the world has ever known. I lean towards the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
