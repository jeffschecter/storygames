It\u2019s as simple as that.<br/><br/>That\u2019s what <i>Showdown </i>is all about. One-on-one narrative combat between you and another player. Your arena is your imagination. Your weapons are your character, your dice and your words.  And, in the end, one of you will emerge victorious, while the other is crushed in defeat.<br/><br/>It\u2019s too late to ask if you\u2019re ready. You are already standing in the arena. So, prepare yourself, because it\u2019s time to fight!<br/><br/><b>A Call to Playtest</b><br/><br/>Interested in taking <i>Showdown</i> out for a spin? It's a two-player RPG that will take you about 90 minutes to play, from setup to cleanup.

This really is one of the coolest pick-up-and-play games I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It's one on one, which is cool by itself as there aren't many 2 player RPGs out there.<br/>It's zero prep and the total game takes...well, if it goes over 2 hours I'd be surprised.<br/><br/>It's a tactical challenge in the same way as Liars Dice is a tactical challenge...or the classic "are you the sort of person to put the poison in your own glass..." decisions.  <br/><br/>The game is, in its entirety, concerned with getting inside the other player's head and messing with them.  Pushing their buttons and making them really REALLY hate what you're doing to their character.<br/><br/>The game ends with someone's death.  If you treat "not dying" as a win condition and really push to not die...you will wind up with a character you barely recognize...and if your "opponent" is doing their job right, you are actually revolted by...in the "oh my god, THIS is what I've become?" sort of way.  Your opponent's job is to take everything they know about you and what kind of characters you think are cool and destroy that utterly.<br/><br/>The key trade off then, is if you fight for your character's identity...you'll probably be the one who winds up dead.<br/><br/>The obvious tactical play then is to try and maneuver such that you can preserve your character as you envision them AND survive.  Of course, gunning for a suitably dramatic death without looking like a punk is also an option.<br/><br/>In the end what you'll have done is told a story (in flash back) of the entire history of these two people from the first moment they realized they hate each other, while simultaneously telling the blow by blow drama of their final confrontation.<br/><br/>It is teh Sweet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186090/#Comment_186090" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T14:57:56+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  2:57PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br/><br/>Wow!

So, with that in mind....<br/><br/>There's a bit of a tactical challenge. Each player has access to five pairs of dice: 2d4, 2d6, 2d8, 2d10, and 2d12. During each round, you secretly select one to use and then reveal it. The key is that you're rolling the two dice for two different categories, one of which likes high numbers and the other likes low numbers. Also, your dice are your hit points; run out and you lose. Plus, there are some one-shot abilities that you can use to fiddle with the results. So, there's that. It's no Burning Wheel scripting, but I'd like to think that there are <i>some</i> interesting tactical decisions.<br/><br/>Additionally, there are the Qualities of the characters that act as narration constraints. During the game, your opponent gets to change them through using Flashbacks. So, over time, your character gets changed by your opponent.<br/><br/>Finally, I'll note that there's a significant social-level component necessary to high-level play of <i>Showdown</i>. It is really best played with someone that you know.<br/><br/>Whisper me if you're interested in having a look.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186096/#Comment_186096" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T15:01:57+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  3:01PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

And, come to think of it, the game <i>was</i> partly inspired by a game that Emily Care Boss and I were playing on Knife Fight.<br/><br/>Hmm. That could be an interesting experiment, actually. So, yeah, does someone want to playtest <i>Showdown</i> with me right here on Story Games? (Unless a mod objects, of course.)
