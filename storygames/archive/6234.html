Many thanks to Arthur, Jake, Joel, John, Lesley, Lukas, Nick, Ogre, Skull and Willem!<br/><br/>The first hour each night was taken up with making or choosing characters and explaining the rules.  We played for the scheduled three hours the first night, one character scene and one big conflict against three opponents.  On Saturday, the players asked to keep on playing for another hour, and we managed to do two conflicts and three character scenes. The conflict mechanics were really what I wanted to test out, and I got a lot out of this.<br/><br/><b>The Good</b><br/><br/>I really liked that in both games, the players were tossing action dice back and forth to help each other in maneuvers. It's like fanmail on crack.  I'm hoping that it's not building up too much of an expectation that then disappoints the players when they don't get any, but I don't think that can be avoided.<br/><br/>I'm also glad to see the players engage with each other during character scenes, and to a lesser degree during conflicts. Even with little prep time, there were some neat interactions and dynamics that sprang up. <br/><br/>Making up goals in the middle of conflicts works like a charm. Giving the players the ability to suggest a goal to lower the enemy's stats makes for really neat twists and turns in the conflicts, and I don't have to worry so much about what I throw at them.<br/><br/><b>The Bad</b><br/><br/>First, the obvious: players weren't familiar enough with the system to really make use of it.  Some powers went unused.  Options were not explored.  But that's to be expected.<br/><br/>It turns out that Poison was way too deadly.  Lukas' monk destroyed the Elite Imperial Lieutenant in her power armor simply by Poisoning her and watching her spit blood and become incapacitated.  That's because she had no action dice left, and any turn that she spent recovering was negated by the Poisoned effect.  So here are the related changes: Poisoned remains the same, but passing now recovers 2 action dice.  That works better overall, so people don't have to pass as often.  Also, Refresh now replenishes 4 action dice instead of 3.<br/><br/>Some of the powers didn't feel strong enough, so I've added a bonus die to some of them (mostly the elemental-based strike powers). More tweaks of that sort are likely to follow.<br/><br/>Finally, I made at least one boo-boo as a GM. Jake brought up a piece of technology that his gadget character had scavenged in the previous character scene. I gave him more maneuver dice for reincorporation.  Then Skull pulled out the piece, too, and I realized in that moment that Jake had actually given the thing to Skull's character in the character scene.  In that moment of confusion, I failed to properly reward Skull's maneuver.  Keeping track of these kinds of things is going to be important in a game where the players get to make up and use their own details within the story.<br/><br/><b>And Also</b><br/><br/>Arthur's character was very slapsticky, and there were some slapstick moments with other characters as well.  This worked fine within the game, both because maneuvers can really be anything, and because there are plenty of anime examples with slapstick characters in the mix.  Also, the other players seemed to be entertained by the comedic antics.  In a non-con game, the mood determination would happen beforehand and make sure players are on board with this.<br/><br/>I'm open for more thoughts and suggestions!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138337/#Comment_138337" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T14:05:33+00:00" title="April  5, 2008  2:05PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really enjoyed the game and I think the design was overall really excellent. I'm interested to know how your fixes turn out. In particular I think the fix you propose for poison (passing gets two dice) will make the game more dynamic overall. <br/><br/>Arthur's character was hilarious, I do hope he joins the board like he said.

I think increasing the benefits of passing/refresh will have a net positive benefit to the game beyond just fixing Poison.  I deliberately made my character to make use of powers that removed dice from other characters, rather than doing a ton of damage.  Towards the end, I got to work that some, but I underestimated how long it would take me to build up the Charge dice I needed.<br/><br/>Also, I really like the token rule, where you can save up Strikes if you get a really good success.  I'm going to reiterate my statement at the con that I think they should be usable for activating Action Powers as well (but definitely not extra Maneuvers).<br/><br/>Thanks for the great game, Christian.  I'll be playing this again with friends soon, so hopefully we'll be able to give more feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138490/#Comment_138490" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T06:44:24+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  6:44AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, for those who weren't there, this wasn't in the alpha version.  But instead of taking a free strike when you gain 5 dice in a maneuver, you get an Awersome Token.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention that, but I took your advice there as well, Lukas. Awesome Tokens can now be used for an extra strike, achievement, or action power.  Also, two of them can be used to apply your strike against two opponents at once (roll all dice, including charge powers and weapon effects and such, and apply the result against each opponent's defense).  And if you've got one left at the end of the conflict, you can keep all of your charge dice or fill up your Action Pool with it.<br/><br/>You can also benefit another player with a token, if you want.<br/><br/>Thanks guys <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139484/#Comment_139484" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T07:10:35+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  7:10AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and thanks to y'all's feedback, I've put Combined Achievements for goals into the rules, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139486/#Comment_139486" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T07:42:25+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  7:42AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the rules are updated, then re-URL us, my good man! <br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139494/#Comment_139494" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T09:30:46+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  9:30AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in the middle of writing out the whole beta version.

Interestingly enough the heart of it's goodness is also where it diverges from the Final Fantasy influence: the Beast Hunters carryover of Maneuvers to build up for a Strike. I loved it in BH and I love it even more in the punchier, less-bookkeeping AP version.<br/><br/>One aspect of the game that I'd like to dig deeper into is the whole story context outside of battles. It's all in the game text, from the Story/Setting Seeds right down to the interlude scenes to charge up traits. But in the context of a beat-em-up one shot we didn't get much chance to test drive the story side of things. A more long-term playtest would obviously be in order.<br/><br/>I actually think I like Maneuvers carrying over immediately into a Strike better than the Token to save for later. It makes for a better flow to the action, and makes sense to me as a nice fluid unit of Asskickery. Hmm, am I a Beast Hunters Grognard. . .? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Also, it seems like the selection of powers could use a bit of expanding. There wasn't a lot of range to make just the powers *I* wanted for my specific character. Like, I put Haste on my sword instead of making it an innate power, basically because I wanted to be a guy with hyperspeed/berzerker frenzy power, and the regular Haste ability was a "spell" essentially that you could case on anybody. Maybe differentiate between abilities that can target anyone, and the same abilit as 'self only" with a lower cost?<br/><br/>Anyway, lots of fun and thank you!<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
