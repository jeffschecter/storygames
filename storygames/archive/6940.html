We only got to play out a single scene unfortunately, because we were oh so leisurely in our prep work.<br/><br/>But it was rad awesome, and one of the funnest character duos I've been a part of.<br/><br/>We decided that we'd play Mortal Coil, and after much deliberation decided we should play a game about anthropomorphic animals. My primary point of reference was Redwall, but both Daniel and Chad disliked Redwall without ever having read it. So I was worried, off the bat, that we'd get into a rut of arguing about some of the core conceits of these animal people and how they worked. We gladly emerged triumphant.<br/><br/>We wanted animals who were at war.<br/><br/>We decided that the forest was divided into kingdoms, each a composite of many different animal races. Ours was the Rabbit Court, and our leaders were brash and twitchy, but noble at heart. Chad created a mouse. Mice were oppressed creatures in this kingdom, but the Rabbit Court treated them with much more respect than our foes, the Ursa Kingdom.<br/><br/>Chad's mouse, Wick, had the ability to sniff magic. He was a cunning scout, and was hoping to be an inspirational leader to his people, standing up for mice rights everywhere.<br/><br/>My character was a badger named Debin Stodge. He was a tactician/siege engineer - once a highly revered military icon, now beginning to slip in his old age. He was struggling between the genius he once was and the old senile man he would soon become. He was a geomancer, which turned out to be pretty cool - the way geomancy works, it's all focused on exploiting natural weaknesses in the landscape. This might mean triggering landslides or pushing rivers over their natural banks. The price was that the land would become unstable and vengeful around the geomancer for a period afterward. Debin's outlook was, "This ain't a good week to be Debin Stodge. It just ain't."<br/><br/>I played the character's one scene with a lot of bravado, but also incompetence. If anyone here has seen Boston Legal, he was the badger geomancer tactician version of William Shatner's brilliant Denny Crane. There was a lot of, "This is a dangerous, deadly plan... a Debin Stodge kind of plan!"<br/><br/>I introduced the Ursa Kingdom through one of my Passions (I will topple the Ursa Kingdom court). Daniel stepped in and brought everything together perfectly when he filled in the details: The Ursa Kingdom was ruled by four monarchs. They had perfected the rituals of long hibernation, which let them sleep fifteen or more years, agelessly, at a time. The rituals required massive resources... so every five years the ruling Bear King would demand a massive tax upon the harvests, leaving the kingdom short of resources, and fall into a fifteen year slumber. Soon enough, the next Bear King (or Queen) would wake up and rule his domain for a five year period.<br/><br/>The current king was Grunwald, the Winter King. He was the most warmongering of all the Bear Kings, and used his might to bully smaller and less powerful nations. It was at this point that the Rabbit Court challenged Grunwald, and sent troops on to the march. At the head of that was a scouting vanguard, led by Debin Stodge, and his loyal courier, Wick.<br/><br/><br/>Most awesome. I am hopeful for the chance to play these characters and this game again. One short scene was simply not enough.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154995/#Comment_154995" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T13:59:18+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  1:59PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks for sharing! sounds like you've got an all star lineup,<br/>i'm berry excited for more anthropomorphic storytime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155012/#Comment_155012" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T15:19:44+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  3:19PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jackson. I was hoping Daniel and Chad might pop in here to share their perspectives.<br/><br/>I am really exciting about the possibility of continuing this game. I hope it's possible, considering:<br/>1.) That wasn't our entire gaming group, so it's a special case to organize<br/>2.) I'm starting a 3 week intensive course on Tuesday, and will be out of the run for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
