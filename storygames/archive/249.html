<p>I want a fortune-less conflict resolution engine that works with all the stakes setting techniques that are used with fortune-full play. Basically, one that shares an important key feature with normal dice based conflict resolution systems like Duel of Wits and Bringing Down the Pain: when the ruckus starts, you may be able to tell who has the advantage, but you can't be sure about who will win.</p>
<p>Here's the ideas that I have so far. It's, uh, not <em>actually</em> completely diceless, but the dice don't come in until the conflict's over.</p>
<h3>Traits and Tools</h3>
<p>Traits and Tools are what characters use to gain an advantage in a conflict. A trait is a brief, evocative phrase that describes an area that the character is strong in, rated with 1 to 3 points of Strength. Traits also have a refresh condition. When that condition is met, all spent Strength returns. Starting PCs would have four (?) Traits, so a character might look like this:</p>
<p>Sam the Sorcerer<br/>
* Deceitful Magic (2): spend time studying his spell books<br/>
* Forked Tongue (1): be shown disrespect<br/>
* Walker in Shadows (1): prevent another from gaining the Emperor's favor<br/>
* Apothecary (1): by his malign advice, increase another's suffering</p>
<p>Tools weapons, spells, authority, and other such things that characters can use to their advantage. Same the Sorcerer's weapons might include his illusions and enchantments, the political clout that comes from being the Emperor's advisor, and his poisoned dagger.</p>
<h3>Conflict Structure</h3>
<p>When a conflict is initiated (that is, two characters are each working to achieve something that the other does not want to happen), the first thing that must be done is the setting of stakes. Spell them out explicitly, and make sure they're weighty and cool and everyone buys into them.</p>
<p>After stakes are set, starting with the initiator of the conflict, players take turns making moves. On their move, a player tries to gain points of <em>advantage</em> (represented by white stones). If, by the end of their move, they have failed to gain any advantage, or have less advantage than the opposition, they must give in. The other guy wins the stakes.</p>
<p>The intensity of the conflict is tracked by <em>conflict level</em>, which starts at 1 (contest), and can escalate up to 2 (fight) and then 3 (mortal). During a contest, characters are maneuvering for advantage, trying to convince the other guy of their position, sneaking past each other, and so forth, but not hurting eachother. In a fight, someone's going to get wounded. In a mortal conflict, there's a chance that someone will die. At any time during their turn, a player may escalate the conflict level.</p>
<p>Stakes may be renegotiated at any time between turns. In addition, at any time between turns, players may agree that both characters achieve what they want, or that neither character gets what they want. Even if the conflict ends in a draw in this manner, fallout (see below) will still occur.</p>
<h3>Making Moves</h3>
<p>On their move, a player narrates their character's action and attempts to gain points of advantage. Narration, in addition to providing color, can help a character to bring traits and tools into play, and to increase their <em>move limit</em> for the turn. Move limit starts at 1. By making clever or tactical use of some element of the environment or situation, it may be increased by one. By <em>exerting</em> a trait, it may be increased by one more. You can only exert one trait per move. An exerted trait cannot be used until it is refreshed.</p>
<p>Advantage can be gained in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Struggle:</strong> Take points of struggle (represented by the black stones) not exceeding your move limit. Gain advantage equal to struggle taken x the current conflict level. If, at the start of your move, your struggle exceeds 3x the current conflict level, you must either escalate to the next level or give in. If you are already in a mortal conflict, you must give in.</p>
<p><strong>Traits:</strong> Spend points of strength from relevant traits not exceeding your move limit. Gain advantage equal to the number of points spent x the current conflict level.</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> Take any number of points of risk (represented by the red stones), Gain two advantage per point (during a fight) or four advantage per point (during a mortal conflict). You cannot take risk during a contest.</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> If you have a relevant tool, gain 1 extra point of advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Help:</strong> If you have competent assistants, gain 1 extra point of advantage. In addition, each assistant can take points of risk and spend strength from their traits as an individual. However, the total amount of strength spent per move, struggle, and advantage, are all determined by side, not by character. Characters are free to switch sides at any time between moves.</p>
<h3>Fallout</h3>
<p>At the end of a conflict that has reached level 2 or 3, everyone with points of risk rolls 1d6 per point and adds it all up. Everyone on the losing side rolls an extra d6, and also adds in the side's struggle as of the end of the conflict.</p>
<p>If the conflict was a fight, everyone takes <em>light harm</em> equal to a fifth of their total, rounding up. During a fight or a mortal conflict, a character with light harm gains one fewer points of advantage per move. After each move, they recover one point of light harm.</p>
<p>If the conflict was mortal, everyone takes <em>severe harm</em> equal to a fifth of their total, rounding up, max of three. If a character has 3 or more points of severe harm, then the amount of advantage that they gain with each move is decreased by one. If they only have 2 sever harm, the reduction applies during fight and mortal conflicts. With 1 point, it is only applicable to mortal conflicts.</p>
<p>When a character rolls higher than 15 for mortal fallout, they take a <em>scar</em>, or some sort of obvious physical or mental disfigurement to serve as a reminder. If they roll higher than 20, that's the end of the line. Death.</p>
<p>After a conflict, characters that were penalized by severe harm recover points of severe harm equal to the conflict level. Recovered harm can then be spent to buy, change, and advance traits. Buying a trait with 0 strength costs one point, as does changing an existing trait's description or refresh condition. Advancing a trait by 1 strength costs points equal to the trait's new strength rating. All trait gains and alterations have to be relevant to the conflict in some way.</p>
<hr/>
<p>That's the idea, anyway. I might even expand it into a full game some day, but for now it's sort of a 'practice design.' I've never read Dogs in the Vinyard, but, from what I know of it, this share's a few aspects with it's system: the different conflict levels and gaining traits as fallout from conflicts.</p>
<p>Here's the problem with it, though: it only models character vs. character conflict. Doesn't let you do any man vs. nature stuff. I guess that's livable, but it kinda bugs me. Is there any way to deal with that, without writing a whole new system for it?</p>
<p>Or, hell, is there any good way to handle fortune-less character against nature conflicts, and still be able to set stakes meaningfully?</p>

                            Hey, Jeph.  This looks neat.<br/>
<br/>
Couple questions:<br/>
<br/>
Fallout is only every physical harm?<br/>
<br/>
Instead of dividing the dice by five to get your damage, what do you think about multiplying hit points by five to begin with?  Less math in the middle of things.<br/>
<br/>
Who judges what counts as Risk or the availability of helpers?                        </div>

<p>Huh, yeah, it wouldn't be hard to treat natural obstacles <em>exactly</em> like characters.  I could even play that up so that jail cells, rocky caves, and whatever could grant assistance bonuses at times.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Kinda</em>. It's mostly physical stuff, but a wee bit fuzzy at the edges and ambiguous. 'Cuz, you know, 3 points of severe harm will work against you when you're just arguing, and you can use it to buy traits like "Horse Whisperer" or whatever.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">

</div></blockquote>
<p>That'd actually increase the math in the middle of things. As it is, you're just dividing stuff directly AFTER things have happened. When stuff has <em>stopped</em> happening, because the conflict's over. If you just took the total roll as Harm, and lost 5 points of harm after each turn, that'd be more fiddly stuff while the conflict is going on.</p>
<p>If what I think you're saying is the same thing as what you're actually saying, at any rate.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Who judges what counts as Risk or the availability of helpers?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Taking risk isn't based on narration: you just say, "I take <em>n</em> risk." A character's player (or the GM for NPCs) decides whether or not that character is acting as a helper, though the GM can disqualify them if there's no narration in there to support it.</p>
<p>More thoughts on assistants:</p>
<p>Helpers can join the conflict on any side, or switch sides, at any point between moves. They may also drop out of the conflict at any point during the move. If they choose to drop out, they immediately take harm as though they had lost the conflict. The original character representing each side of the conflict cannot switch sides, and if they choose to drop out, the entire side gives in. They also have the authority to disallow someone from throwing in on their side.</p>
