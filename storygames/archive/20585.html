It\u2019s on Kickstarter now. It is about otters, and also Turkey and Africa.<br/><br/>Ironclaw is a tabletop role-playing game about a fantasy version of Renaissance-era Europe and China populated by anthropomorphic animals \xe0 la Disney\u2019s <i>Robin Hood</i> or <i>Zootopia.</i> This project, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sanguine/ironclaw-the-book-of-horn-and-ivory" rel="nofollow">Ironclaw: the Book of Horn &amp; Ivory</a>, introduces a new continent inspired by Africa and the Near East, and especially by Turkish expansion in the 16th and 17th centuries. You can look forward to janissaries, galley warfare, Islamic science and medicine, and Barbary pirates; and boss characters inspired by Sayyida al-Hurra and Dracula. I am proud to add to the depressingly short list of fantasy depictions of these regions.<br/><br/>Also, when I started writing this book, I had this conversation with the editor.<br/>Me: So a lot of this book is gonna focus on the Barbary pirates allied with the Turkish caliph.<br/>Editor: That sounds pretty cool. They could be the Otter Lords of the Sea or something.<br/>Me: Otter Lords, or \u2026 Otter Mans?<br/>Editor: \u2026 you are not allowed to make that pun in the book.<br/>Me: Here is a map of the distribution of the Eurasian otter. Right in the middle of it is Turkey.<br/>Editor: I talked to the publisher. He also says you\u2019re not allowed to make that pun in the book.<br/>Me: Fine. But the caliph will just happen to be an otter. Also all the Turkish nobility. They will be literal otter mans.<br/>Editor: That\u2019s fine. You just can\u2019t say it.\ufeff<br/><br/><b>Things you might like about this book</b><br/>\u2022 While I was researching this book, I couldn't find any RPG depictions of this place and time. This game is set in a fantasy world, but the signposts pointing to the Ottoman Empire, post-Mameluke Egypt, Islamic religion and thought, Barbary piracy, and the \xd2\u0323y\xf3\u0323 Empire are pretty clear.<br/>\u2022 The character creation system is detailed and intuitive enough that it's easy to express your vision of your character.<br/>\u2022 You can be a badger who is a janissary.<br/>\u2022 You can be a spider who rides a velociraptor.<br/>\u2022 It's premised on a pun about otters.<br/>\u2022 Cool pictures.<br/><br/><b>Things you might not like about this book</b><br/>\u2022 It's Ironclaw. It's a pretty traditional game: task resolution, mechanics focused on world simulation, detailed combat with a map, weapon list with lots of polearms.<br/>\u2022 The GM role is strong but not too structured.<br/><br/>This game and this book are very, very different from the kind of thing I usually play or write, structurally, so I'm (perhaps morbidly) curious about Story Games's reaction to it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
