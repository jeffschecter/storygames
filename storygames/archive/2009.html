                    My first though with Sanctum: The Fallout was simple.   A PDF version and a 4x6 paperback book.<br/>I've seen and heard some interesting discussion about different sizes, prices and attraction, and it just leaves me wondering if there is some secret I don't know about when it comes to book size, shape and 'better'.<br/><br/>Does size really matter?   Will a buyer still purchase a nicely printed 4x6 paperback over a 6x9 paperback?<br/>If the quality is the same, and the print quality and art is unchanged, what impact does size really have?<br/>Would one or the other actually prevent you from buying a game you were interested in?<br/><br/>On one hand, I thought 6x9 would be nice, especially if I wished to at some point, do a boxed set to include dice, cards and some character sheets with the book, as well as a reference of different free gaming systems.    Am I limiting myself by wanting my book in a 4x6 instead of a 6x9?<br/><br/>...so, consider this a conversation strictly about different book sizes...how much DOES it matter?<br/><br/>and DOES it matter?                </div>

                            There's no real data, but I haven't seen anything to suggest it really matters, as long as the product is well made (for instance, that your layout/typography is appropriate to the scale). Big publishers tend to do largish books but who knows if that's a great idea...it's just how it's been done. The novelty of a small book may make it stand out.                        </div>

                            My games have thusfar been modestly endowed.  Both have been digest sized (8.5" by 5.5") and I really like that form factor as a gamer.  It feels good in the hand and is easy to access.  Grey Ranks will be 6" by 9".  <br/><br/>I'm intrigued by the idea of trade paperback format, but I worry that you won't be able to put enough information on a page to make it easy to reference, and that repeated referencing will cause it to degrade in use.  Fighting Fantasy fans want to weigh in on this?  I'm all about exploring alternative formats, though, and have all sorts of weird ideas based on printing formats like sumo-sized postcards, mini-comics, map printing and broadsheets.<br/><br/>If you plan to sell through distro channels it's worth thinking harder about using conventional sizes.                        </div>

                            My game Primitive is 4x6. I selected this size because i knew i wanted to make the books by hand in a very particuluar fold/sew/slice way. There is a lot to think about.<br/><br/>why do you want it to be small, does its diminutive stature have anything to do with the content or flavor?<br/><br/>4x6 doesn't hold a lot of type on the page, so unless the game is quite short its going to get thick. If you are perfect binding it, it simply won't stay open on a table or even in your hand, and that can be a pain when your referencing numbers, charts, rules, etc. Also, a book that small doesn't have a lot of room for a gutter or margins. I sacrificed these with primitive and threw type right into the gutter (because i used other type tricks to break up spreads, and because the way the book was stiched i didn't lose anything in the fold space). I sometimes regret that decision. Gutter space is important, good margins are important. and don't go smaller then 9.5 point type in a book this size or it will feel like your just holding a miniturized version of a "real" book.<br/><br/>In a big wall of books a little guy has just as much chance of getting lost as it does of standing out. The cover really needs to set it apart if its going to jump out at you. <br/><br/>People associate small with not-worth-it. they will want the game to be cheeper, and the game will have to offer immediate signs that it's production value are up to snuff.<br/><br/>full color will help.<br/><br/>Good news is the books are easy to store, move, take on planes. Bad news is the books get lost on a bookshelf. You can't just stick it in with paperbacks or other games, it slides back and you can't see it, or worse, it gets damaged.<br/><br/>From one small-booker to another. I hope this helps.                        </div>

                            As a side note, Kevin's "made with care in my tiny sweatshop" approach is both beautiful and punk rock.  So there's that angle to consider.  If Primitive were a slicker product I probably wouldn't have bought it.                        </div>

                            I really enjoyed Mr. Kenrick's Dead of Night format, where it could fit easily into a pocket.  It was one of the primary factors in my purchase.  This size would be especially good if you are making Sanctum to be primarially LARP-- portable and easily concealed=good for LARPage.<br/><br/>Full sized books (WotC style) have been the standard for a very long time.  WotC's 8x11 tomes tend to be unweildy, as I am trying to get my gamer-stuff out of the car while entertaining my almost-5 daughter, and they take a lot of space on the table (especially because everyone needs to bring half a dozen books to have all of their rules.  Damn WotC.)<br/><br/>If you're publishing as a PDF, 8.5"x11" and 5.5"x8.5" are good sizes, only because they work on standard printers/standard printer paper.                        </div>

                            the 6x9 softcover that is the near default for indie games has a nice look and tactile feel to it but it does not work well as a rule-book since it is hard to hold open and flip through, does not lie flat etc. <br/><br/>I encourage lots of experimentation with different formats                        </div>

<p>Smaller means more turning pages.</p>
<p>In my book, this is not so good, really. I have <em>House of Horiku</em> in what appears to be stereotype indie 6x9 format; it's saddle stitched and very thin. If it were any smaller, the diagrams and things would be cramped and illegible, and the book would be an odd thickness.</p>

                            Just to note, I would say 6x9 is far from the default among indie games.  Most of the more well known games (Dogs, PTA, Polaris and such) are actually 8.5 x 5.5,  which is to say, half the size of a piece of paper.  It's a classic size, since it's the easiest choice for doing saddle stitching or staple binding (as for <i>Horiku</i>) since it's the size of a folded pamphlet..  It may not seem like a huge difference, but(to my mind) 6x9 definately feels bigger than the numbers might imply.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Thanks everyone, this has been really helpful.<br/><br/>The current cover is designed as 4x6, but I can easily alter it for a 6x9.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fallenedge.net/images/sanctumcover2.jpg" rel="nofollow">This is the current design</a><br/><br/>My main concern is that it be easy to read, nice to look at and most importantly, practical.<br/><br/>The very core of Sanctum itself is only 2-4 pages long, but the book itself does more than just give the core idea, it explains how to put it into use, adapt it to various systems and give play by play examples, demonstrations and possible scenerios to help concrete the ideas of Sanctum into something that makes sense.  I want someone to be able to read it one time and be able to understand it, instead of having to go back and re-read things over and over again and puzzle them out.<br/><br/>I thought maybe a 4x6 would be good for that. Just plain, simple and booklike.    Now I'll have to try them both ways; maybe get a poll on it when the thing is done with some samples?   PDF is absolutely going to be the basic 8x11.<br/><br/>Thanks again for all the imput, the details, big or small are really important to me, and it's hard to find certain things like this!                        </div>

                            As Jasper said, there's no data about which is "better" <i>in general</i>, though certain formats certainly work better for different purposes. And as others have implied, the layout and general design of the book is probably more important than the physical size.                        </div>

                            Does Sanctum have alot of graphics or charts, or even alot of headings? If so, a smaller size may not work as good. If it's mostly straight text, a smaller size will probably work fine.                        </div>

                            Sanctum itself has no charts, and not alot of pictures, or at least, I had no intention of having them other than a few pieces of concept art.<br/><br/>But, I was thinking of explaining a few systems and it makes me wonder if It would make more sense to have them.  On the other hand, I like thinking that the book will be straight forward and simple; without gimmick, and following the KISS policy.    I don't know what size I'll go with yet, I suppose it depends on the final draft and if anything would look bad in the smaller size.<br/><br/>8.5 x 5.5 - I DO really like this size, I was just wondering at first if that were too big.  I'd be more inclined to prefer the size of 8.5 over a 6x9 myself.  I never did like the size of the larger whitewolf and DnD books; they were a pain to carry around, even if they did look really neat.                        </div>

                            Just to weigh in with my own experiences as a consumer. This is just what I like to buy, own and hold in my hands for easy reference and reading.<br/><br/>Basically, it's down to word count.<br/><br/>The format Jason used for Roach and Drowning and Falling (21.5cm by 14 cm or 8Â½" by 5Â½") is the format I want to see all book below a certain word count printed in.  This is also the format (IIRC) for The Mountain Witch, Dogs in the Vineyard, InSpectres, Primetime Adventures and a great many more in my collection.  I love this size, it's just right to hold and to read easily, is transportable and there's enough information on each page.<br/><br/>Above a certain word count, I want to see the page size shift to the format used for Sorceror, Dictionary of Mu and Legends of Alyria.  That is, US comic size (25.5cm by 16.5cm or 10" by 6Â½").  If a book is this size though, latout and artwork is much more important.  The minimalist design used in PTA looks great in 21.5 x 14, but a similar design looks cheap and crappy in the Sorcerer books (IMO etc etc).  Look at Dictionary of Mu for example, that design is wonderful but I can't see that layout working at all well in a 21.5 x 14 book.<br/><br/>23cm by 15cm or 9" by 6" is a kinda middling size.  Generally, I'd prefer games to be 21.5 x 14 and perhaps have a slightly more efficient layout.  The only book I own which I don't feel that way about is Spirit of the Century, which seems to work quite well at that format but weighs in at over 400 pages and would have to be even bigger if it was a smaller page size and has a layout that suits a smaller size.<br/><br/>Other sizes annoy me, some more than others.  Covenant and Shock: are square 19cm by 19cm or 7Â½" by 7Â½".  I would like both books better if they were 21.5 x 14.  Covenant has a hell of a lot of white space and I have several issues with the layout of Shock that I won't go into here, but I'd have liked to see that as a 21.5 x 14 book instead.  Any book that's landscape annoys me.  Yes, even Agon.  They're awkward and don't fit on the shelf properly.  I've skipped a couple of books because they're landscape.<br/><br/>Spiral bound books are irritating too.  They don't open right and can't be put on a bookshelf.  Also, they feel cheap.  I don't really think that they represent nice artefacts and to be hones I'd rather have a PDF than a Spiral bound book.<br/><br/>Speaking of PDFs, I cannot stress how important it is for a PDF to be 28cm by 21.5cm or 11" by 8Â½".  I actually have to print onto A4, so while not perfect, this format is fine.  PDFs in other formats are not printable easily.  All of John Wick's PDFs are left unused on my PC because they cannot be printed.  The PDF of Agon was printed, but then binned largely unread because it was landscape and therefore does not fit into a binder.  I went through merry hell to create a usable copy of Mechaton.  <b>PDFs need to be 28 x 21.5 portrait so they can be printed and put into a binder.</b>  That's what happens to 90% of PDFs so that needs to be possible.<br/><br/>Anyway, that my 2p worth.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: King Turnip</cite>I really enjoyed Mr. Kenrick's Dead of Night format, where it could fit easily into a pocket.  It was one of the primary factors in my purchase.  This size would be especially good if you are making Sanctum to be primarially LARP-- portable and easily concealed=good for LARPage.</blockquote>
Dead of Night is 4.25 x 5.5 - quarter letter, I spose. It's also quite thick, as that format doesn't hold much on a page! Weirdly when selling through distro the size has put retailers off ("it'll get lost on the shelves") yet when selling direct to consumers at conventions the size has been a major draw, as it immediately leaps out as something different. <br/><br/>I'm kinda drawn to square books, such as Covenant, MLWM (which is almost square) and Shock: , but also love more conventional 6x9 books. The size is so right, and feels much more natural and readable than the usual clunky letter sized books we're used to from the mainstream rp publishers. <br/><br/>So I guess I'm trying to say - make it the size you need to to best serve your design goals and ethos. But also make sure it's readable and usable by the end user. I don't really think that many people will be put off by any size, whether 8.5 x 5.5 or 6x9, so long as you've made it usable.                        </div>

                            I have some desire to to publish something in A4/A5 size for political reasons. One format worldwide -- if you can't get with the program, tough. Any rational person can see how the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html" rel="nofollow">ISO paper sizes</a> (sqrt(2):1 ratio across the A series) are superior to the formats used in the U.S. Well, anyone who's had to do a fair amount of size reduction/enlargement with a photocopier, at least.

=P<br/><br/>A 4-ring binder lays flat too and is even easier to add my own pages to.  I <i>like</i> binders for this reason, and given the choice between a spiral bound book and a home-printed-onto-A4-then-put-into-a-binder version of a PDF, I'll go the PDF Route every time.

If I can't print and bind a PDF, I can't make a hardcopy, and therefore cannot run the game.

Some people use and reference PDFs from a computer screen, rather than in hard-copy. This might mean that they're playing face-to-face with laptops. Or it might mean that they're playing online and are looking at a screen anyway, so it's not necessary to print out a hard copy. Or they might have distributed PDF copies of the game to everyone playing so they could get familiar with the rules, and then brought the print edition to the table.<br/><br/>There are some properties or features that make a PDF more useful for screen reference. Those were discussed in another thread some time ago.<br/><br/>Edit: for-print PDFs can also be optimized for that purpose. I really appreciated the print version of InSpectres, which was designed so if you printed it double-sided, you could fold all the pages in half and make a booklet out of them.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>I have a huge rant about the ISO.</blockquote>
Here is my challenge to you, Ben. Name four things you don't have a huge rant about.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>The format Jason used for Roach and Drowning and Falling (21.5cm by 14 cm or 8Â½" by 5Â½") is the format I want to see all book below a certain word count printed in.</blockquote>
I'm fundamentally opposed to Rich's desire to limit all game books to two size options. Some games do, I think, have an ideal format, and there's a few out there that miss the mark. But I want Nine Worlds and MLwM in half-legal, and I want Sorcerer in comic book, and I want Burning Wheel in half-letter. I groove on Agon being 9x7, and I'm happy that the No-Press Anthology is full letter size.<br/><br/>As for PDF, a savvy guy like Clinton makes Donjon available in both the printy format and the screen-viewy format. If I buy a PDF, I'd probably rather have printy be the one available choice.<br/><br/>And where internationally printable PDFs are concerned, the responsible thing for the creator is to leave enough margin so that the printer doesn't have to shrink the page.                        </div>

                            I appreciate that some people use laptops for gaming.  I don't and I don't know anyone around here who does.  I've never actually seen it done, although I hear that some folks do it.<br/><br/>So the statement remains: For <i>me</i> to run a game, I need a hardcopy at the table.  I'm not that bothered if that's come from the author's fulfilment people or my laser printer.  I don't generally buy a game twice, I'll buy one or the other, PDF or hardcopy.  I quite like getting a PDF free with a hardcopy though.  I have uses for PDFs on screens, just not at the table.  But if your game's only available as a PDF, I'm cool with that, as long as you realise that I need to print it out in order to run the game.  I think you'll find that a lot of people feel the same way about having a hardcopy at the table.                        </div>

                            Well, sure, a PDF is the best way to handle the deadly modifications I make to all games but if you are going to sell me a physical book, spiral-bound is still super-sweet.                        </div>

No, I am saying that As-Is, it is very unlikely that you will have to reference Sanctum once you start playing.  This means you don't have to constantly look things up in order to play, because the foundation of Sanctum: The Fallout are things that don't change.<br/><br/>You create the world based on the players and what kind of game you want to run and don't have to look back.                        </div>

                            What you need to get on paper and across to the audience is the main controller of the layout of your book. If you were forced to choose between the 6Ã—9 and 4Ã—6 versions, I'd have to recommend the 6Ã—9 for various reasons mentioned above (information density per page, ease of reading, not getting lost on the shelf, etc.). But if free to choose (and do shop around. The various printing companies offer varying size options), definitely play around with different layouts to see what works best aesthetically for you. This will be a PITA to some extent, as you'll have to reformat and relayout everything for each size option, or at least several pages. And, with the ease of desktop publishing, you can have multiple layouts for the various publising venues.<br/><br/>My humble suggestions: Try to keep the thickness around an inch or less, to save wear on the spine. Try to ensure the book can be read one-handed, or placed on a table and held open with one hand. Preferably, it should lie nearly flat on its own, but that's what those paperweight thingies are for. I think they call them d100s. Keep the binding margin large, to avoid wear on the spine. Stick with larger fonts, like 12pt or even 14pt, if possible, for ease of quickly referincing information.<br/><br/>Some thoughts on the PDF issue. An idea Colin and I have discussed for upcomming releases, like Permafrost and Stories from the Shelter, is to bundle a PDF package with one screen-view aspect ratio (11"Ã—8.25" gives you a 4:3, the standard for monitors for a while, though 16:9 may soon replace it.) and one home-printing aspect ratio (8.5"Ã—11"). It's only a little more effort to switch from landscape to portrait, and we hope it will be a nice selling point. Then we'll have to decide on a POD layout, too. And I am definitely a fan of buy-the-print, get-the-PDF-free.<br/><br/>That's all for now.<br/>SlaintÃ¨,<br/>Q                        </div>
