Those same people also mostly participate for social and creative reasons, which are also curtailed if there's no Forge booth to be in. The more serious folks have formed their own crews when the Forge started curtailing the booth a few years back, but others have simply stopped going. Stopping is especially easy when you've already done the Gencon thing several times and are not getting commensurate benefit out of it once it becomes old hat as an experience.<br/><br/>Meanwhile I understand that there are more up-and-coming conventions in the USA that are friendlier towards the indies to begin with (more room, less bureaucracy, smaller expenses, better crowd), so people are going to those instead of Gencon. I'm no expert on the USA con scene, but I know that I myself can't really be bothered to go to more than a couple large conventions per year, so any competition will cut the Gencon crowd visibly. In fact, now that I think of it, one might say that I myself belong in this population: with Essen Spiel to concern me in the fall I don't have the motivation to worry about Gencon as well.<br/><br/>I'm not aware of outright changes in the Gencon policy, but perhaps somebody else is. It hasn't been particularly easy for the smallest indies to participate ever, really, so I suspect that this is more to do with the natural order reasserting itself than any particular change in the nature of Gencon itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316162/#Comment_316162" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T12:16:40+00:00" title="March 10, 2011 12:16PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know the cost of a shared booth is very high.

It's really amazing to go there and meet all the people whose names I know from online and show off a game and everything, but it's a really grueling experience, and very expensive. And if you're like me and coming from the west coast the expense and fatigue are that much greater. With Maid RPG Andy and I had a game with enough word of mouth to sell out and make enough to cover our booth costs and nothing else, and that was with us sharing a booth and selling in quantities equivalent to a top-tier indie game. I'm gearing up to release another game, and a con that isn't three time zones away and doesn't have a four-digit price tag is sounding like a really good idea right now, especially when hitting up local anime cons may get us much closer to our target audience anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316214/#Comment_316214" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T17:25:01+00:00" title="March 10, 2011  5:25PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with everything here except for "local celebrity." At most reasonably sized meetups, there'll be at least 10-20 "designers" given the continually lowering bar for entry and the fact that a lot of folks have a game or two available (at least as a free PDF) nowadays. Also, sometimes Jonathan Tweet or the like drops by and is treated just like a normal joe.<br/><br/>I don't think GenCon's changed so much as indie designers see fewer reasons to pay the enormous cost of being there when there are other places where we can get together, play games, and sell games that are more exciting, both in terms of the vibe and also the crowds that are there. Also, having PAX on both coasts makes it much more convenient for folks who live anywhere except the Midwest and Texas, and being around video games crowds (where there is excitement about how things are growing and people play all sorts of different games) is way more invigorating than being around the traditional hobby games crowds (where people are continually bemoaning how things are dying or not as good as they used to be or are clinging desperately to the one game they play).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316226/#Comment_316226" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T19:31:25+00:00" title="March 10, 2011  7:31PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gen Con makes for a very expensive lemonade stand.<br/><br/>One of the hot topics on the GPA mailing list is, of course, organizing for GenCon. For those of you that don't know me, I am on the GPA Board of Directors. From what I can gather, Gen Con isn't against Indie publishers. The are for making a profit, though.<br/><br/>Space on the dealer floor is now being sold by the foot, as opposed to the preset islands they've had in previous years. And there is that booth sharing fee now. The high prices and the arrangement makes it very difficult for small publishers to go alone or to group together with other publishers. If you treat your game design and publishing as a hobby job, any of the major conventions are going to be inhospitable.<br/><br/>However, indie publishing did not start with the Forge, nor will it end with it. The Game Publishers Assocation has been booth-sharing before the Forge, and we are still continueing the practice. The vibe of the GPA is quite different, though. You won't read any discussions about theory, or much in game design. The emphasis is on running your publishing company like a business, and sharing information so as to avoid very expensive pitfalls.

Prior to that I slummed at the Jolly Rogers Game booth. The GPA was a good way to go.<br/><br/>Being a Hoosier the East and West coast cons are in the unaffordable range for me. I've never been to Historicon but would love to go - for instance.<br/><br/>Gen is a profit making show for me because we sell stuffed animals. Without the plush we'd lose money. My games have never made more than a third of what the plush makes. Usually a fourth.<br/><br/>I can see how the "big shows" cater to our egos more than economic realities. I want to sell to stores. I think I will meet game store people and game distributors there and suddenly I will be found! Well I have met store and distribution people there but it has not created a Holywood moment. Publishing the Forge way (small independent, usually POD) doesn't fit the three tiered model of business. I've never thought the three tiered system was bad or evil - just different. Most things don't fit it and those games that do are not necessarily good - but then again are not automatically bad either. It just comes down to Gen Con being a land of dreams - which begs the question "How much do dreams cost?"<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316364/#Comment_316364" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T04:39:11+00:00" title="March 12, 2011  4:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gen Con is ridiculously expensive, and they don't care about you at all.

Even moreso in the last couple of years since I've got a game in some form. But the cost of going AT ALL&lt; much less selling at a booth, is ridiculously out of my range. I'd probably get there and have no money to actually <i>spend</i> on all the cool stuff, while still torpedoing the family finances for several months.\\\\<br/><br/>And selling at a booth? fuhgeddaboudit. Selling at my local Portland Area con (<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13893&amp;page=1#Comment_314624" rel="nofollow">Gamestorm</a> is free to me, and I keep all the profits. Selling at PAX even (through the Dreaming Comics), was free and I kept 80% of the profits. And even then I basically only paid for the cost of printing the books plus the cost of going to PAX. Which was GREAT, since I couldn't afford to go to PAX. But it definitely means that GenCon is not a viable option.<br/><br/>By the way, I didn't, personally, find thePAX Prime environment all that welcoming. It wssn't <i>hostile</i>, b ut it was mostly indifferent. I sold OK, but I didn't get to play a lot, and booth passers-by were mostly "eh, nah." The Open Indie Gaming room run by Sage was fun, but it was small, cramped and really just a sideshow. PAX is this huge trade show thing and it seemed to me that the people attending were mostly not caring about us.<br/><br/>If that's more welcoming than GenCon, then yeah, pass.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316403/#Comment_316403" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T13:44:14+00:00" title="March 12, 2011  1:44PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I've participated in a booth at Gencon, the amount I spent to get there has always exceeded the amount I made by over $1000. Indianapolis smells like cat pee, and you have to work to find a vegetable. Gencon is loud and full of some of the worst gaming stereotypes imaginable. The dealer's hall is full of people yelling and blinking lights.<br/><br/>Generally, there are more people there not having fun than I've seen at any other convention. While I didn't have fun at PAX personally, I did see that others were having a lot of fun. At Gencon, it seems like everyone is exhausted, frantic and displeased.<br/><br/>If you live on the west coast of North America, for the cost of Gencon you could go to like 10 different awesome conventions. Gamestorm has an indie booth (called Indie Hurricane) and it's free to sell your product through it. No fees, no percentages. At Go Play, you can sell out of your backpack and easily pay for your badge &amp; meals.<br/><br/>Gencon is a losing proposition on every single front, for me.<br/>The only benefit is seeing East Coast people who I think are neat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316404/#Comment_316404" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T14:30:09+00:00" title="March 12, 2011  2:30PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>The only benefit is seeing East Coast people who I think are neat.</blockquote>\nTRUTH.

Like "You are into that kind of game? Cool! I'm not but whatever! Go have fun." This is the same at Origins. Same at Dreamation.<br/><br/>Apparently it is the place to be if you want to network and go out drinking and firm up contract work and hob-nob. I had more and better hob-nobbery at Origins. Dreamation is a playing con, so not a lot of hob-nobbing.<br/><br/>As a seller I've always found it pretty fun to work a booth, but that isn't very practical any more. And even with a Forge booth subsidy I never did more than break even. I think a scrappy indie booth would be possible at Origins, and the GPA is there, too. Dreamation, not really a selling con.<br/><br/>The after-hours scene is energetic and can be fun, but unless you are secreting your hand-picked team off to a hotel room, it is loud and hit and miss. Plenty of space at Origins, much of it quiet. I had some really, really good games. Best games ever at Dreamation.<br/><br/>You have to work very hard to eat well at Gen Con. You have to walk two blocks at Dreamation. Origins has amazing food right outside the door.<br/><br/>And none of this touches on the small cons - Camp Nerdly, Go Play Northwest, Forge Midwest, etc - these are the places to go if you want to play a particular kind of game and just have fun. Nothing can approach them for quality of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316421/#Comment_316421" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T19:52:34+00:00" title="March 12, 2011  7:52PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An old high school buddy lives in Columbus and has been telling me I should crash with him and go to Origins together.

With a little bit of work I had no trouble finding plenty of vegetarian food, and since I have both a temperamental and vocational interest in a very wide variety of games from indie to trad, I always get real enjoyment from attending. But if you go as a Story Game person, parse it as a trip for fun, it's probably not a great investment as a business proposition. That's OK, it just is what it is, which is the 500-lb gorilla spectacle show, a lot of sensory input and dog-and-pony from the mainstream hobby games industry.<br/><br/>Anecdotally, my multiple attempts to engage PAX East as a vendor were met with stony silence, my many e-mails never responded to, so as with anywhere, it's all in who you know, I imagine. As long as they're willing to eat the cost of giving you space, though, I'd keep taking them up on it.<br/><br/>As far as Origins goes, I am off in two days to the GAMA Trade Show, where I'll be making my pitch to the Executive Director get us some dedicated GoD space. Wish me luck! Even if not, you should go to the show <i>just for the food</i>.

Father Fletch, who runs the whole tabletop event (literally football field-sized) wants to make sure we have plenty of demo space (something we pay $24/sq. foot for at Gen Con), wants to make sure we have ways to get other indie publishers there, and wants to make sure that we're demonstrably distinct from resellers. He also wants us to do <em>more</em> panels. Those panels sell games like nobody's business, and we like to talk. This year, the challenge was getting on panels at all. Next year or maybe even in August), we're assure that won't be an issue.</p>\n<p>I got to play Human Contact with a kid \u2014 16 years old maybe \u2014\xa0who totally got it. He was relatively new to RPGs and was really excited to have an SF one. He made a totally douchey Protagonist and, for once, the world was on the side of goodness and light, defeating the character totally and utterly. The kid was literally clapping with joy about the demise of this asshole he'd created.</p>\n<p>He was just one of hundreds of people I met who had no particularly well-formed ideas about RPGs and just want to play games they haven't played before. They are there to <em>experience new ways to play</em>.</p>\n<p>We also made bank. I have to check in on all my expenses, but I think I came in under $250.

It was a mixed experience. <br/><br/>I think PAX can't be beat for people who want to sell games and I love that they have such an amazing opportunity. But for people looking to play RPGs (beyond demos), it's a different story. There are plenty of positive things to say about PAX (the staff was the nicest con staff I've ever encountered) and I'm glad I attended but it is no way a replacement for Dreamation if you just want to play indie RPGs. Not even close. I would encourage people who don't sell games not to get sucked in by the hype. I'll go into more detail later this week.<br/><br/>That said, I love Gen Con. But it's important to note, I don't sell games. I think we need to separate which con is good for what based on what people want out of conventions. Selling and just playing games are VERY different agendas and often I see the signals being crossed. <br/><br/>Also, I've been going to Gen Con as a person mainly wanting to play a great variety of games with a strong diversity of people for 10+ years. And Gen Con rocks for that (with a few exceptions). <br/><br/>And it is important to note that indie does NOT equal forge games or story games (and the GPA was around before the Forge). I play plenty of indie game at Gen Con every year. When I read Story Games, it sounds like there is this huge exodus from Gen Con. But when I attend Gen Con, I'm too busy playing amazing games to remember what the fuss is about. Last year Gen Con was amazing. Probably my favorite Gen Con experience in the last few years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316511/#Comment_316511" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T01:27:43+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  1:27AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2011 1:38AM by Todd_L.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My comments were a reaction to sentiments such as this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Indianapolis smells like cat pee, and you have to work to find a vegetable.

When it was in Milwaukee I could drive, in Indy I could commute, but we are doing well enough with the stuffed animals that we can get a hotel way out of down town. For me Gen Con is a spectacle and I like that. It is my superbowl. You can certainly be misserable there (especially if you don't eat any vegetables.) With pacing though it is very fun to attend. Some of the best RPGs I've ever played were at Gen Con (when I was an attender not a dealer - now it's work). <br/><br/>I'd love to go to these East and West coast cons some day. Maybe when I retire. <br/><br/>Thanks for all the info. The Gen Con folks should probably read this. Maybe I'll put a link up to it on the Gen Con forum.

For every other purpose (playing games, hanging out with friends and colleagues, doing business, meeting customers it's unmatched) apart from perhaps Dragonmeet, which is a special case.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you have any straightforward suggestions which won't undermine GenCon's bottom line I'll compile them and pass them on. The booth sharing thing is irritating, but can be avoided as long as you don't mind not being listed separately in the convention book.

It might be from going too much (?) leading to general fatigue. <br/><br/>As a gamer: If I want to PLAY something organized, I might as well kiss my chance goodbye to get in anything I want. However, this has led to getting into games that I otherwise wouldn't have looked at (as my first choices are full).<br/><br/>If I want to RUN something organized, GenCon is second to none. I can expect a full table each time. And based on the blurbs I write, I tend to have super-enthusiastic people each time. I've had event cancellations due to lack of heads for various reasons at other cons (local cons, Origins and their scheduling/list fuck-ups etc) but have never run something at GenCon only to get an empty table or less-than-enthusiastic players.<br/><br/>Of course, there's also Gaming With Friends, which is fun.<br/><br/>As a seller: GenCon has quickly gravitated from "*The* Con to debut your game" to "Bullshit" with their elevating table prices and new fees about dual-listing. I don't know of any other con in the world related to tabletop gaming with these prices. If GenCon LLC needs more money they should promote the con more, sell more tickets, up the prices of premier events, whatever. I'm pretty much no longer using GC as a place to debut games, and unless a friend is going and already has a table secured, I'm sure as shit not buying a table to sell games. I'll go to area anime cons, Origins, local game cons instead.<br/><br/>As a buyer: I see the same bullshit as seller. Time for the old fogey in me to come out: I don't give a ratfuck about "How they treat indies", I know it's all about the money and all. But since way back in the day, the thing I loved about the dealers hall even long before the days of the Forge, was wandering around and seeing those 2nd tier/3rd tier games that came out of left field. KULT. Continuum. The Riddle of Steel. Stuff that was unaligned with any "group", almost completely unannounced, but There and Awesome. I love being surprised by some new awesome thing that I never heard of, didn't expect to see. Recently games like Dragons of Kir (a board game) or Outbreak Undead (a cool zombie RPG) hit those marks.<br/><br/>But with the escalating prices, there are far less of these booths at GC. Instead, there are more:<br/>* Used CCG resellers<br/>* Wacky Geek T-Shirt booths<br/>* Utilikilts, bootleggy DVDs, wigs, boffer weapons, etc.<br/>* The "BUY ONE GET THREE FREE!!!!" family.<br/><br/>I imagine that if the trend keeps up, we'll see the dealer's hall turn into basically WOTC, Steve Jackson, Chessex, and a motley collection of T-Shirt, boffer weapon, used CCG sellers.<br/><br/>That's damned horrible. But whatever. Another con will just emerge to be The Place to Unveil Your Game. Might be Origins, PAX, whatever.<br/><br/>Indy smells, but it has some charm too. There's more restaurants and stuff these days. No worse than Milwaukee was. I wouldn't mind if they moved somewhere with more stuff, like Austin or one of the coasts, but whatever.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316529/#Comment_316529" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T08:15:50+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  8:15AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, you mention that the PAX crew are interested in supporting more panels, is there anything in particular the PAX Prime crowd should do to make sure our panels get noticed?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

You're right, Jenskot; it's not there yet as a place to play RPGs. But he's shooting for exactly that, and he wants it to come from indie creators. This year is the first year that PAX was pushing the tabletop area at all, and it's because of him. The grand conspiracy is to make sure that our success this year (and it looks like it was a success to me, and I think to him) turns into more (and more interesting) RPG play next year (or even this year at Prime).</p>\n<p>He's just starting to understand how we work \u2014\xa0how important actual play is to us, how important demoing and co-selling is to us \u2014 and it'll take a bit of conversation before we figure out how to synthesize a real solution.</p>\n<p>I gotta say: nothing beats Dreamation for play, as far as I'm concerned. Without a major structural change, PAX will never have the intimate spaces, the small number of tight, personal connections, or the <em>quiet</em> of Dreamation. I'd like to turn our demo tables into hardcore play tables. I think that would be fun, and we might be able to continue expanding its capabilities from one PAX to the next.</p>\n<p>So, that's where my hopes lie: in making PAX approach the kind of intensive play that we got at the Embassy Suites (remember when that was like ten tables of late night play?) That's not what it is because it's <em>just about to start</em>. Fletch wants to know how to make it happen and is asking us to help.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I get the math for other people, but for me, I've never not made a profit at GenCon\u2014 even including travel expenses. So for me, going with brand new stuff I'm psyched to promote always makes GenCon worth it financially for me.<br/><br/>Also, other than Dreamation and DexCon, conventions have never been about playing games for me. I tend to hit one awesome game per GenCon and spend the rest of the time selling*, and PAX East definitely followed this model as well. So I can't speak to how rad PAX is for playing.<br/><br/>When people asked me how the con was doing for me as an investment, I kept saying "This is the first selling convention I haven't made a profit, but it's also the best selling convention experience I've ever had." Shreyas and I definitely had low expectations for the amount of money we'd make and did not even plan as though we were going to make money from this con (which lead to some of the best meals of my life!). The Enforcers are fantastic, the two panels I attended were SO GOOD, and the people from the panel I organized beat us back to the booth and it lead to some amazing and priceless conversations about helping people make their own games. It went well enough that we're already making plans for Prime.<br/><br/>This isn't to say GenCon is obsolete; in fact, I am sure I'll be back at GenCon in 2012 to network, see old friends and convince you guys my new game is the New Hotness. But for off years, when I don't have a NEW new game, PAX is the perfect substitute because it's a completely new audience, which makes it LIKE having a new game, even if you don't.<br/><br/>*This may be why I make profit at GenCon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

If they weren't remotely interested, they'd look around a little and walk away, though usually saying "oh wow, neat!" first. Far more often, when people didn't know what the games were, they stayed around for a while and on occasion bought something.<br/><br/>It is exactly this lack of familiarity that makes PAXEast such a great opportunity. You're getting a group of people who you are entirely new to, and who are also open to new kinds of fun. Since many or most of them don't identify as RPGers, they also don't as often have their minds made up about whether they ought to like something or not, or what RPGs are, or whether you're on the same side of an ideological battle as they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316577/#Comment_316577" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T12:24:24+00:00" title="March 14, 2011 12:24PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2011 12:25PM by J_Walton.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's the thing, the folks at PAX are, by and large, not regular tabletop players and some may not even be aware that anything interesting is still happening in non-electronic games. But that makes it a largely new-but-sympathetic audience for our stuff.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, most of the labor-of-love-not-venture-capital indie video game developers at PAX Prime 2010 reminded me a lot of their analogues at GenCon. They each had a small table way away from the glitter of TRON!!! or PORTAL 2!!!, they had a single computer screen playing a demo or instructional video of their game on loop, they had a couple of people behind the table just itching to talk to folks, and most of the crowd walked on by, just glancing over on their way to check out Yet Another First Person Shooter.  Their graphics were simple or just a completely different style than the mainstream blockbusters.  The play mechanics were a mixture of old school, contemporary, and totally insane.  Looking back, I wish I'd talked to them about what they thought of the convention.<br/><br/>The video game folks at PAX Prime last year that impressed me the most and reminded me the most of the Forge Booth / Play Collective / Design Matters was actually Harmonix's off-to-the-side setup for demoing Rock Band 3.  Aside from a giant stage in one part of the hall, they had a comparatively tiny 20x20 island space off in the far corner, dwarfed by the giant megabooths.  They had no tables there but instead set up two full Rock Band stations back-to-back in the center of the space.  One employee stood on either side, passing out numbered tickets and calling out numbers.  When you number came up, you and whoever else that was with you jumped onto the instruments and they filled the rest of the band out with whoever else happened to be standing around.  There was never a mike or instrument left empty.  Then the player with the numbered ticket picked the song and you were off. They kept that going all con long, trading out employees in shifts every few hours.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh3KoX-B1rQ" rel="nofollow">This is best video I could find of it</a>, but I thought it was an amazingly indie thing for a major game and major company like Harmonix to do, trusting just on the quality and rep of their game and making sure everybody got a chance to try it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316580/#Comment_316580" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T12:36:13+00:00" title="March 14, 2011 12:36PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2011 12:36PM by Todd_L.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> &gt;Rock Band...kept that going all con long...amazingly indie thing...

It's not enough to say, "I'm an indie game designer." That might work at a con where everyone is very specifically looking for indie RPG's, but since PAX is <i>specifically designed</i> to appeal to a broad gaming base, you'll have a lot of different kinds of people with a lot of different gaming goals.<br/><br/>I successfully pitched both Burning Wheel and Danger Patrol to a dozen strangers without even trying. I had to tell people to stop bugging me, and directed them to the demo booths. Whether or not they bought anything, I don't know, but that's the sort of thing you need to do to point people in the "right" direction.<br/><br/>There are plenty of people at PAX East who want to play indie RPG's; you just have to make them realize it.<br/><br/>RE: The twitter feed: I didn't look at Twitter once, and still managed to find more gaming than I could possibly handle. Just wade into the crowd, sit down next to some strangers, and say "Hey, do you guys want to play a game?" Or ask about what people are playing at the time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bryan</cite>At which point you say, "It'd be even cooler if you bought a game, took it home and played it."</blockquote>Again, that might work at a small con. At a large con, that's a guaranteed way to have me take my business somewhere else.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Without a major structural change, PAX will never have the intimate spaces, the small number of tight, personal connections, or the<em>quiet</em>of Dreamation</blockquote>I doubt PAX will change its entire structure to make that happen. Tabletop at East was infinitely better this year precisely because it was <i>not</i> intimate. The large open space allowed you to find a game almost anywhere.<br/><br/>What PAXE needs to do (and from I hear, this is already in motion) is to better utilize the space in the cafeteria and queue room. I've heard that the queue room in the BCEC is going away completely, and they're going to do more things with that space. This year, a lot of people used the cafeteria as impromptu "quiet" gaming space, and that worked quite well. My hope is that they can isolate an area that is specifically designated for "quiet" gaming.<br/><br/>But the BCEC is otherwise not conducive to lots of little intimate gaming rooms. What I did quite often was wade into the crowd, find people interested in playing a game, and then head to a hotel lobby or even back to someone's room.<br/><br/>It's not ideal, but you can do it if you're looking to put forth the effort.<br/><br/>But generally, a smaller, indie RPG-focused con is going to give you the best indie RPG experience. It's the same way that an RPG tailored to tell a specific kind of story is probably going to give you a better story of that type than you would get from using a "generic" RPG to tell that story. PAX is like The One Con, and it's not going to fill a very specific niche as completely as a small tailored con would.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316584/#Comment_316584" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T13:17:08+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  1:17PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Here's the thing-- that's ALL Pax East is, except for people you know from story games.<br/><br/>The dying breed of 2nd and 3rd tier publishers at GenCon, was never born at Pax East.</blockquote>\nI'm not saying that PAX is the big GenCon replacement (for me and my business, the replacement is "East Coast Anime conventions"), so for me it's not necessarily about "GenCon vs PAX".<br/><br/>But for the same thing, PAX is by all counts far fucking cheaper to run a booth than GenCon, according to Luke's numbers.

Folks would march right up to the booth, "We want a demo." And we did our best to meet the demand, but ultimately we were overwhelmed. We could not entertain everyone who wanted to be entertained. Even so, everyone was patient and everyone was enthusiastic. Some folks had the game, some folks had only heard of it. Everyone wanted to know more about it.<br/><br/>Scores, perhaps hundreds, of people were demanding to play our crazy, overblown roleplaying game.<br/>And from what I saw next door, IPR, Vincent, Joshua, Eppy and company were no less busy. Hell, even Jared ran demos until he couldn't talk any more.<br/><br/>This isn't a "sales vs play" thing.

If the con doesn't support this, you may have to move on or make your own.<br/><br/>The Forge Booth made Gen Con a vastly better experience for Indie publishers, and now that the Forge policies are changing, the Gen Con landscape is changing too. It sounds like some of Gen Con's policies also aren't great for the small publishers who want to set up booths. That's too bad. But it also sounds like there are opportunities there. One of the thing I love about Gen Con is the million or so folks running their own flavor of tabletop fun. I could wander those rooms and watch games all day.<br/><br/>PAX, on the other extreme, is practically new ground for Indies. Sage helped get an Indie room off the ground at PAX prime last year, which changed the whole character of the con from an indie gamer point of view. I know I wouldn't have even gone if there hadn't been that indie room. PAX is a great opportunity to make a new home for RPG-ers and con goers of all sorts.<br/><br/>And there are a growing number of small local cons offering vastly different experiences (Jackson's art-installation RPG con anyone?).<br/><br/>And micro-cons, and birthday cons, and so on. It's a hard field for Gen Con to compete in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13954/why-are-indie-games-suddenly-down-on-gen-con" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13954/why-are-indie-games-suddenly-down-on-gen-con" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13954/why-are-indie-games-suddenly-down-on-gen-con/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13954%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13954%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
