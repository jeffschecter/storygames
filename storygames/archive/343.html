                    First off, how do you attract external playtesters? Having already published a kick-ass game will certainly help, but what if you haven't? Have anyone had any success in getting outside test help and can share how you did it? How do you convince others that the game's actually fun, and that it'll be worthwhile for them to help you?<br/>
<br/>
Also on-topic is how to best set up external playtests. We already have a great thread on how to conduct your own playtests (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=287" rel="nofollow">Tell me how to playtest</a>), but what extra stuff do you have to do with external groups?<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the process of playtesting my noir game, but would really like to have others test it as well. One thing that got repeated in the other thread was that you should only change things between sessions, something I agree with. But with multiple groups running the game you would like to update everyone if one group finds something strange, right? Or would it mess up the tests if rules changed for a group even though they haven't found anything wrong with it? Should changes propagate in real-time, or only to the group that has found the problem?                </div>

                            Post on the Forge, and here, and your blog, requesting playtesters.  Put together a short blurb about the game to advertise it.  Talk about exactly what you need from playtesters in terms of play (several session campaign vs. one shots vs. take the mechanics out for a spin) and feedback (short write-up, detailed summary of rules interactions, etc.)<br>
<br>
Also: bug your friends to do it.<br>

                            Toss it to the folks who hang out at #indierpgs and well be glad to give it a go in IRC.  There haven't been nearly enough pickup games lately, and we should change that.                        </div>
