Two volunteers will <b>take up the roles of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney and audience members will get to decide the fate of the election using Dungeons and Dragons dice, rules and attacks.</b> Smith will act as Dungeon Master of the game, and the ultimate prize is his vote: the battle winner the night of the opening will be the real life ballot Smith casts in his swing-state home of Ohio.<br/><br/>Using the world of sci-fi/fantasy, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and Mormon imagery as a springboard for exploration, Smith has created a world where Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are not just candidates in a race, but also but also mythical heroes in an imagined world. This insertion of major public figures into fantastical worlds is not without precedent, but Smith\u2019s incorporation of religion, fantasy and art history is both unique and unusual. Smith is not interested in labels or lines: an appreciation of the wider sense of the world is required to fully appreciate the work.<br/><br/>Smith\u2019s exquisitely rendered drawings, often ink on paper, are manifest with details. Both highly skilled as a draftsman, and obsessive by nature, Smith imbues his drawings with a radiant energy that draws us into his carefully constructed, and highly coded, world."</i><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.allegralaviola.com/images/CaseypostcardPDFFRONT121026__121026.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393041/#Comment_393041" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T14:18:36+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  2:18PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm headed to the opening now...<br/><br/>Here's "Doomslangers", a group show Casey did last year.<br/><a href="http://www.allegralaviola.com/Exhibit_Detail.cfm?ShowsID=27&amp;CFID=8376027&amp;CFTOKEN=44108291&amp;jsessionid=8430f95abde2d5a50ec1c60355b731e476d1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.allegralaviola.com/Exhibit_Detail.cfm?ShowsID=27&amp;CFID=8376027&amp;CFTOKEN=44108291&amp;jsessionid=8430f95abde2d5a50ec1c60355b731e476d1</a><br/><br/>I think Zak Smith and Mat Brinkmann were also involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
