And yet, every time I try to articulate it, I can't quite get it right. So what it is that we're talking about here?<br/><br/>Here's my stab: "Roleplaying games whose rules are designed to facilitate the creation <i>at the table</i> of a certain type of narrative. In Story Games, story is procedural element of play, rather than a product."<br/><br/>Does that make any sense?

It could be a game where the GM sets up a relationship chart at the beginning! Or, it just might be a shoe! Who knows!<br/><br/>Seriously, the name started as kind of a joke, and it just stuck. There are some things that some of these hippie games do (set up "situation" before play, either through the GM's mouth or through player collaboration; more rules on guiding story, relationships, motivations and other non-physical stuff; scene framing, etc), some things that a very few games do (No GM, high player collaboration, etc), but we (I or whomever) hasn't bothered to draw a line, saying "X Y and Z make a game a Story Game".<br/><br/>The whole thing developed out of a hubub on RPGNet some two years ago or so. There were these great (as in "big", decidedly not as in "good") debates on various games: "My Life With Master is not a Roleplaying Game, because it has an endgame condition. Oh, it's a game alright, and a game where you Play a Role, but it's not a Real Roleplaying Game". Same with Dogs in the Vineyard, Capes, Polaris, Universalis (well, ok, on that front I agree to a point; even the creator says it's not an RPG :-) ), etc. You play a role. And it's a game. But... it's not a roleplaying game. Because of stuff like relationship rules, or endgame rules, or deciding what happened up front and then playing towards that, etc.<br/><br/>So what the fuck are these games, then?<br/><br/>Clinton, back on some blog post he made, said, "I dunno. Maybe we should call them "Story Games"?" (or maybe it was someone else ON Clinton's blog, I forget now)<br/><br/>It stuck.<br/><br/>Oh, they're not roleplaying games? Well shit, I guess we'll have to call them Story Games or someshit then.<br/><br/>Originally, I was going to use this title as the name of my gaming company (Game: Coming Soon! ...Maybe!), but later, when I decided to make a friendly small-press-centric goober fan forum, I decided to use the domain name for that instead.<br/><br/>Maybe some day people will put together a list of definitive qualities. I hope not.

Period.<br/><br/>Now, having said that, there's this whole RPG culture that we're constantly dealing with, most of us here liking this kind of game and finding it only because of our love of RPGs. <br/><br/>So those folks are likely to ask, "What's the difference between a Roleplaying Game and a Story Game"?<br/><br/>My answer is, "Not much. Except for one or two of them like Universalis, you're still Playing a Role". And leave it at that. I call games like Unknown Armies, Dungeons and Dragons and such "Story Games" too.<br/><br/>And furthermore, "BUT, if someone forced me to come up with a definition, it would probably look like this:<br/><br/><i>In most story games, you put down a premise first, then create characters to play out that premise</i>."<br/><br/>Whether that premise is "We must slay the dragon", "You will all die this evening", "You have a demon inside of you that makes you fight with your girlfriend", it doesn't really matter. The stage is set, then the characters are crafted.<br/><br/>This is what I would call a "true story game", but that's just one guy's opinion. And also, that is not anything like a statement of what we can or can not talk about here. I'm just as comfortable discussing stories and GM techniques that can be used in GURPS and D&amp;D with All-Powerful GMs, as I am talking about the Hot New Thematic RPG where all the players have a say in the background/setting creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83233/#Comment_83233" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T11:07:56+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 11:07AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've heard the definition: "Roleplaying games where the normally central role of 'character' is demoted in favour of the 'story' the players communally produce" or something like that.<br/><br/>I don't agree with the definition, for the record. Every really good story I've ever read/heard/experienced was good not on its objective own, but as experienced through the subjective eyes of character(s) whom I had some emotional attachment to. As such, I think character is still the central part of any story game. The difference, in my eyes, is that the rules of a story game emphasizes the creation of a story as an entity rather than just a byproduct of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83240/#Comment_83240" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T11:22:05+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 11:22AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the sticky thread at the top on "The Rules and Purpose of Story Games", there is a post on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4&amp;page=1#Item_4" rel="nofollow"><b>"What is a Story Game?"</b></a>.  Quoting:\n<blockquote><b>:::A Story Game is a type of role-playing game or gaming experience with a lesser focus on My Character and a greater focus on Our Story.:::</b><br/><br/>Playing a game "Story Games Style" is no more important or "better" than playing a game in the traditional adventure game style. Nor by definition must Story Games (the games themselves) contain certain rules or playstyles, emphasis or de-emphasis on a central game-master, light/crunchy rules, etc. Story Gamers are not better. We are not the Chosen Ones. We simply do things a little differently. <br/><br/>Outside of that? It's synonymous with "Dirty Hippie Roleplaying". :-)</blockquote>\nNow, personally I think that proposed clashes of "character" and "story" seem pretty weak to me, since I feel that story flows from character and vice-versa.  However, I get that this means that Story Games are less immersive -- calling for more player point-of-view and action outside of character.

"They're <i>nice</i>, but they're not role-playing games." ("They're nice" is said in the same way that you address the Ugly Blind Date: "He's niiiiiice, but...").

You'll know it when you see it.<br/><br/>But, the really tricky bit? I think the reason we call them story games, particularly on this site, is that they're defined more by what they are NOT than what they ARE. <br/><br/>What they are not, for the most part, is GM-authority driven games. They are not illusionism.<br/><br/>Story games strike me as a line in the sand in regards to that old Forge issue, The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast.<br/><br/>All games must answer that thing -- who controls what part of the game at what time. <br/><br/>All games that I can think of as story games say, "You know what? Fuck the GM and all that old school stuff. It's fine for some. But, I want to have a say in what goes on, too."<br/><br/>This is not to say that there aren't GMs in story games, or even that they don't have considerable authority. It is to say that those GMs do not exercise some arbitrary veto power over people they're playing with who act out, speak up, and choose to do what they want ... and get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83244/#Comment_83244" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T11:34:25+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 11:34AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and the real reason I'm asking is that I'm going to be a guest on a podcast this week talking about this stuff, and I want to make sure I've got it straight in my head before I muck it up on mic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83248/#Comment_83248" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T11:47:55+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 11:47AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2007 11:50AM by Andy.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, BTW, while I will basically kick to the curb anyone (even myself! I ain't perfect!) trying to come up with the Perfect Definition for what it is that will stand the test of time (I don't really see it as a worthwhile enterprise, but rather a self-illusory language problem), I have no problem with people trying to shed light on what they think a story game is by using comparisons, or tendencies.<br/><br/>Frex: When I hear the word "Story Game", I think of a roleplaying game where:<br/>* The players tend to have more story-direction power, not just the GM.<br/>* The players all tend to come up with an exciting story or situation, and then begin to create characters for it.<br/>* Sometimes there's an agreed and defined beginning, middle and end (whether it is 3 sessions or Two Years). You have an end in mind when you start to play.<br/>* The players tend not to show up with their character they made at home before hearing about the campaign. Rather more often than not, the characters are created together.<br/>* The games tend to reward things other than felling foes and combat.<br/>* The games tend to have more rules for non-combat things than more traditional games.<br/>* The games tend to have stats for more than just the physical universe, but rather story-like elements: "I roll my Ennui".<br/>* The players tend to have to put a lot into narration and cooperation and communication, or the game has a higher chance of sucking.<br/>That sort of thing. I have no problem with people trying to do that.<br/><br/>But again, the above is explaining the difference to a roleplayer. When talking to someone new to RPGs, I'll describe D&amp;D (well, run by me anyway) and Dogs in the Vineyard in the same way: "It's like a story where you act out the roles of the characters involved in the story."<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83250/#Comment_83250" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T11:53:53+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 11:53AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree with Matt's view, primarily because I don't believe in the "impossible thing before breakfast" (hurr!), but mainly because I've been calling RPGs "story games" since 1995.

And the game is about the Character resolving that Situation.<br/><br/>* Not about the "plot" first -- which in the past created characters independent from the "story" -- or stories independent from characters. ("Okay you guys come up with the characters, I'll come up with a great plot.")<br/><br/>* Not about the world that the characters explore and discover. (Though this is a lot of fun -- at least to me.)<br/><br/>* Not about the GM's vision which we get bask in (though I've met a lot of people who love this when they love their GM -- and I've never doubted their sincerity.)<br/><br/>* Not about "hanging out with the characters" while they spend 42 minutes buying shoes at the market or whatever.<br/><br/>In a Story Game (in my view), <i>who</i> the character <i>is</i> better be at the nub of the situation, and, in turn, the situation is a crucible for <i>that</i> character.<br/><br/>Without that you get what I call (when I read unproduced screenplays), the "Character Hit by Plot Bus" problem: There's a guy.  He's fairly nondescript, not heading in any particular direction, and WHAM! this Plot plows into him and the story "begins."  But why this guy? Why is this story about this guy?  The writer never says.  And for a many years people tried to meld the generic "adventures hauling cash out of the hole model" to "story." <br/><br/>We get adventurers meeting the stranger in the tavern sending them off on arbitrary quests.  Shadowrunners hired by Mr. Johnson that lead into uber-twisty plots so full of employer-betrayal that any sensible person would quit the job (except that would ruin the game sessions!)  Call of C. adventures where it is simply presumed that people will delve into the horrors of the mythos because -- well, resource managing Sanity is fun, I guess...<br/><br/>For a quick comparison: In Alien (a movie I assume most of us have seen), in the first few minutes of the movie it's clear that everyone on the Nostromo a) Wants to get home to earth and b) has a point of view about their "job," how much money they are getting paid, their relationship with The Company, and their relationship to each other with different status ranks on the ship.  And <i>then</i> they find out they've received a signal of unknown origin.  Because the first part (a group of people trying to get home to Earth), the second part (a signal) gears us up for a story.<br/><br/>In the world of RPGs.... Mike Nystul (<i>The Whispering Vault</i>) ran a game of CoC that was one of my favorite RPG experiences, and my favorite CoC game by far.  Now, there's no dobut that Mike was one of the most evocative GMs I've ever met -- his sense of color and mood (especially for horror) was incredible.<br/><br/>But what made it an engaging experience for me was my Character and his Situation. He was a simple dock worker who saw his daughter "dragged off" by something one night.  He became obsessed with finding her.  With time he discovered like-minded people who had to dig into the depths of the mythos.  He didn't always understand what they were talking about. But he did know one thing: By working with them and continuing to go down the path of his obsession he might find out what happened to his daughter.<br/><br/>A guy. His daughter is dragged off by monstrous forces. He is driven to find out what happened to her. Joe, my guy, could choose time and time again to dig deeper into madness and near-death moment, or step away. He would end up resolving the situation one way or the other (finding out what happened to his daughter, dying, going mad, giving up completely) -- and that would end the situation. And that would end, for all practical purposes the character.<br/><br/>This is a Kicker -- as per the <i>Sorcerer</i> rules, though I would not have used this term at the time since <i>Sorcerer</i> hadn't been published yet.<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons I give Ron a lot of credit. He might not have made up the use of Kickers, but he <i>formalized</i> it in the rules.<br/><br/>A player authored situation that drives the Protagonist and demands closure -- one way or the other.<br/><br/>There are lots of techniques and tools of the trade for story games. There are plenty of way to distribute narrative authority. We can each play a character or share characters or as a group play one character. <br/><br/>But when I look across the board, the one thing that (for me) really stands out is this notion that the only valid way to drive a story is having the character driving it from a situation borne whole cloth from the character.<br/><br/>These are the Issues in <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, the Personality and Relationship Traits in <i>HeroQuest</i>, Relationships and appropriate Traits in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, the Back of the Character Sheet in <i>Sorcerer</i>, the two Background questions in <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, the Spiritual Attributes meeting the world in <i>The Riddle of Steel</i>.... And so on.<br/><br/>Yes. Absolutley. Story Games are stories you <i>play</i>.  But what are you playing?  <br/><br/><i>The Resolution of a Situation borne of who the Character <b>is</b></i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83281/#Comment_83281" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T12:43:05+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 12:43PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesus.<br/><br/>I do go on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83297/#Comment_83297" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T13:35:14+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  1:35PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Story Games are stories you<i>play</i>.

Christopher, you did bring up an interesting point re: Call of Cthulhu.  For me, the tipping point in a game (as in, the one you're sitting down to play, not the RPG itself) is how much influence the characters have over the world.  There was once a Call of Cthulhu setting I played in (Haunted House scenario) where the characters were four dilettantes and a lady adventurer (dilettante with stuff!).  We didn't do *any* research beforehand (unheard of in Call of Cthulhu).  One guy got thrown out the bedroom window three times, we got attacked by the knife in the cellar, decided "screw this!" and burnt the Corvid house to the ground.  The GM (who was very good, btw) looked at us and said "you broke the scenario!"  I would say we played that scenario as a Story Game because what the characters did had a major impact on the game world/the Plot.

How are story games different from roleplaying games: they're not.  It's the same thing, but a different term.  <br/><br/>But people seem to want to make all these clique-y divisions.  Since "indie" tells you nothing about a game's content, people want a word that helps them make generalizations about the content of many games that are related to the indie game movement.  Honestly, I think this is wrongheaded.  Just talk about what individual games are like or what certain groups of games are like.<br/><br/>You can't really talk about what all these games are like except that many of them influenced each other.  But then that's not even always true because, like, Annie Rush's games are not really influenced by other indie games, because Annie doesn't really read or play indie games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83323/#Comment_83323" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T14:38:03+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  2:38PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris K.<br/><br/>Here is something I learned from Ira Glass' long interview on storytelling that got posted on Youtube a while back.<br/><br/>"Frank wakes up.

He slowly gets out of bed and walks to the top of the stairs in this eerie early morning silence. He looks down the stairs and slowly begins to descend, the only sound is his feet on the stairs." is 5 lines of <i>nothing happening.</i> But a storyteller's craft is different from that of a novelist or a short story author.

These games basically all have players that run characters through a story made up of situations largely determined by another player, usually called a game master. Dice or some other randomizing element in conjuction with the rules of the game are used to determine the outcome of rather specific events in the story - does this or that character sneak past the guard, does this pistol shot hit it's target, how hurt is the target, and the like.  <br/><br/>Then a few years ago folks started making games that really pushed the envelope of what is is possible to do with these games. Things like sharing some of the game master's powers and responsibilities among the other players, doing without game masters, using dice to determine broader questions concerning the game, doing without dice at all, etc. Since many of these games departed from the what came before, some people felt they were not REAL roleplaying games. Rather than argue the point a few decided that they'd adopt the term Story Game for whatever they were doing that couldn't be defined as a traditional roleplaying game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83355/#Comment_83355" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T16:53:29+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  4:53PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much like a roleplaying game is a game in which you play a role, a story game is a game about story.

Its about "story first!" You can play a game like D&amp;D and focus on the story, but generally you are playing a "Game, with story." The rules of the game were created with a view towards enabling certain behaviors (casting a spell) or modeling certain events (falling), but there is an assumption that the story will be made to fit the rules. As you drift the game to make story a more central aspect of the game, rules start to be made to fit the story. The question starts to become "what kind of rules will create this kind narrative?" instead of "what kind of narrative can I make out of these rules?" <br/><br/>As with most things, its hard to fix the dividing line between the two kinds of games, but you can definitely compare the extreme ends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83393/#Comment_83393" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T21:49:17+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  9:49PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Yes, but what is the difference between story-games and narrativist games? :-)</blockquote>\nThe term "story game" isn't<b>worse than Hitler</b>.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwins_law" rel="nofollow">Godwin's Law</a> has been invoked.

I think what we do in these games is much more akin to the transmission of myths. This isn't a cosmetic difference, or semantics, but deals with a very real difference not just in media, but in terms of the nature of the content transmitted. For instance, I'm really not concerned with "story arcs" in play. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe above definition of it being play that comes from character issues, rather than "scenario" play, I think hits the mark closest of all. But, to me, the defining characteristic of this sort of play is that it's done so that the players can transmit meaning between themselves. Even if it's silly meaning. And then having the other players understand you as a player a bit better. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

BTW, Chris's ideas are most clearly expressed in his livejournal and some posts with "bricolage" in the title at the Forge (such as <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=14371.0" rel="nofollow">this one</a>); his <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/ritual_discourse_in_RPGs.html" rel="nofollow">article on ritual discourse</a> is both tougher going and less expressive of his thoughts on how "bricolage" relates to categories of RPGs.<br/><br/>I see "story games" as games which give players a lot of formal control over "what happens" outside of their characters' ability to affect stuff (if they even own individual characters). This also includes games were players have the ability to improv a lot of stuff into scenes. Another element I associate with "story games" is strong dramatic scene-framing focusing on thematic conflicts--even if the ultimate scene-framing authority is vested in the GM.<br/><br/>There's an overlap with what I think of as "regular RPGs", but the issue of character motivation and sticking/not sticking to prepared plot isn't anywhere near where I'd put the border region. Instead the division illustrated by Faerieloch is what I'd call a split between "good RPGs" and "boring RPGs where nothing I do really matters". I've played "good RPGs" using D&amp;D and derivatives--and since they have none of the characteristics in my last paragraph, I don't think of them as Story Games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
