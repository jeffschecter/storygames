It was a 5-hour session and I had six players total. One of them had played the game before; the rest had no experience with the game, though a few had played some other Cortex games. Familiarity with the Marvel universe varied from virtually none to moderate fandom. All were male, aged 30s-40s and experienced gamers.<br/><br/>I ran the first act of "Breakout" once again. The players chose the following heroes: Captain America, Emma Frost, Iron Man, Spidey, Thing and Wolverine. An eclectic mix! The session ended up Action-Transition-Action, scene-wise. I think we played through 4-5 total rounds of clobberin', overall.<br/><br/>The initial scene focused on two battles: 1) Cap, Thing, Emma and Wolverine taking on Count Nefaria and the Mob of Villains; 2) Iron Man and Spidey flying after Electro. (Spidey spent a lot of time hitching rides with Iron Man.)<br/><br/>Emma focused on Nefaria, while Wolverine rushed the mob; Cap divided his attention between both. Emma's player did a great job of blasting Nefaria with her mental powers while Cap whipped his shield around. In the end, she managed to control his mind and have him do final clean-up on the Mob! Meanwhile, Wolverine jumped into the Mob and started slashing. I spent a Doom Die to separate him from the other two, being swarmed by the Mob; Wolverine's player was happy to have the d10 Affiliation, but then Cap had to be all heroic and jump in after him, so he was back to a d6. *sad trombone*<br/><br/>Thing punched, well, everybody.<br/><br/>Since I actually remembered to add stress dice to pools this time around, the fight worked out well. With the mob, Cap was doling out emotional stress: "I am the Sentinel of Liberty and you will all STAND DOWN!" That stress die added to Wolverine's pool made him even more effective, and once the mind-controlled Nefaria joined in, it was over instantly.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Iron Man was flying after Electro with Spidey in tow. We managed to avoid any "How far away is Electro from Iron Man" complexity by settling the issue with a roll right off the bat. Electro's flight is pretty low-grade, so it was an easy die pool win for Iron Man to create an "In Range" asset. <br/><br/>The tricky part was when Spidey opted to grab Lykos away from Electro. We rolled for it and Spidey won, but I was unsure how to model that success with the system. Was it just a fact, that Spidey now has Lykos? Or was there some sort of asset brought into existence? I went with the former. Iron Man then repulsor'ed the heck out of Electro and the villain plowed into the side of a building.<br/><br/>Our heroes then convened for a brief Transition scene in which many plot details were revealed, Spidey did some recovering and Iron Man created a "Raft Schematics" resource.<br/><br/>The second Action scene saw the heroes once again divided into two teams: Spidey, Wolverine and Iron Man delving into the bowels of the Raft in search of the power plant; Cap, Emma, and Thing were on a general "secure any escapees" mission, with a cadre of six S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in tow.<br/><br/>Cap, Emma and Thing ("Team America" as we called them) ended up running into the Purple Man and Hydro-Man. I had bought off Purple Man's "Drugged" complication, so he was at full effectiveness, and paid another Doom Die to have him attack first. He led off by mind-controlling the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, ordering them to turn around and shoot the heroes; he completely turned two of them in one shot, semi-effected three others, and whiffed on the last (I ran out of effect dice, having to total three dice for the result). Emma proved unable to overpower Purple Man with her mind control. Cap was mostly effective at getting the agents to shake off PM's yoke, once again attacking them with the force of his patriotism; I really loved that the player focused on this aspect of Cap!<br/><br/>Thing, of course, proceeded to punch out PM in one shot, rolling multiple d12s in his pool; it was pretty badass.<br/><br/>What of Hydro-Man, you wonder? After one mildly-effective attempt to create a drowning complication, he surrendered once our heroes (with Cap at the lead) demoralized him with Emotional stress. <br/><br/>"Really? A D-lister taking on CAPTAIN AMERICA, THING, and THE WHITE QUEEN? Are you sure you want to do this?"<br/><br/>"Oh, sweet God, don't kill me! I give up!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the others heroes found themselves trying to get power back on line. Spidey attempted to aid Iron Man with his science/tech specialties, but to no avail. Iron Man managed to jury-rig the blasted generators regardless, but took some physical stress from the massive electrical feedback.<br/><br/>Wolverine was on guard this whole time, which was good, as Carnage had followed them down the elevator shaft! Spidey's player actually had no clue who Carnage was (nor Electro), so when the big reveal came ("It's... Carnage!") everyone else gasped while Spidey was like, "Who?"<br/><br/>I had thought this was going to be a rough fight, but once again, teamwork paid off. Wolverine did his thing (stress), Iron Man shot the ceiling above Carnage to bring down a massive girder on top of him (complication), and then Spidey just kept webbing the hell out of Carnage, upping the complication until the villain was completely cocooned. Avengers, assembled!<br/><br/>In all it was a much more fun and smooth-running session than my first. I made a point not to explain too many rules up front; instead, we learned rules as we needed them, slowly adding on layer after layer. I think this paid off, as there were a lot fewer questions and blank looks than my first attempt to teach the system. Overall, I don't think there was any aspect of the rules that the players didn't "get" in at least a basic way.<br/><br/>At first, things did move pretty slow. Six players really is a LOT for this game. I could see some of the guys drifting as they waited their turn, checking cell phones and whatnot. However, they were attentive and enthusiastic when their turns came around. The pace picked up as we went in to the second Action scene and they became more familiar with the rules and their characters.<br/><br/>I will admit, however, that I almost entirely avoided Milestones. I explained them up front, one of the few rules I talked about all initially, and gave them the option to choose Milestones from the event or their data files. However, I knew that XP really didn't make a big difference in terms of this as a one-shot, so I did not press it too hard. Thing's player did a little bit with his "Heart of a Prince" Milestone at first, but that was about it. Honestly, these guys seemed happy to just indulge in their heroes as-is, grooving on being Iron Man for the sake of being Iron Man, and so forth.<br/><br/>Once again, I relied very heavily on <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16004&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">jenskot's cheat sheets</a>. I had my iPad with me but didn't reference my PDF too much. This was partly due to being more familiar with the rules, and partly, in all honesty, because I felt like looking anything up would take too much time.<br/><br/>There you go! Hopefully I will be running MHRP again at Forge Midwest and an upcoming game day at the FLGS. I'm debating whether to run Breakout Act 1 again, try Act 2, or perhaps make up my own event.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368589/#Comment_368589" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T07:27:24+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  7:27AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome AP.<br/>This makes me increasingly excited to do regular events at my own FLGS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368632/#Comment_368632" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T11:54:52+00:00" title="March 20, 2012 11:54AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!<br/><br/>I kick myself now as I realize that we had a Transition scene, and you can spend XP in Transition scenes. Ergo, I could have pressed that they use their Milestones, and then we could have actually experienced XP expenditure. One to grow on!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
