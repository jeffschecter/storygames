I'm Matt.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how terminology has shifted since the Forge days (and I get the sense, from lurking over the past few months, that terminology is much less of a big deal in this space), but there's that thing that once was called Director stance.  Maybe now it's just "story gaminess".  I, the player, influence our game not through the abilities of my character, but through things I personally would like to see happen.<br/><br/>Everybody knows what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>There are "trad" games that offer this, with Bennies, Fate Points, etc.  These Meta-Points (MP, for brevity) are, in my experience, doled out sparingly and pretty tightly curtailed.   Get a reroll, or a minor plot declaration ("Yes, there is an awning that could catch you.").  <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Ok, here's the deal.<br/><br/>All the time (by which I mean often) in the stories we love best in film or fiction, there are characters of differing efficacies running around together.  Batman + Robin.  Aragorn + Pippin.  Obi-Wan + Luke.  Indy + Short Round.  Superman + Batman.<br/><br/>To make this fun in-game, it's no good beefing up Robin.  Then he's Nightwing and we've missed the point.  Let's do this, instead: <br/>Batman is a bad mofo and has huge Str and Dex.  And few MP.  <br/>Robin is pretty puny, but has a ton of MP.<br/><br/>Sounds good so far.<br/>BUT.<br/>If Robin has 12 MP, and the best he can do is get rerolls or the occasional chandelier, that still sucks.  With 12 MP, the player should be able to really play an active role in guiding the game.  Cool!  Eh, wait, what <i>can</i> you do with 12 MP?<br/><br/>This, I imagine, will require some delicacy to balance.  I have some ideas, but I'm wondering what's out there already that I'm not aware of.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Question:<br/><br/>Can anybody throw me some suggestions here, games where the MPs can be spent in a ton of ways, with differing costs for different effects?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476669/#Comment_476669" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-12T19:47:04+00:00" title="September 12, 2018  7:47PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2018 7:48PM by DeReel.">edited September 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With flashy powers in mind, I'd say Anima Prime is something like this.

As you write, there is lots of fiction like this.<br/><br/>I think that simply thinking in terms of "points you can spend for effects" is a limited way to look at it, however.<br/><br/>One of my favourite examples is the Mortal in Monsterhearts. Unlike the other characters, you have less fictional "power" - you're not a monster, you have no supernatural strengths, and so on - but your particular character's design makes you magnetic, important. You may be a victim, but you're the most interesting and popular victim: the game pushes you to make yourself vulnerable, but, in the process, you become the center of attention.<br/><br/>The Mortal doesn't have any special "director stance" powers (ability for the player to directly influence events outside the reach of their character's particular fictional means), but either rewards or is rewarded when other characters take advantage of them, which incentivizes everyone to do so on a regular basis.<br/><br/>Here's an example of what that might look like in your hypothetical Batman &amp; Robin game, for a super simple illustration:<br/><br/>* Batman has powerful stats and can really kick ass.<br/><br/>* Robin cannot, not to the same extent.<br/><br/>However, Robin has emotional sway over Batman, and maybe some clever insight.<br/><br/>The rule is:<br/><br/>Whenever Batman follows Robin's plans or ideas - acts according to what Robin wants - he gets +3 to his rolls. (And maybe Robin scores XP every time this happens, or some such.)<br/><br/>If the opposition is dangerous enough that Batman really *needs* that +3 bonus, you're going to get a very interesting power dynamic happening between the two. Robin needs Batman's help and protection, but Batman needs to ask Robin for advice before acting (and then do as he says) or he's likely to fail.<br/><br/>I think that's a fair bit more interesting than simply having more points to spend for "director powers". <br/><br/>Another example:<br/><br/>Batman is the strong one, as before. However, the plots we face are all about the sidekick (Robin). Each "adventure" starts with Robin telling us about some of his fears, and what he treasures most. The GM (or whoever portrays the opposition) now creates threats and dangers based on those fears.<br/><br/>Now we get a game where Batman is the mechanically effective one, but every story we play out is effectively <i>about Robin</i>. (And, in a sense, Robin's player is exercising some creative authority in inspiring and defining the scope of the dangers and bad guys they deal with.)<br/><br/>In short, I'd be looking for ways to create synergy between the two characters, so that they need to interact with each other in order to get what they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476671/#Comment_476671" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-12T20:08:26+00:00" title="September 12, 2018  8:08PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I seem to remember that the Buffy the Vampire Slayer game used this kind of mechanism to balance the powerhouse characters (Slayer, vampires, werewolves, etc.) with the normal high school students who made up the rest of the player group.

This is not a foreign concept to reality, after all: we all are part of a great many vehicles of resolution that utilize both less and more important participants, working together, to succeed. Most of us are, most of the time, not the most important member of the team.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476673/#Comment_476673" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-13T07:26:08+00:00" title="September 13, 2018  7:26AM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2018 7:34AM by EmmatheExcrucian.">edited September 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually have a lot of thoughts about dichotomies of weaker-stronger characters because there was an arc in my group's ongoing Chuubo's campaign that we just finished recently that did a lot with the weaker character-stronger character dichotomy. <br/>The stronger PC was effectively an unbeatable shounen protagonist. The weaker PC (my character) was basically just a physically disabled teenage girl who knows a bit of magic but was generally only really competent at like emotional support stuff. <br/><br/>The stronger PC was up against a threat she couldn't just punch though, so her shounen hero powers weren't doing a lot of help against it. She was faced with the threat of being corrupted by an evil goddess who wanted to turn her into basically a world-eating monster. The evil goddess was consistently corrupting her heart through their metaphysical bond. When the evil goddess showed up in the flesh, the shounen hero could kick her ass if they got in a direct fight, but the evil goddess was good at getting under her skin and corrupting her through indirect methods, and when the shounen hero had corruption in her heart, the evil goddess was stronger when fighting her, because of the fact that the corruption made the shounen hero have trouble resisting the evil goddess's commands. <br/><br/>This is where my character's stuff comes in! The tiny bit of magic that my character knew at the time essentially allowed her to purify people's hurts of corruption, but it was extremely difficult and physically strenuous on her to do it (especially with the fact that a big part of my character's storyline during that arc was her struggling to deal with her new physical disability after a string of injuries, a lot of which is based in chronic pain). <br/><br/>So then my character was getting to be exciting and cool in the conflict with the evil goddess despite the fact that if she got in a physical fight, she would easily get her ass kicked. <br/>Whenever the evil goddess and her minions were physically attacking the PCs and their friends, the shounen hero was fighting them off with her overwhelming physical force, and protecting her friends through kicking the ass of anyone and anything who tried to hurt them. But she was able to do it because of my character purifying her heart. If my character hadn't been there, the shounen hero would have fallen to corruption and wouldn't have been capable of using her overwhelming physical power to fight the evil goddess, because she would have been completely under her control.<br/><br/>In short, a huge part of making the dichotomy between a weaker character and a stronger character work is for there to be aspects of the situation that the stronger character is trying to deal with that they couldn't do if it wasn't for some (probably niche) ability that the weaker character has. <br/>Basically, the weaker character does their cool stuff so that the stronger character is able to do their cool stuff, and then everyone benefits and has fun, because alone neither of them could handle the situation, but together they can do it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476674/#Comment_476674" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-13T08:40:10+00:00" title="September 13, 2018  8:40AM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...So, yeah, abstract "director power" points - as in Fate - and unlocked "manipulate outcome" bennies - as in <i>The Pool</i> - <b>might</b> cover all of the above, is we were fixated on creating a "do it all" rules system that nonetheless included the quite old-fashioned idea of allocating points to create a PC.<br/>Or, like some posters to this thread, we might be way past that already, focused on the sort of dramatic dynamic we want to achieve.

And the outcomes can be rules-breaking once a session stunts, or FP powered special abilities, but usually people just seem to choose to specialize and have a flat +2 to a specific use of a specific skill.

This ability to create game developments/ complications is what I'm thinking about.  <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Batman &amp; Robin are my thread exemplars, but my vision is more LotR: many characters, sandboxing around, at a spread of playable efficacies.  Paul's idea of having hard-wired interpersonal dynamics (Batman gets a +3 for taking Robin's advice) is good, and probably better than where I'm at, but feels like I'd need either a more focused game - "Hero and sidekick fight crime," for example - or else something like playbooks.<br/><br/>DeReel pointed me toward Anima Prime, which seems to offer a ton of powers, each with a set cost.  If these were chosen at character creation, it'd essentially be possible to build your own playbook of moves.  If they're available on the fly, then it's a pile of pre-formulated options.  <br/><br/>I'm in a less-granular-more-freeform space.  I guess I like the feel of a clear distinction, a balance between [the mechanics] and this other thing which is [whatever your mind can dream up].  A few guideposts to help establish costs, but other than that we're wide open. <br/><br/>And maybe liking this tension is what keeps me out of pure hardcore story gameness.  I like peanut butter, and I like chocolate, so I have this sense that the combination of flavors might be fun.  <br/><br/>Thanks for the input so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476686/#Comment_476686" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-15T21:51:55+00:00" title="September 15, 2018  9:51PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can very well imagine a LotR game where the hobbits are totally balanced against Gandalf and Aragorn because of their game-breaking, exclusive ability to carry the One Ring and resist its corruption.<br/>But if you handwave away the One Ring in your game about the Fellowship fighting their way through Moria, then... then it's some iteration of D&amp;D where the hobbits are level-0 and everybody else is quite high-level.<br/>So, it basically depend what your game is <i>about</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" title="The_Bearded_Belgian"><img alt="The_Bearded_Belgian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476690/#Comment_476690" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-16T02:19:16+00:00" title="September 16, 2018  2:19AM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Garbanzo" rel="nofollow">Garbanzo</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I need to dig into Fate!
