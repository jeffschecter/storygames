While there's obviously a ton of excitement for these types of, umm... let's call them "abbreviated" designs, there's been some concern over how much these games---in their current form---rely on pre-existing player knowledge. That lead to this exchange:\n<blockquote><cite><a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/somethings-brewing/#comment-4614" rel="nofollow">timfire</a></cite>You know what this makes me think we need for this sort of thing to work?<br/><br/>We need a book that presents one or more simplified "models of play", followed by a whole bunch of techniques/mechanics, followed by some discussion of how the various models and techniques interact.<br/><br/>From there, someone could just throw together a little 5-page document like John did and be ready to play.<br/><br/>I know that\u2019s basically how other "modular" games work, but the distinction here is that the "system"/book would focus on play techniques, rather than on mechanics. And rather than have a "game" that simply gets tweaked, the idea here would be to have a generalized "form" (like, let\u2019s say, "jazz music") that is then processed into specific implementations (like, "a jazz song").</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite><a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/somethings-brewing/#comment-4617" rel="nofollow">Jonathon Walton</a></cite>That sounds like an excellent project for someone to take on, and I'd love to help with it.</blockquote>\nI don't mind heading up such a project, but I have neither the time nor energy to do it all by myself. So I thought I would open it up to y'all, and we'll see if anything becomes of it. For the moment I'm just thinking that from time to time I'll start a discussion on a given topic, people can leave their comments, and when it's over I'll compile the info. <br/><br/>I'll start here, to gauge if there's any interest.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vision</span></b><br/><br/>So what's the deal here? The idea I had writing that post was that we could create a framework of play. As such, the idea---as I see it---wouldn't be to include "everything under the sun", but rather to point play in a particular direction.<br/><br/>Towards that end, at the moment I'm not terribly interested in trying to create something "new". I would rather create something that's usable by the community of "story-gamers" right now, and just highlight the play culture surrounding indie games. As I see it, that would mostly entail cataloging all the major play techniques and popular mechanics that have arisen over the last few years.<br/><br/>Again, the idea would be to create a sort of "how to play" text, so people can just throw together quickie 5-10 page design and be ready to go.<br/><br/>In the end, I envision the info being available for free in some form, but I'm not committing to anything right now.<br/>__________<br/><br/>What do y'all think? Questions?<br/>If anyone has thoughts on what they would like to see in such a project, feel free to share them!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202764/#Comment_202764" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T11:53:39+00:00" title="April 20, 2009 11:53AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, this is surely interesting, but can you clarify?

Who controls each different characters? etc. <i>[This would generally describe <b>what</b> participants do.]</i></li>\n<li>Following that would be a couple different models of play, like "strong GM" (Sorcerer, Dogs), "players drive the action" (PTA, Mountain Witch), "rotating GM" (Polaris, Shock), "Party play" vs "Individual characters", etc. <i>[This would describe general play <b>strategies</b>, as well as elaborate on <b>who</b> exactly does what.]</i></li>\n<li>From there I would probably go into general play techniques, like bangs, flags/kickers, fishing, conflict vs task resolution, etc. Again, this would focus more on the at-the-table how-to's, with a bit of discussion of how various techniques fit together (like, "write bangs that address a player's flags"). <i>[This would describe specific play <b>tactics</b>, as well as expand <b>how</b> players do different things.]</i></li>\n<li>After that I would probably describe specific (popular) mechanics, stuff like Fan Mail, Keys, Fate/Hero/Destiny Points, etc. Here it wouldn't be so much cataloging everything out there, but rather pointing out mechanics that have a significant effect on play, and how to best utilize them in play.</li>\n<li>Finally, and only at the end of all that, I would discuss how different stuff can be added together and what additional info is needed to "make" a game (it would be cool to have some sort of "work sheet" people could fill out)... <i>[Hmm, though now that I think about it, I'm not sure if this section would actually be needed, or if the principles would already be implied by earlier advice.]</i></li>\n<li>Oh, and I guess to end it, it would probably be cool to include a couple example 5-10 page (intro?) games.</li></ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202791/#Comment_202791" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T13:35:50+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  1:35PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2009 1:36PM by Chris Peterson.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you guys read John Kirk's "Design Patterns of Successful Role-Playing Games" PDF book?

It's not a trivial task to postulate and verbalize these; for example, to date there are just about two different models of narrativist play floating about, and only one of them is really well-developed (this'd be Ron's Egri-based model of protagonist-choice).

Before that, I'd thought of doing something like that as kind of a Roleplayer's Toolkit.  But yeah, time and energy.  This is a vast project, and if anyone can pull it off, kudos to them.  That's why I thought the wiki approach might be better, where people can add and edit over time.
