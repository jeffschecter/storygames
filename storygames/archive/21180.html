Something like:\n<blockquote>Each time you try something you add 2 stones to the bag: <i>add 2 white stones if you have advantage, 2 black stones if you are in disadvantage and one of each color otherwise.</i> <br/><br/>Then you draw 2 stones at random from the bag: <i>2 white stones mean success, 2 black stones mean fail and one of each means a success with a sacrifice.</i></blockquote>\nWhile exploring several variants of the basic idea described above (<i>draw N stones, initial content of the bag, return the drawn stones to the bag, what happens if you run out of stones of one color, etc...</i>) I started to wonder what has already been done in terms of negative feedback loops mechanics.<br/><br/>So, <b>can you please provide references of games where the concept of negative feedback loop has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a central role</span>?</b><br/><br/>For example, games like James V. West's <b>The Pool</b> or Rob Lang's Shared <b>Pool System</b> implement a negative feedback loop where past outcomes affect the size of your dice pool, which in turn modifies your future probabilities of success. The negative feedback loop is not the unique relevant aspect of these systems (there is also an interesting <i>push-your-luck</i> mechanic) but has, nonetheless, a central role.<br/><br/>Robin D. Laws' <b>HeroQuest 2</b> suggest that the GM must implement a negative feedback loop by setting the difficulties of the rolls in a way that emulates the classic <i>Pass/Fail Cycle</i> of the epic narrative. In this case the negative feedback loop is not inherent to the system as it appears only in the GM advice section.<br/><br/>Somehow in the middle there are many systems that give the players some kind of karma tokens each time they fail so they can use to improve future rolls. In that sense, <b>Fate</b>'s Fate Point Economy implements some kind of negative feedback loop but I can hardly consider it <i>central</i> to the system since you have many other mechanics interacting with it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464078/#Comment_464078" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T16:39:08+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  4:39PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/" rel="nofollow">Tales of Entropy</a> has this in spades - it was the original inspiration around which the game was built. The designer is similarly interested in the idea as you seem to be.<br/><br/>Specifically, how the game works is that after every conflict the winner's degree of success is translated into "burden" - meaning consequences - by the loser. The harder you win, the greater the entanglements you create. These character burdens come up in later conflicts as "burden challenges" where a seemingly victorious character may be brought low by the burdens they've been dragging with them from the past.<br/><br/>As a concrete example, when we played a Star Trek scenario with the game, the old ship captain (approaching senility after a glorious career) whose authority was being questioned by the crew seized social control by being pretty harsh towards his bridge officers in public. He affirmed his position (as opposed to being deposed by his first officer as unfit for duty), but obviously also gained the burden "Resented by the Crew" at I think 4 points or something like that. Later on, this burden would play a part whenever the crew was working under his orders, pretty much.<br/><br/>The fact that the losing party chooses the winner's burden is interesting, because it enables them to significantly colour the general narration of the events. The winner gets to describe how they win, but the long-term consequences and their mechanical impact are up to the loser.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464079/#Comment_464079" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T16:51:30+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  4:51PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you familiar with the Anti-Pool version of the Pool?

Also, you may choose to play low-value cards at less critical moments to intentionally fail, in order to either preserve a higher-value card in your hand or in the hopes of tossing out the dross for something better. Generally speaking though, the deck skews towards middle value cards, so the effects aren't always very pronounced. <br/><br/>I imagine this is largely true for any system that uses a spread of predetermined values rather than "spontaneous" (a la die rolls) generation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464088/#Comment_464088" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T17:54:12+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  5:54PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't any game that gives you wound penalties feature a central negative feedback loop?

A thermostat+AC is an example of a negative feedback loop: higher temperature results in more cool air blown, lower temperature results in more hot air blown.<br/><br/>Ways to detect negative feedback loops include values which are suspiciously stable despite seeming like they'd be changing, or cycles that seem to emerge without being specified.<br/><br/>So for example in a well functioning Burning Wheel game, you can detect the likely presence of a negative feedback loop by noting that players always seem to hover around 1-2 Persona and a handful of Fate. Because when you have more than that, you might as well spend some, and when you have less, you hoard it, and there's a periodic income. If players continually have no artha, something's wrong with your income or you're not giving enough low Obstacles. If players' Fate keeps going up, you're not giving them chances to spend it.<br/><br/>Loot +&gt; Town Trips -&gt; Loot is definitely an example, and not silly, but specifically designed, and you see a similar thing in many games, where the processing of the loop produces other effects you want regulated.<br/><br/>Another really common one is enemy difficulty / character power. Blow through a dungeon, decide you can take on much harder enemies, and you have a much higher chance of failure next time.<br/><br/>Another BW one is armor failure: roll some d6s, and if any die shows up 1, you lose a die of armor. Quite likely at 4d6, but fairly unlikely at 1d6 after three failures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464106/#Comment_464106" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T20:24:16+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  8:24PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, my bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464137/#Comment_464137" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-18T07:37:47+00:00" title="June 18, 2017  7:37AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2017 7:39AM by BeePeeGee.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm reminded of the <b>Cortex Plus Doom Pool</b> used especially in the Marvel Heroic RPG (<a href="http://www.d20radio.com/main/rules-lawyer-the-doom-pool-reserve/" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a small overview).<br/>Similar to players' plot points, it gives the GM a pool of dice that can be rolled against the players or used for special moves (i.e. GM spends 2d12 for the villain to escape the scene).<br/>The doom pool mechanic leads to a nice action/reaction balance between PCs vs opposed NPCs and has the mentioned "thermostate effect" as the doom pool grows and deflates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna" title="CarlosLuna"><img alt="CarlosLuna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/043/n8G0MTMMVZLJN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna">CarlosLuna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464182/#Comment_464182" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-19T18:04:45+00:00" title="June 19, 2017  6:04PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for your suggestions, I will take a closer look to all games you cited but I'm looking for something more raw and simple than most of the mechanics you described.<br/><br/>I know that many games use some kind of balancing mechanic that induces a negative feedback loop in the long term, but I'm trying to determine whether a single negative feedback loop mechanic can generate results that are interesting enough by itself or if it is necessary to add other elements like <i>push-your-luck</i>, <i>resource management</i> or <i>standard dice rolls</i> to make it work.<br/><br/>I mean, <b>is it too boring or too predictable to let a single negative feedback loop to drive all the outcomes of the history?</b><br/><br/>Let me illustrate what I mean with a simple example: put 4 white stones and 2 black stones in a bowl. Every time that you want to do something draw a stone at random:\n<ul>\n<li>White means <i>Success</i></li>\n<li>Black means <i>Fail</i></li>\n</ul>\nEvery 4 actions you reset the system by placing the 4 drawn stones back into the bowl. All the outcomes are guided by JUST the mix of stones that remain in the bowl (so they are a function of the previous outcomes, rather than of the situation or the character).<br/><br/>Is this annoying or boring to play? I mean, the fact that no matter what you try or who you are, your chances of success are the same and only depend on what happened to you lately.<br/><br/>I know that this is a really extreme case but my point is:\n<ul>\n<li>Is it possible to build a story-game based <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just</span> on the idea of negative feedback loop?</li>\n<li>Does this kind of self-regulating mechanic provide enough structure?

To me the issue is that with your scenario, as soon as you draw your two black stones, any draws before replacement are free wins (and the player knows they are free wins). Now to me at least, free wins are boring, but what if you turned it around to be 4 black and 2 white? Now you have a game where your character is predestined to fail and to often be faced with the immediate knowledge that her next action will fail. That could be interesting. But possibly not something people will want to play a lot. <br/><br/>*edit* The big challenge still would be for the players to embrace this doomed element and to think of narratively interesting ways to have their character try to do something that the players know to be doomed. Whether the character is aware of this, I'm not sure. The thing that definitely wouldn't work is for the player to try and min/max this and attempt trivial tasks when they're on a guaranteed fail. <br/><br/>Oh, and while I'm here, this biased negative feedback (4 vs 2 in the bag) also misses the opportunity to do a "balance in all things", which could also be interesting (if not fun).<br/><br/>The more I think about it, this idea seems to speak more to the setting of a game and the kind of story you want to play. And that's why I lean toward the neutral or ill-fated ones as being more interesting. Lots of game have an implicit assumption that the characters will basically succeed, though with some trials along the way. This system could make that explicit by setting the probability of them succeeding to 0.66 (over the long term). Fewer games presume in advance that the characters will fail or have a near perfect balance of setbacks and triumphs.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna" title="CarlosLuna"><img alt="CarlosLuna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/043/n8G0MTMMVZLJN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna">CarlosLuna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464212/#Comment_464212" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-20T16:28:32+00:00" title="June 20, 2017  4:28PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: You are right, I'm being a little bit too vague (or too abstract) here. That's why I started asking for examples of what have been already done.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/uolmir">@uolmir</a>: The example was just this, an extreme example to try to raise this kind of observations. I tend to agree that knowing in advance the outcome of a roll (as you pointed) might lead to <i>munchkinism</i> so it is preferable that each draw has some degree of uncertainty as in the first example I posted:\n<blockquote>Each time you try something you add 2 stones to the bag: add 2 white stones if you have advantage, 2 black stones if you are in disadvantage and one of each color otherwise.<br/><br/>Then you draw 2 stones at random from the bag: 2 white stones mean success, 2 black stones mean fail and one of each means a success with a sacrifice.</blockquote>\nunless, of course, you want to explicitly make the players feel invincible (or hopeless) from time to time.<br/><br/>I'm concerned, however, with the amount of (negative) feedback that the systems provides, as I was looking for something that changes more dramatically, in shorter periods of time. This can somehow be tunned by reducing the size of the initial mix of stones in the bag (let's say just 2 black and 2 white stones) but a smaller bag of stones means that 100% probability of success (or failure) cases will appear more often unless you specifically put a rule in place to avoid them.<br/><br/>All of this makes me think that I should look for some kind of <i>bidding</i> or <i>resource management</i> mechanic (instead of just a random draw) and that was, again, why I was asking for more examples of implementation of negative feedback loops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464218/#Comment_464218" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-20T18:31:10+00:00" title="June 20, 2017  6:31PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made a negative feedback loop game for you. It's not quite minimalist.<br/><br/>PCs have two ability scores: Law and Chaos. During character creation, divide 7 points between them, min 1. Do stuff. When the GM asks you to roll, check if your current action is more aligned with Law or more aligned with Chaos. Use that score. Suppose it's Law 5. Roll 5d6. Your opposition, say, is 3d6. You roll {6,5,2,2,1} versus their {6,4,3}. Take your 6 (match) and your 5 (win) and physically move the dice into the center of the table, away from you. You succeed!<br/><br/>Next time, though you have Law 5, you will only roll 3d6.<br/><br/>Eventually you roll Chaos and fail. This is a sign to you that you should not be Chaotic, as you failed. So retrieve all of your lost Law dice. They are available to you once more. If you had no lost Law dice, instead take a Bonus Powerup Law Is Super Right die (you may only have one of these at once (maybe)).<br/><br/>If your action was clearly Neutral rather than Law or Chaos, you automatically fail and lose a die from both Law and Chaos and have to do 10 pushups. If you try to roll Law or Chaos with 0 dice, instead roll 1 free die which may win on a tied 1 result and that's it.<br/><br/>So a few negative feedback loops here.<br/><br/>First, the more you succeed now, the less likely you are to succeed in the near future, especially if the opposition was tough, and the more you fail now, the less likely you are to fail in the near future (if you switch approaches).<br/><br/>Second, the more you act as Law now, the more incentive you have to act as Chaos in the near future, and the more you act as Chaos now, the more incentive you have to act as Law in the near future.<br/><br/>(Third, the more you act as Neutral now, the harder your pushups will become and the less you'll want to act as Neutral in the future.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464226/#Comment_464226" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-21T09:03:22+00:00" title="June 21, 2017  9:03AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Doesn't any game that gives you wound penalties feature a central negative feedback loop?

If you win, you get what you want... If you lose, you gain a Feature, which means you roll an extra die in future conflicts. This involves no player choice (it feels more like a pity prize) but it actually defines a playing field for the <i>Antagonist</i> player, who starts with a pool of conflict dice and has to decide how many to spend each turn on opposing the Protagonist's intent. If, as the Antagonist, you really want to make the Protagonist fail, you have to "give" at first, letting them win the first conflict or two, then hit them with the max number of dice in the last one. If, on the other hand, you hit them hard since the very first scene, you set them up to succeed in the end. Basically, the Antagonist player gets to choose whether to frame the story as a the struggle of an ultimately victorious underdog, or a downfall - though there's still a lot of randomness involved.<br/><br/>Ben Robbins's <i>Follow</i> uses a bag of stones much like the OP's game.

Let's do this. When you're talking about a negative feedback loop, you're talking about a control system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system</a><br/><br/>Suppose the system is       <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/NovanIV" rel="nofollow">NovanIV</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Roll a d20 and try to roll over the target number.  The target number starts at 10.  Every time you succeed, increase it by 1, and every time you fail, decrease it by 1</p></div></blockquote>\nWhat behavior do we expect? Well, variance is high, because even at (say) 75% chance of success you'll sometimes have streaks of failure. So it'll probably oscillate assuming there's a good proportional negative feedback going on. Which there should be, because the higher your TN, the more likely you fail, the more likely your TN decreases. There's no <i>obvious</i> static target, since we adjust by the same amount on success and failure rather than, say, proportional to how far the current TN is from 10 or something, but the <i>expected adjustment</i> each roll should look like "something proportional to TN's distance from 10, or 9, or 11 maybe, but in the opposite direction". How much do we adjust TN by each roll? +1 on success, -1 on failure, but probability of success and failure is different based on TN... if our current TN is 10+D, in expectation we adjust by +1*success_prob + -1*failure_prob = +1*[(20-(10+D))/20] + -1*[(10+D)/20] = (20-10-D-10-D)/20 = -D/10.<br/><br/>So it's on average proportional to -(TN-10) or in other words the distance the TN is from 10. That makes sense, as rolling over TN 10 with a d20 is breakeven probability 50%. It means that the TN should keep coming back to be around 10.<br/><br/>What else will it do? The adjustment is memoryless, so whenever your TN becomes 10 you have equal chance of going in either direction, which is streaky, so while sometimes you'll see a nice "I had good luck, now I have bad" or vice versa, just as often you'll see "I had good luck, came back to normal, now I have good luck again". It kind-of oscillates, but towards and away from neutral rather than to "good luck" versus "bad luck".<br/><br/>Maybe giving the adjustment a bit of lag/memory would help?\n<blockquote>Bag starts with 2 past-success tokens and 2 past-failure tokens. TN starts at 10. Try to roll over TN with a d20 to succeed. On a success, add a past-success token to your bag. On a failure, a past-failure token. Then draw a token at random. If it's a past-success token, increase TN by 3. If it's a past-failure token, decrease TN by 3.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464250/#Comment_464250" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-23T01:44:51+00:00" title="June 23, 2017  1:44AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This isn't *quite* a feedback loop, but still an interesting example of a counter-intuitive approach to something:<br/><br/>Greg Porter's EABA system does something like Cthulhu Dark for injuries:<br/><br/>When you get hurt, you record a number of wounds (or hit points - I don't remember what they're called).
