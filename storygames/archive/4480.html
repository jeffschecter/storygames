Nearly to the finish of it, really.  And it's infected my brain.<br/><br/>The "Mood" and "Trust" mechanic, by which you cultivate the affections of your four female party members to determine which (if any) becomes your lifelong friend in the game's ending, reminded me a great deal of some story games.  Most notably, <i>The Mountain Witch</i> and <i>Bliss Stage</i>.<br/><br/>So I'm thinking: <i>action-adventure harem anime story game??</i><br/><br/>It'd be a disturbingly easy kitbash, if you wanted to do it that way.  Mash together the abovementioned Trust mechanics (each scene, you can improve or damage the girls' Moods, translating into a shift in Affection at the end of the chapter), stir it up with some <i>Primetime Adventures</i> style Screen Presence and/or Issues (every girl has a Problem that will come to a head at some point in the story--will our hero prove himself capable, or bungle it?), top it off with "Confessionals" from <i>Inspectres</i> (so we get the gals' inner thoughts) and a <i>My Life with Master</i> or <i>Contenders</i> style epilogue constrained by the different Affection ratings--could be excellent fun!  So long as you had players willing to run with the different roles and play them to the hilt...<br/><br/>Of course, building something from the ground up would be better, but I've never designed a game ever. Unless you count a weird fantasy-cyberpunk thing called "Legacy 2000" I did in grade school.  Plus I haven't watched anime in ages unless you count <i>Avatar</i>, so I'd need some inspirational material.

The big obstacle I've faced is the structure - one protagonist, many supporting cast. The way I think I'd want to do it is to have the players control the supporting cast (the harem, in this case) and have the protagonist be a rules-construct/GM-character sort of like the Master in <i>My Life With Master</i>. The problem is that the supporting cast in these kind of stories doesn't really have much agency - and when they do, the story model tends to blow up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101474/#Comment_101474" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T22:56:10+00:00" title="October  6, 2007 10:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason: Thank you.  I think that was exactly what I needed to hear, ha!<br/><br/>Mark: Definitely caveats worth noting!  I envision a <i>Bliss Stage</i>-esque "you totally broke my Trust that scene" type procedure, so I'm not sure about having the protag be a rules construct--it's more fun to make another player squirm!  And yeah, the cloud of supporting characters need to be fun to play in their own right, so they ought to have more agency than perhaps the genre typically affords them.  Can you elaborate on what you mean by "the story model tends to blow up"?  I'm okay with jettisoning problematic parts of the genre or its standard arc, so long as the question of "who will he end up with?" stays central and fun.<br/><br/>Got myself a notebook for this thing.

(Or get the True Ending, in the harem model). You burn through the side stories en route to the resolution. If you want the supporting cast to remain interesting, protagonized, and worthwhile to play throughout the whole story arc, you probably need to get rid of that. When you do that, you're left with a drawn-out struggle for the protagonist's attention between the supporting cast.<br/><br/>See Nathan Russell's <i>Space Rat</i> for one take on how to make that into a fun game. 1km1kt <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Space_Rat.pdf" rel="nofollow">link</a> seems to be down right now, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102130/#Comment_102130" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T20:46:58+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  8:46PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 8:47PM by SabreCat.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "A drawn-out struggle for the protagonist's attention between the supporting cast" -- YES.
