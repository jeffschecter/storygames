Let me explain:<br/><br/>Weirdness is about the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14372&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">giant space squid</a> in framweard's post, pretty much. (Sorry about the link going to the whole thread--I can't seem to copy individual post anchors in Chrome.) I do like the way the Hot Seat rule kept people making individual decisions, but sometimes it took us to depths of weirdness that I don't think players particularly cared for. And for whatever reason our two space-themed games both had way too many characters like Legolas the Space Elf and his lover Arwen (huh?), plus space-mages and implacable enemies Gandalfus and Sarumas. It was funny, sure, but I didn't particularly like being trapped in that kind of trippy atmosphere without any way to push back.<br/><br/>Tiredness is basically creative block, where we had to create something on our turns but sometimes ran dry on ideas. We did come up with stuff because we had to, which is what the Hot Seat is for, but the stuff wasn't particularly good at times. Often these were tired cliches or crazy developments that made little sense, brought out for the sake of not slowing the game down. (The two games I played were both one-shots at cons, which contributed to the time crunch.) I found the process pretty fatiguing toward the end, both the part where I was trying to wring ideas with little inspiration, and the knowledge that the results were sometimes nonsensical and uninspiring. <br/><br/>I wasn't lying when I said I liked Microscope--a lot of the time the game did work, and took us to unexpected and interesting places. This post is about improving what I felt were the shortcomings of the experience for my new game, hence my focus on the negatives.<br/><br/>So here are the solutions that I want to run by the forum. Suggestions and comments are very much appreciated.<br/><br/><b>Techniques</b><br/><br/>Name lists: I probably should have done this for my con games, though the logistics were a bit tricky because I didn't know beforehand what we would be playing. Now that we're running a longer game, this is definitely do-able. If I see another Legolas or Gandalf in a non-Northern European-themed fantasy game, I will scream and probably quit the game. A list of names that fit the atmosphere would be a good start to prevent this.<br/><br/>Character scenes: I think the roots of the tiredness I mentioned above are in the lack of characters that the players know and care about. If the players were more invested in the characters, we could get more ideas about what these characters might do or how they might have shaped history. One way to do this would be to set up some core characters early on and maybe build some scenes around them.<br/><br/><b>Rules Modifications</b><br/><br/>Expanded Push: Making Push possible not only against perceptions in scenes but also against periods and events. (And yes, against names. Grar.) I don't want to turn Microscope into a full-blown collaboration game, but expanded Push would act as a safety net against free-fall weirdness. It might even cut down on player hesitation, since they know if their idea is hated it'll be Pushed against.<br/><br/>Mid-game palette modification: Making the palette changeable in the middle of the game, maybe at the beginning of a session. I think this would let the palette adapt better to the game.<br/><br/>So, good ideas? Bad ideas? Has anyone used these or other ideas to modify the way Microscope works? Do tell.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340285/#Comment_340285" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T04:57:12+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  4:57AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gandalfus and Sarumas? Seriously? If it feels like someone is actually mocking the fiction with jokey stuff, I don't think it's wrong to ask if they're taking the game seriously -- in any game, Microscope or otherwise.<br/><br/>You probably want to spend more time on game setup, nailing down what kind of history you want, tone-wise. The Palette is your friend -- use it aggressively if you want. Try something much more down to Earth. Zero out fantasy and sci fi entirely for a change, or restrict it massively.<br/><br/>I'm actually all-for brainstorming names. You can definitely ask for help coming up with good names if you're tapped. That happens in the play examples in the book.<br/><br/>I agree, more scenes = good. If you want more scenes, make more. Lead by example. In the teaching the game section, I recommend making a scene right off the bat. I suspect that people new to Microscope are drawn to the (unusual) power of making huge events and periods, leading them to overlook the relative ordinary choice of making a scene. I mean heck, you can play a scene in any game.<br/><br/>Also, try making the Focus very specific, like a person. That should generate more zoomed-in play. I'm surprised how often people make extremely broad focuses like "war" or "migration" even though the book recommends making them narrow.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eldir</cite>Expanded Push: Making Push possible not only against perceptions in scenes but also against periods and events.</blockquote>\n<br/>I'm against this, obviously. Like I said before, I think you'll get better results by spending more time agreeing about your intentions during setup. The games I've seen go badly are always ones where people actively dislike the history concept or allow things on the Palette they don't really like. That's the time to speak up. It happens particularly when people are teaching the game (even me) because they feel that as a good facilitator they should encourage the players' ideas, but they forget they're a player too and they have to participate in picking the concept or it won't be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340311/#Comment_340311" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T08:20:36+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  8:20AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've found that in face-to-face settings the Korean gamers I know can get a bit jokey. I think it's a nerve thing--they don't want to put themselves too much out there and risk being ridiculous. And then there are the active clowns; it was my fiance who first broke out with "Gandalfus" in an otherwise serious scene, and I wasn't sure how to challenge him though I did express my dislike of how he was treating the fiction. He is still unrepentant, and someday he will pay. *shakes fist*<br/><br/>There was also the fact that play time in previous games was limited to one session and everyone felt the need to end their turns quickly, which resulted in lots of top-of-the-head and cliched declarations both name-wise and story-wise. I hope the online setting and the longer time frame of the upcoming game will take a bit of the pressure off the players and help them focus on the game instead of on trying to be wise guys. <br/><br/>I hear you about the setup phase, when I probably should have been more outspoken about what I didn't like. I didn't like the idea of the damned space elves, but other players thought it would be fun and I didn't want to be the gaming grinch. Others probably toned down their opinions, too, for the sake of not arguing and not taking up too much time. We definitely need to spend a lot of time and thought on setup for this game.<br/><br/>I've always tried to be very specific with my Foci, starting with a character as you advised, and that worked pretty well though it didn't defend against the advent of Gandalfus. I'm thinking of tightening my first Focus even further in the upcoming game, like maybe "the wandering years of character X" or "the rivalry between X and Y." That would likely result in more character-focused play, and would be dramatic meat for players to sink their teeth into.<br/><br/>I'm also curious about the design choice of having Push for Scenes but not for Periods, Events, or dictated Scenes. The way I see it Periods, Events, and Scenes are all building blocks of the larger history, so Pushing against any of them would basically work along the same lines. Of course it's highly possible there's an angle I'm missing, so if you could be kind enough to elaborate your point of view to me that would be great. The designer's view will obviously carry huge weight when we discuss the rules as a group, so it would be very helpful to us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340312/#Comment_340312" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T08:23:49+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  8:23AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2011 8:24AM by Emily_Care.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are neat ideas. And I can see why you have doubts about them Ben. When I ran the game, a name book was available (at least once), but it was never consulted. <br/><br/>I've got a question about the Hot Seat that is pertinent to the issues of burn out and keeping on the same (less than wacko) same page. Here are two visions of how this plays out. I hope this is helpful, Eldir, to sorting out the issues you're dealing with. <br/><br/>1) There is a possible interpretation of the rules that would mean each person gives their idea (in form of Event, Period or Scene description et al), and then play moves on with no discussion except what is directed by the rules. For example with a Scene, the characters would be created, then chosen, and the play goes on to get into the shared thoughts of the characters--all without discussion, kibbitzing, brainstorming and general discourse by the players. <br/><br/>2) Each person gives their input for the Period, Event, Scene without discussion or suggestions from others. Then once that is written down and in play, everyone can feel free to chat and speculate and generally build on what's been outlined. The Scene play, Events and Periods are all informed by this interstitial discussion, and the next things are created and built on not just the bare words on the cards, but upon the shared understanding and realm of possibilities that have been discussed in between.<br/><br/>Now, 1 is what I feel like I should be doing when playing the game. 2 is what has happened at the table in the two times I've played. But the dynamic that the interstitial conversations created, I feel, cut way down on the creative burden felt by the players, and made it possible to both feel like you were not comletely out on a limb everytime it was your turn, and to help people communicate the tone of what they wanted to create together. <br/><br/>The Focus, Legacy, Scene structure, Pushes and E/P/S structure all create a framework within which a rich field of narrative can be created. Having the Hot Seat ideal for each turn keeps us from bogging down in naysaying and second thoughts. But the shared input on what was created also felt needed to help us all move from the bare details of a phrase or name, to a fully implied body of ideas and stories. <br/><br/>If it is intended to be played as scenario 1, I do mean to try it that way. And I have only played twice, so there is a lot of room for me to learn more about what the game can do, and how it does so. What I describe above came from my facilitating play and responding to the organic dynamic that arose among the players at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340397/#Comment_340397" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T19:53:32+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  7:53PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2011 7:54PM by Eldir.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the the book definitely supports interpretation 2) when it recommends taking a break after wrapping up a Focus to talk about the game, though not about what happens next. ("Next" being a qualified term for a game like Microscope, but you know what I mean.) I think when I played with my two groups, in addition to not spending enough time on setup, we played it too much like 1) though not by intention. Again, time crunch. Interstitial conversations to fill in the nuances and to get a feel of what excites the players would definitely have helped get the creative juices flowing, so I will make after-Focus and after-session discussions a formal rule this time around. I like how this discussion is giving me a better idea about the dynamics of games past, both good and bad!<br/><br/>(I am also mildly star-struck from having the designers of two of my favorite games responding in a thread.

It might be general appreciation ("ooh, I love that image of the giant ships descending in the middle of the battlefield!") or reintegrating known facts ("I was totally wondering why the captain was so mad in that other scene! It all makes sense now."). You can even point out unexplained gaps in the history ("well the empire is ruled by a hereditary monarch in this period, but we already know it's ruled by the theocrats in that later period, so that must change at some point...").<br/><br/>The important line not to cross is brainstorming ideas or suggesting what might be ("I'll bet the priests started a holy war and stole power from the emperor..." -- bzzt! foul!). Even when it seems harmless, it's a slippery slope. You can actually talk a lot at the table, so long as you don't create or hint. If someone does start to make things (in a moment of unbridled enthusiasm) we just politely remind them of the rules and tell them to save it for their turn. If you want chatter, it's important that everyone at the table knows that this is the boundary and agrees to stop each other when the line is crossed.<br/><br/>Same with talking while someone is create a Period or Event: you can launch whole Q&amp;A sessions to find out the details you need to get a clear picture. But just ask questions, don't make suggestions. The text on the cards is just a short summary of what gets said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340429/#Comment_340429" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T06:32:24+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  6:32AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>The important line not to cross is brainstorming ideas or suggesting what might be ("I'll bet the priests started a holy war and stole power from the emperor..." -- bzzt! foul!).

That is very tricky to navigate. This is a dynamic that comes up in Sign in Stranger as well. How to, gently, hold back people from extrapolating on what's been created? Where is the line between connecting what is known, with creating new ways it may unfold? <br/><br/>I think, in looking back, that there was a good amount of the extrapolation that happened between turns in the two games I played. When I play next, I'll explain that distinction more clearly, and ask everyone to hold the line, and see how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340517/#Comment_340517" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T17:04:27+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  5:04PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2011 5:05PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, you've got it Emily.

I haven't explained all the rules yet, but made sure to emphasize to players that chatter is permitted, just not on what to add to the game next. I'll keep making that point as play goes on, because I think one of the reasons for earlier games being weird/tiring at times was there wasn't enough chatter, both because of the time pressure and because I interpreted the "no suggestions" rule too expansively.<br/><br/>We have an interesting addition to the rules suggested by another player. For context, the campaign will be about rebuilding from an apocalypse, and in the course of making up the big picture there was some chatter about an King Arthur-style figure who holds back the tides of barbarism to creates order out of chaos. I love politics and warfare in fiction so I'm pretty excited about the prospect.<br/><br/>We decided easily enough on the start period ("The Burning Times" when civilization as we know it ends--but not by nuclear warfare, that's one of the No items on the palette), but had difficulty settling on an end period. We tossed around ideas such as humanity evolving into a higher species, becoming spiritually enlightened, or rebuilding civilization only to start the same thing over again, but none of these stuck. We all liked the post-apocalyptic Arthur and Camelot idea and wanted it to happen, but couldn't agree on where to go from "Camelot." And ending on the establishment of the first civilized country/city seemed a bit cramped, since that could take place just decades after the apocalypse.<br/><br/>Then a player suggested that we could set the building of "Camelot" as a <i>tentative</i> end period, then set a new end period if we all agreed the history could be expanded and we had a better idea of what to do after "Camelot." We all liked this idea, so we decided the end period would be "Establishment of the First Civilized State" (though that seems more like an event now that I think about it), with the option to expand the history by setting a new end period.<br/><br/>I also like the idea of starting with a fairly small history because we could focus on just a few generations, with the possibility of recurring characters that we could get to know and care about. And if we want to take it further, we can always grow the history later on.<br/><br/>I'm also considering adding "Blatantly derivative names" to the "No" list when we continue next week. This is surprisingly common in the games I've played, for some reason. Why do people do that, anyway?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
