<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=676&amp;page=1#Comment_15403" rel="nofollow">Over here</a> I started thinking that you could do something cool by drawing a distinction between two sorts of reasoning, one abductive and the other, well, creative.  I won't dwell on the distinction here (I think I did more than enough of that over there), but I wanted to toss out a sketch of how to apply that distinction to lay the groundwork for a sleuthing game.  I'll call it <i>No Shit, Sherlock</i> or NSS for short.  I'm not committed to creating said game, but seeing if the dramatic staging of a (philosophical) distinction looks like it could actually do something cool for a game.  Ergo, I put it here, in little ideas.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is simple: outwit the great Sherlock Holmes.  One player takes the role of Sherlock and creates the mystery--detemines the evidence and how they (Sherlock) will solve the mystery and reveal a criminal mastermind.  Their would need to be some good structure here.  They write these down on a series of cards which they can flip over (rules not determined, but it should be timed and cards should have placement indicating order to be dealt with) over the course of the game.  The other players compete with each other to get to the conclusion first, before Sherlock can flip over the cards.  <br/><br/>Each card flip should be framed in some way  by Sherlock--preferably drawing upon evidence that was simply unavailable to the other players (this puts the other players in the situation of a reader--who rarely sees all the evidence).  The other players makes one of two sorts of moves:<br/><br/>1. Hypothesis (i.e. abduction): They make a statement of how they think the card will result, if they are correct in their hypothesis, they get points and contest (undetermined rules) the Sherlock player's frame, possibly wresting claim of the evidence from them (scoring points that can be traded for die, tokens, etc.).  They co-opt the frame.<br/><br/>2. Supplementation (i.e. the creative, not abductive): The player makes a statement of what will be found and contests the Sherlock player to have their discovery be the 'real' discovery.  They contest the frame.<br/><br/>Now, the more pre-existing (already flipped) evidence you can rally to your supplement, the more likely you are to be victorious and claim the evidence.  However, if you get a hypothesis right, you get more points...which has the players competing with each other, too--once one player supplements a frame, the other players can contest them directly?<br/><br/>I see four basic sorts of moves you can make(Supplement = S, Hypothesis=H):<br/><br/>(NA)--Play the dunce (i.e. Watson): player utters ritual phrase about Holmes' unparalleled genius, granting their support to Sherlock in a contest.  If Sherlock wins, they get a (die, token, whatever) that they can use in a future contest with another player.<br/><br/>(S)--Play to banality (i.e. the Inspector): player utters ritual phrase that attributes the evidence to some entirely obvious sort of crime.  They contest Sherlock's attribution to a criminal genius and, if victorious, make it less likely that Sherlock's final revelation will be true (accumulate a die, token, etc.) that they can play in the final showdown against Sherlock.<br/><br/>(S)--Play to the mastermind (i.e. Moriarty): player utters ritual phrase that attributes Sherlock's deduction to what the mastermind wanted him to see.  If victorious, gains a (die, etc.) that they can play in a contest against another player or Sherlock, but which cannot be used in the showdown, revelation scene.<br/><br/>(H)--Play the rival (i.e. Mycroft): player utters ritual phrase and suggest that they have already understood the evidence.  They contest Sherlock and, if victorious, get several (dice, etc) that they can use in any sort of contest.<br/><br/>[Edit] Hmm, it could be especially interesting if the players could take these attitudes with each other--Play Watson to someone's Mycroft, for example.  Heck, play Watson in order solicit them into playing the Mycroft...<br/><br/>So, does this seem to make sense as both a possible game and as a successful 'staging' of the difference between Supplement and Hypothesis, Creation and Abduction?                </div>

<i>I like it, but it seems like an awful lot of work for the Sherlock Master, particularly since it's an "Everyone Against Me" game.</i><br/><br/>oh yeah--I'm thinking that Sherlock would have the prep of a pretty serious GM-driven game--which might make the Sherlock player even more serious about keeping their plans intact.<br/><br/>Still, I think for the game to work, there would need to be some pretty tight rules about formulating a mystery--something that makes the hypothesis option feasible and not just a crazy gamble for the player to guess it.  That is a pretty big [rules here] block right now.<br/><br/>Of course, I guess for a real intensive project, the game would be designed around pre-determined scenarios.  The Sherlock player reads them carefully while everyone else just reads the rules.  With good enough core scenarios, it would probably be pretty clear to an interested player how they would come up with scenarios of their own.<br/><br/><i>Can you lay out the way you see the four types of reasoning relating to the four character types you've set up?</i><br/><br/>Right now, I'm just using the character types to provide someone who knows the Sherlock literature with icons of the different moves.  So, no one ends up playing 'Watson' per se--more like 'pulling a Watson.'  <br/><br/>That being said, to make the step towards a more robust game, it would make solid sense for the types to be players, with each of them having pools of dice that they can apply in certain ways.  Each would get a pool for each type of move, accruing more by actually succeeding in them. <br/><br/>Something like: <br/><br/>Mycroft (Dunce: 0, Banality: 1, Mastermind: 2, Rival: 4)<br/>Watson (Dunce: 4, Banality 2, Mastermind: 1, Rival: 0)<br/>Inspector (Dunce: 2, Banality: 4, Mastermind: 0, Rival: 1)<br/>Criminal Psychologist (Dunce: 1, Banality: 0, Mastermind: 4, Rival: 2)<br/><br/>That means that taking the Mycroft role is sort of like taking the hotseat, challenging Sherlock to a head to head, whereas the Watson role puts you in a more diplomatic place, someone who can court other players with their support, even directing them with solicitations of support ('I'll play the dunce to the inspector's assertion of..." when the inspector may not have yet committed themselves to an assertion).<br/><br/>Hmmm....                        </div>

                            Hey Isbo,<br/><br/>I'd like to see an example of the sort of prep the Sherlock player would need to do.  Could you write up, say, the Hound of the Baskervilles in roughly play-ready form?  I realize the outcome and even the events could change based on game play, but I'm not really grasping the necessary prep.  I've actually been thinking about something sort of similar, except in my mind you wouldn't know who was taking which role until the game evolved.                        </div>
