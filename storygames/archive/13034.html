Yeah<br/>\n- But I am looking for a way to represent at a glance the state of a complex conflict that includes not only the where a confrontation is taking place, but what that conflict means for the various participants and Howard's simpler diagrams (like the U.N. in Bosnia or the jostling for position among the various factions involved in the Northern Irish peace agreements) crystallize it.<br/>\n- The chart looks complicated but every aspect of it can be a pretext for adding colour, working out interstitial scenes, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested in the representation of conflicts graphically for abstract intellectual reasons.<br/>\n(actually, not so abstract: I am a teacher and I am looking for a way to represent conflicts to those who<br/>\nlearn well with images).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have given up on using the fluid kinds of tabling of dynamic conflicts that Howard uses to examine fictions, and trying to set up very simple tables (4 column) to represent several kinds of politics-and-values laden confrontations (there are 6, according to Howard).<br/>\n<br/>\n"What doesn't jive when you play large-scale confrontations in (insert rpg name here)?"<br/>\n- I was inspired by military space opera so I wanted a game that focused on that<br/>\n- I wanted players to be making the kind of large scale decisions like the commanders of the Battlestar Galactica have to make<br/>\n- moreover, there is a certain kind of hero worship or "Great Man of History" theory at work in the sci-fi I read when I was younger and I wanted a game where players took on the roles of people like Paul Atredies or Donal from the Dorsai books<br/>\n- So I took a means for representing, simply and clearly, the multiple points of contention in contemporary conflicts.  I wanted players to be thinking like these commanders who have to make all of these considerations and to try to realize goals without resorting to total, no-holds barred conflict.  I can't think of a roleplaying game where you do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n"What problem do you wanna fix?"<br/>\n- Braunsteins were decided by referee fiat and I don't like that, but detailed military wargames become bogged down in minutiae and reflect only the Clausewitz zero-sum/total war/kill or be killed scenario and I don't like that<br/>\n- Neither war games or Braunsteins capture the heroic fiction (or anti-heroic) of space opera<br/>\n(the games made out of Heinlein's Starship Troopers don't really get down to the story of Johnny Rico and our species' becoming an interplanetary one)<br/>\n- I wanted a game where you could have an ongoing conflict between rivals where defeat in one battle didn't mean the end of the war<br/>\n(c'mon -- who wouldn't want to play the Cylon Commander opposing Adamah and the battlestar bunch, or be a recurring thorn in Picard's side, or be a Klandathu uber brain plotting how to put those hairless monkeys back in their place, or to be a Vaylen superbad space jellyfish overseeing 6 whole planets' enslavement by it's beloved spawn!)<br/>\n- I wanted to be a GM of a game where there was cool interplayer contestation and one where I could do a lot of improvising but not get bogged down in book keeping or just run things by fiat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296193/#Comment_296193" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-07T15:02:01+00:00" title="October  7, 2010  3:02PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks pretty fascinating but it could use a heaping helping of fluency play: that is, play elements getting introduced on at a time as a part of the overall play structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296197/#Comment_296197" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-07T16:31:10+00:00" title="October  7, 2010  4:31PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the card grid (6 players by 4 columns) can fit onto 2 8.5" by 11" pieces of paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM's prep does not lie in creating or printing out a grid: I will prepare six to represent the 6 basic dilemmas addressed by Howard: Deterence (0 sum), Threat, Positioning, Inducement, Trust, Cooperation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Threat Dilemma the Ref plays the voices of NPCs calling on the commanders to execute some action that goes against the characters' own beliefs.  The Ref is there to create complication and plays on the characters' beliefs and ambitions.  But in terms of managing the conflict, he creates fictional elements based on what the cards say.  All that fiction is designed to challenge the characters' beliefs.  The Ref is pumping up story elements, not being a dispassionate arbiter of kill ratios.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Courage75" title="Courage75"><img alt="Courage75" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Courage75">Courage75</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296206/#Comment_296206" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-07T18:36:26+00:00" title="October  7, 2010  6:36PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Erik, have you checked out Burning Empires?

And to watch veterans carry their ambitions and idiosyncracies and rivalries through a series of worlds.  Also, in the back of my head, is the evolutionary theme in the back of many space opera stories: what will we take from our history as we take to the stars and how will we adapt.<br/>\n<br/>\nSci-fi writers have had fun with setting what they though of as human nature against hypothetical alien natures and I wanted that fun in my game.  "Adaptations" is the general term I will use to cover genotypes, phenotypes, memotypes, as well as the group and individual strategies worked out by the players.  Such adaptations will be shared, stolen, adopted, forgotten in the process of the series of grand Confrontations that make up the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I wanted to pre-code that crunch in the manner of Solar System or TSoY but may have to go in the player-defined Aspects route of Fate)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted a short campaign length game with discrete episodes.
