                    Pretty self-explanatory.  I've always wondered about the "secret ingredient" that makes certain characters fascinating to play.<br/>
<br/>
* You can only name one character.<br/>
* Include the game.<br/>
* Explain (briefly) why the character is your favorite.<br/>
* "Because he was fun to play" is a tautology<br/>
<br/>
Like, I'm not enough of a theory-monger or design-monkey to contribute much to those kinds of threads, but I figure the data might be helpful.  <br/>

Arnold Littleworth<br/>
The Shadow of Yesterday (old skool 2004 version)<br/>
<br/>
Arnold was my favorite character because he was a petty-wizard who made a living as a con-man and quack, but dreamed of someday being able to use magic to improve peoples' lives.  He had this weird mixture of blustery showmanship, shame at himself, and professional pride.                </div>

<p>Harper<br/>
Amber home-brew PBeM</p>
<p>Harper was my favorite character because he combined blazing passion about the things he <strong>did</strong> care about with unshakeable apathy about the things he <strong>didn't</strong> care about.  When the GMs or the other players would roll in to say "Here's this thing that you totally have to find cool, and invest in," I always felt completely comfortable having Harper say "No I don't.  That sounds boring as shit.  I'm going over <em>here</em>, where I'm going to kidnap your fiance and perform magical medical experiments on him.  And then, of course, you'll try to hunt me down and kill me, because that's how you are.  Now <strong>that's</strong> entertainment."</p>

                            Bayushi Dorokan<br/>
<br/>
Legend of the Five Rings<br/>
<br/>
He died in a duel with his sister outside of a castle that was being laid seige to.  The GM was shocked and bereft, moreso even than me.  The group was just in shock but it somehow gave weight to every other duel in the game and was an important moment.<br/>
<br/>
The death was in the beginning of the campaign, things were just heating up.  Dorokan was a mover and a shaker; I really made the GM sweat with my politicking and maneuvering.<br/>
<br/>
Then...dead.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure why but I liked that his death caused such a reaction from everyone, myself included.                        </div>

                            Elektra<br/>Changeling MUSH<br/><br/>Anybody who knows me even slightly knows that I am a disturbingly huge fan of irony.  Elektra was a childling (a kid) redcap (monster) who was raised by a shadow court (evil) sidhe (noble), rebelled and then set herself loose on the world.  I played her on at least four different Changeling MUSHes, at different stages in her history, which means I got way the hell more authorial control over most MUSH characters, as I was able to "write in" what happened between games.  Elektra was totally built exploiting as many rules as possible, and was a holy fucking terror for anybody who dealt with her.  Playing her was always an experiment in seeing how much I could get away with -- and she got away with a <em>lot</em>.  Her volume knob was stuck at 11.  The thing of it was, though, that all her volume knobs were cranked up high.  Even when she was biting off gangbanger's hands or throwing cold iron dust into the noble freeholds' balefires, it was this four-foot high <em>kid</em> that was bringing down the high and mighty or making adults blanche and fear.<br/><br/>And her hair was fire.  Like Hades in Disney's Hercules movie, except I did it first, thankyouverymuch.                        </div>

                            Conrad Gallant, a scottish millionare whose parents were distant and cold, and galavanted across the globe. <br/>
<br/>
As a child he and his sister were the only real sources of affection for one another, he protected and look out for her in many ways. <br/>
<br/>
One fateful day his sister, hoping to  see her parents for her 7th birthday party for once put on her prettiest dress, and waited, and waited and waited. It was him, though who held her as she cried that night when no one came home and the servants attempts at merriment fell flat.  <br/>
<br/>
Two days later her gift arrived, a crystal Noah's Ark with sterling silver animal figurines. Amelia, Leo's Sister, smashed the ark in a fit of anger at her family and through the figurines out into the lawn. Hours later remorseful at the loss of the gift she and Conrad gathered up the silver figures. Save one. The male lion was missing and could not be found. Amelia simply smiled at her patient brother and said "That's ok you'll be my silver lion.." <br/>
<br/>
He remembered that day a decade and a half later when she was finishing up college in the states, their parents long dead, and he walked up to her flat to find it being ransacked by men in black who ran as he openned the door. He gave chase but wasn't fast enough. The police found no sign of his sister, nor did the FBI, and Conrad new, new deep down something fishy was going on with the whole investigation. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a repolished figurine, silver, worn by years of rain--a tiny sterling silver lion, and knew what he had to do.<br/>

                            Karl Vicente Ricardo ("Kavri") Tan-Yan-Doo<br/>
D&amp;D20 Modern<br/>
<br/>
Kavri was the son of my Shadowrun character, a Filipino-Chinese physical adept named Jose Tan-Yan-Doo. Jose didn't get much development. (In the game, we all played children of our Shadowrun characters. The system was mostly D20 Modern with some D&amp;D 3.5 thrown in.)<br/>
Kavri was also based on a character concept I'd come up with several years back and meant to write a story for. I never got around to it, but I toyed with the idea of making him in D&amp;D and experimenting with a Fighter-Druid combo. My GM let us use the Unearthed Arcana Gestalt classes, which let you basically advance in 2 classes at once, which made the concept more viable. He also let me throw in lycanthropy, which was part of the original character concept. I like experimenting with different kinds of characters, and Kavri was an interesting challenge.<br/>
<br/>
I had fun playing Kavri for several reasons. One was that my mental picture of him involved being outgoing and laid-back, which is not true of most of my characters. Also, I kept thinking of ideas that fit with the general concept but hadn't been fleshed out before. e.g. I decided midway that he's looking for a girl but is intimidated by girls who are too tall! (He is not tall. Filipino genes.) Then other background explanations got nailed down mid-play, like why he was a lycanthrope (artificial insemination baby; his two fathers didn't check on the mother well enough...) and why he tried not to show it. (his fathers didn't like being reminded of his birth mother!)<br/>
Also, the game had lots of fun tactical situations, and I got to use Kavri's various abilities to good effect.<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I'd like to add that for the game, I jettisoned whatever backstory I had. I only kept the core of the character--personality, ethics, abilities, looks.<br/>
<br/>
My GM actually told me that he really liked how Kavri turned out. He hasn't done that before.                        </div>

                            Martin De La O, aka Guerilla572<br/>
<br/>
Hunter: the Reckoning IC Forum, kinda PBP, kinda freeform<br/>
<br/>
Guerilla was the first character that I ever was able to bring through an entire story arc. He was a bartender in Albuquerque, saw some chick getting munched on by a vampire and was Imbued (turned into a Hunter) as a Defender (what it sounds like). Over the course of his 8 months or so of play (in real-time, kinda) he pursued a vendetta against the vampires in the city, has his hand ripped off for the trouble, had an identity crisis, changed from a Defender to a Martyr (again, what it sounds like), started getting more intense Edges (kewl powerz), gathered younger and less powerful Hunters to him, had to leave his family, home and everything he loved, had his other hand eaten by a werewolf, went into deep depression, came out, tried to rebuild his "crew," then watched them all die and took his own life in a futile effort to firebomb a vampire nightclub in Atlanta.<br/>
<br/>
He was satisfying, complicated, and really interesting. I was able to map my changes in mood and outlook to his experiences, but writ large. I got a ton of positive feedback from other players about him. I cried when I wrote his death-post.                        </div>

                            Zebedee James Johnson<br/>aka "ZJ," "Z-Dawg," and "StreetJarl"<br/><br/>Werewolf: the Apocalypse LARP (Mind's Eye Theater)<br/><br/>He began as a poor inner-city black kid just trying to do the right thing. When I stopped playing him four years later, he had become a fierce warrior, leader, and father.<br/><br/>Highlights of playing him:
<ul><li>learning by example to become a killer;</li><li>befriending a pathetic geek of a kidnapper who really just wanted a werewolf to bite him so that he could be one too;</li><li>adopting an inner-city street gang lifestyle as the only human environment that would accept him anymore;</li><li>falling in love with another young Garou and fathering a Metis child who died after four agonizing weeks;</li><li>countless clashes of wills with other Garou, culminating in his rise to Alpha of the Sept;</li><li>almost being killed by a powerful enemy, and waking up to the loss of his left eye;</li><li>finding a healthier (yet tempestuous) love with a Kinfolk woman, having a daughter; and</li><li>Being captured by the risen zombie of a police officer he had killed, who held him in Attica State Prison for months before his rescue.</li></ul>
Why was he so much fun?
<ul><li>Mostly, pure escapism. Where I am rational, he was driven by passion. Where I am a wimp, he was a tough guy. Where I am intelligent, he was dumb as a brick (and all the more lovable for it).<br/></li><li>The soap opera of relationships in a long-running LARP remains one of my favorite reasons to use the form. I've never before or since played out a romance in-game, let alone two. Add in the rivals, mentors, friends, charges -- it was remarkable.<br/></li><li>Empathy. I'm a middle-class white guy. Pretending to be an inner-city black kid got me reading about real-life race and poverty issues.

She was a rogue, and a really bad-ass one, too, with no morals to shake a stick at.  She embezzled 100 platinum pieces from the party successfully, killed dire spiders single-handedly, was sleeping with one of the other PC's (and he was an ex-pirate, so they both slept with a weapon under the pillow and each checked their belongings every morning to make sure the other hadn't stolen anything), killed an ex-PC, and generally got the party out of the trouble they'd gotten into by trying to "do good".  She's one of the longest-running characters I've had, and so I got to know her quite well.  :)  I'd still play her if I had the opportunity.<br/>

                            1st ed AD&amp;D<br/>
<br/>
This was during my first disenchantment with D&amp;D.  I had mostly stopped playing in favor of Champions and Traveller.  I wanted skills.  I wanted point buy.  But I had a friend who was trying to learn to be a GM, and he wanted to run D&amp;D.  He'd run a few short lived and disastrous games previously, but he was starting up again, with a limited set of players, all who I liked.  So I said, yeah, sure, I'll play D&amp;D.<br/>
<br/>
Only as usual for those days, I didn't want to play one of the standard characters.  I was reading "The Gateless Gate" at the time, and grooving on it, so I had this vision of a wandering Zen monk in my head.  Only he wasn't martial arts monk guy ala-AD&amp;D.  He was just a guy who wandered around and wanted people to just get along.  Plus AD&amp;D Monks were impossible to roll up at the time...<br/>
<br/>
So I rolled up a fighter.  And I said, he's just this big dumb farmboy that got sold a bill of philosophy by a wandering monk.  No, he doesn't know martial arts.  No, he doesn't have any kewl powerz.  So he made himself a staff, and went out into the world to spread the world.  I called him Joshu.<br/>
<br/>
He fought (when he had to), with a staff.  He never wore armor.  He never threw the first blow.  He hooked up with a Paladin of Bridget, and a couple other characters I no longer remember (I think there was a mage?).  He and the Paladin had long, loud, acrimonious debates about theology.  They explored a cave system full of kobolds.  He almost died fighting some sort of flightless raptor bird in the dark.  Against all odds, he survived first level.  The campaign lasted several months, and was a resounding success.<br/>
<br/>
I was still disenchanted with D&amp;D, but it was very freeing to realize that my character choices didn't HAVE to be dictated by what was "best" under the rules.                        </div>

                            Hmm - I'm surprised at this: I figured more common factors would emerge.  Summarizing several posts, it sounds like the ideal character is one with super-powered bad-assery but enough complexity under the skin to show growth and inner conflict.<br/>

But the character I posted about (Mugwump, a goblin rogue/oddball) fits the "enough complexity under the skin" part but not really the "superpower" part, as he's pretty ineffectual in most things.  mainly, he creates prblems for the rest of the party, rather than solving problems.  which is a lot of fun for me and the other players.  The GM/system seems sure that the way to reward me in playing Mugwump is to give him superpowers, which doesn't ever work quite right.                        </div>

                            Orzo.<br/>
<br/>
Orzo came out of a Alain Lapalme's fantasy game--some of you might remember Alain from rec.games.frp.advocacy.  It was loosely FUDGE-based, but mostly systemless.  Alain liked diceless decision making.<br/>
<br/>
Orzo had an epic story; he was a minor noble who found himself as the frontman for a guerilla movement behind enemy lines.  He saw his dreams of victory fulfilled and was rewarded handsomely, but he turned out to be an inept peacetime administrator, and everything came crashing down around him.  He blamed everyone else for his trouble and wound up casting his lot with a bigtime wizard who needed a loyal heavy.  He went from being highly self-actualized to a total henchman.  (which was actually really liberating end for him; it was nice not to be giving orders.)  <br/>
<br/>
I loved every minute of Orzo's story.  I was never immersed in anyone like I was immersed in him, and our playing group was really patient with all the spotlight time he commanded.                        </div>

<br/>
That's his Bubasti name, i.e., he was an Abyssinian werecat, born and raised in Egypt but sent to the States on a mission to find an Elder Setite's hearts that was stored somewhere in a secret vault. He was based on Werewolf: Bastet, but I played him in freeform forums using the rules merely as guidelines and Color. <br/>
<br/>
He was mostly a wreck, but one who tried to do things right for a change. He had left his mission path and had become addicted to self-indulgent pleasure and drugs (as much as a werecreature can be addicted), and was generally worn down. He had a lot of charm, though, but even that got him into trouble, as he had an affair with the local Garou pack leader's mate. He was also involved with a Mage, which was a mistake; she manipulated him and eventually led him into a position of opposing virtually everyone else. In the end, standing over the dead body of his only friend, he decided to off himself rather than get taken by the incoming hordes of vampires and Wyrm creatures (each one played by a different player, and with their own reasons to take him out).<br/>
<br/>
I liked having a guy who was a dark hero/anti-hero figure who was constantly struggling to balance his goal to do the right thing with his desires and animalistic needs. He was a good guy at times, a bad guy at others. Yeah, I think you could call him complex (though he wasn't a total asskicker; any of the Garou could have easily killed him in a direct fight).<br/>
<br/>
[EDIT: Took out second character after remembering the rules :)]<br/>

                            Funny, I couldn't think of a single <em>player</em> character, but then I realized that  wasn't a requirement.  So:<br/><br/>Benjamin Lowden<br/>"The Resolvers", an electro-punk homebrew using FUDGE and taking place from 1911-1917.<br/><br/>Lowden was a pompous and self-assured academic, writing a <a href="http://elcid.oit.unc.edu/mars/docs.php?id=3#1" rel="nofollow">book</a> in the present day about the player character's activities through the lens of a historian.  His chapters were my post-game write-ups, but Lowden had a clear and vocal dislike for the Resolvers and that came through in his prose.  He invariably sided with their enemies and derided their efforts.  My players eagerly awaited his every misguided, poorly researched installment.  "I can't imagine what Lowden's going to do with <em>this</em> one" was a common refrain as the group got in one scrape after another.  Over time, and through his writing, he really became a fun part of the story.                        </div>

                            This is a hard one, as I tend not to continue playing characters I don't enjoy playing. I'll go with:<br/>
<br/>
Theodore Carver (aka Brother Carver)<br/>
<br/>
Wraith: The Oblivion LARP<br/>
<br/>
In life, Carver was a drug addict who espoused a new New Age philosophy every time he woke up. In death, he's a jaded, self-appointed, would-be messiah. He's an experience junkie who has seen it all. He's come up against some of the largest antagonists in the setting and sees himself as having come away unscathed (though he's wrong about that last bit). Now he's setting his own personal challenges, both for himself and others (whether they like it or not, as long as he thinks it is what they need).<br/>
<br/>
He's engaged with the setting and its assumptions to a greater degree than any character I've ever played. <br/>
<br/>
He's examining and challenging what it means to be a wraith. He plays paternalistic mindgames. He's changing assumptions about good and evil. <br/>
<br/>
...and, when I don't feel up to roleplaying that sort of intensity, he has a built-in pressure gauge. He can have one of his infrequent flashbacks to his life and seem very confused for a bit.                        </div>
