The last few years are sales from the IPR booth.  If they had any sales at Gen Con in 2010 at the booth, they weren't called out in their sales data.  I suspect, they had none.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Green Spikes labeled 3rd Party sales were a series of informal arrangements I had with a number of different parties who repped Uni completely on their own initiative.  I'd sell multiple copies at 1/2 cover and they'd keep the revenue.  Luke Crane did this for awhile with what eventually morphed into IPR.  Eero did a good volume through Arkenstone, but there were a number of other fans who were just so excited about the game that they'd buy 3-6 copies to take with them to a local con near them.  For awhile I was selling 1ed pretty regularly to a guy who worked in the purchasing department of a South African bookstore.  He restocked about 3 times before leaving that job.  It was a pretty effective arrangement all around.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see the hey dey of Universalis came to an end in mid 2008.  That this cooincided with the demise of Key20 is no real surprise.  About 6 months earlier I had also ended nearly all active effort to promote the game on discussion forums or conventions.  As an investment manager by trade 2008 became a rather busy time for me, some of you may recall a little dip in the markets around then that distracted me from important things like Ramshead.  As that was about 2 years after the release of Revised and 6 years after the original release, I'd say it had a pretty good run.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven so it held on to some respectable numbers for another full year.  From about mid 2009 through today (3rd quarter 2010) those numbers have about all dried up with monthly sales in the low single digits and for the first time 3 months in a row without a single retailer reorder.  IPR reports only 23 units left in stock (as of 10/13/10) I take it as a good sign that that matches my own inventory numbers.  Other than a handful of copies I've kept for myself, that's the end of the 3rd print run, a total of 1850 copies printed between the 3.  Call it the low 1700s of actual sales (vs lost or comped copies).<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the trickle of sales now, I don't really see where its economically viable to do another run.  I'd love to release the game as a PDF, there's been some clamouring for that, and that would be a great way to keep it available.  I'd like to do something more than just take the old print file and offer it for sale, but with no pdf skills of my own I'd need someone to pull that together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho knows how long it will take to sell out those last 23 copies, but this seems like pretty close to the complete Uni sales history from 2002.  A long and crazy ride.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296772/#Comment_296772" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-13T20:14:07+00:00" title="October 13, 2010  8:14PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know nothing of publishing, but it looks to me to have been a very successful run.

Link from the Ramshead site and any others you can (The Forge).<br>* PDF download - Same arguments as POD, really (and offer a combo, why not?).<br>* Revise - You have a TON of Gimmicks and Add-Ons and probably some tighter play advise in various forum postings over the years: get that stuff into your existing source files (even as "mere" appendices) and re-release (POD, short-run, whatever you can afford or are willing to risk).<br>* Library of Congress - Might already be registered/submitted/whatever, but if not, it would at least provide a historical record. No, I'm not joking.<br>* Open - I am not enamored as much of this, because I believe in reward for work. BUT, if you really find you're going to sunset it, then consider putting it into a wiki (there's probably a fairly low-effort way to "chunk" the sections into wiki pages, with some kind of export). Open the wiki to registration (but lock the original pages) and let the community run with it, vis a vis Gimmicks, Components, and so-forth. Put a Donations button on the side navigation panel and at least maybe get a trickle of beer money coming in through PayPal.<br>* Cash out - This one might be the dumbest or the most genius: Shop it to top tier publishers, with your sales and AP information to back it up, and let someone with the resources to really market it and push it into the "mainstream" run with it. Go for royalties over a flat deal, obviously.<br>* Hire out - Not as extreme as the above, but maybe getting someone to handle the marketing and distribution parts, ideally for a percentage (i.e. commission), could keep the sales ticking along without a lot of convention-going and forum promotion and support from you. Is that not, after all, what other universal systems have done between major revisions (HERO)? Coupled with the "Bloom" idea below, this could build into a product line with loyalty and longevity beyond a single decade (HERO has gone on for how many decades, with one writer driving the bus?).<br>* Bloom - You have a "metasystem" in Universalis; perhaps you could use it to build more-focused products, within particular genres and settings (i.e. sets of ready-made Components and particular Add-Ons "toggled on"), and use the Challenge and resource systems as a common mechanic to bridge them all (similar to all the "hacks" made for DitV and IaWA, just by "reskinning," if they were fully bloomed into complete game books; VERY much like HERO).<br><br>Given time enough and beer, I might be able to come up with some other "sunset strategies" for Universalis, but the above are the most obvious to me.<br><br>I'd be quite sad to see a game I so respect relegated to eBay rarity and grognard obscurity. <img alt=":'(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/cry.png" title=":'("/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296915/#Comment_296915" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T14:20:36+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  2:20PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>Sorcerer was interesting, but Universalis is how I knew I found what I'd been looking for at length when I bumped into The Forge at GenCon '03 (or maybe '02?).</blockquote>\n'02 was in Milwaukee.

But I, for one, (and Vincent Baker, for another one of which I am aware) would consider game sales revenue in the same way that I would consider other professional writing revenue: by the hour (or by the word which can be reduced to by the hour, by considering average words per hour). But being an independent publisher of a single product can blur those lines, I'm sure--a publishing house consider profits per unit against promotion and fulfillment costs, while an author looks at initial payment for services rendered and--IF LUCKY--long-tail income from royalties.<br/><br/>(God...
