After reading <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=337" rel="nofollow">this post</a> that Vincent put up on his blog, I got hit with the "awesome, I need to play this, and I need to make it for this to happen". I've got some fun ideas about oracles and other things <a href="http://jessecoombs.livejournal.com/142475.html" rel="nofollow">which I posted here</a>. <br/><br/>What I've discovered, though, is that the consequences of Injury, Exhausted, and even Shamed don't really "feel" right. For the time being I'm going with Scared or Frightened (reduces For Others, For Myself) and Beat-up or Defeated (reduces Directly, With Love). This leaves Covertly and With Violence untouched, aside from negotiation. Also, this "feels" right to me, but I don't know how well this will work in play.<br/><br/>My question is, what do you think?

That feels right.<br/><br/>I like "Terrified" and "Beat-up", but I would switch around what they hurt.<br/><br/>Terrified would (in my mind) hurt my ability to act For Others or With Love.  Being scared should certainly not reduce my ability to act in selfish self-preservation -- honestly, fear is the main <i>motivator</i> for self-preservation. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Conversely, fear in a protagonist often interferes with their ability to help others or their loves.<br/><br/>That leaves "Beat-up" harming Directly and For Myself.  That also feels right to me, in terms of bruises and wounds such interfering with basic actions and self-defense.<br/><br/>... but I can totally see a scared,  beat-up guy suddenly lurching out of the shadows and beating another guy bloody with a hunk of rebar.<br/><br/>My two cents.

How do the characters start...how do the characters end.  When the final moment of the climax is reached...what is it that powers the hero through.  For instance in Die Hard theres all kinds of Covertly and Directly with Violence and For Myself going on.  But what finally wins the day is For Others With Love.  Thus in a Die Hard Hack it would probably be For Others With Love that I'd privilege as being untouchable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about for Batman?  I won't claim to be a Batman fanatic myself, but in the stories that I am familiar with Batman seems to start out all Covert and Violent...dropping from the roof tops at night to lay the vigilante beat down on some thugs.  But by the end of the story theres not so much sneaking and more desperation than violent beat downs.  My first impulse would be to privilege Directly and For Others in a Batman tale.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The "Dump Stat" approach.  One of the great things about IaWA is that the whole feel is to be wicked: to be sneaky and cruel, or barbarous and cruel...to be savage...to be Wicked.  "With Love" then becomes something of a dump stat...a "My guy would never act 'with love'" kind of thing.  Which makes "With Love" being privileged in the damage rules a thing of beauty.  What would a "dump stat" in Batman look like?  I don't know how you envision the players interacting, but if its like a Batman story more than one of them are probably playing the over-the-top villains.  Batman villains typically have sneaky master plans (so covertly isn't a dump stat), they're all about themselves and like to blow things up (so with violence and for myself aren't dump stats).  But that again leaves Directly and For Others as good candidates.  I'd say With Love would make a good candidate too, but that's shading more into Superman territory than Batman.  Batman always gets the short end of the love stick so taking damage to With Love is totally appropriate in Gotham City.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a Superman story... I'd privilege Directly and With Love because while Superman always STARTS doing things for others, in the end it always comes back to Lois...and I've never seen the Man of Steel not deal with badguys very directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a Spiderman story... I'd privilege For Others With Love because ultimately for Spidey its all about With Great Power comes Great Responsibility and MJ.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an X-Men story...I might privilege For Others if I wanted to emphasize how at the end the team always comes together...but I also might privilege For Myself, because the X-Men team always has those personality conflicts and the whole Mutants vs. Humans story lines highlights a more self centered take on heroism.  I probably would privilege violence in an X-Men story...at least one modeling the movies, because the end of X-Men is always about the big budget fireworks display and lots of collateral damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hulk...With violence, With Love...that's probably self explanatory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know.  Those are my thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149678/#Comment_149678" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T11:27:29+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 11:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Can we do Adam West batman, please?</blockquote>\nNo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149837/#Comment_149837" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T16:27:59+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  4:27PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Can we do Adam West batman, please?</blockquote>\nNo.<br><br>Heh, you would simply not pick the Camp Batman oracle, then.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149844/#Comment_149844" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T16:55:32+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  4:55PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, thanks for all the feedback!

A classic of the late 80s early 90s was when some street thug pulls a gun on Batman, actually gets the drop on him, and Batman says something like "YOU pulled a gun on ME?!?!" and proceeds to bitch slap the thug into unconciousness. Robin actually stops Bats. Was pretty intense.<br/><br/>When his will is broken in "The Cult" Batman goes all primal and actually attacks some cops. There are other instances of him loosing his cool. I can actually see that more readily than him becoming terrified.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150516/#Comment_150516" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T11:35:00+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 11:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can only think of two storylines where Batman was really terrified:  <i>Batman Gothic</i> and <i>Arkham Asylum:  a Serious House on Serious Earth</i>.

I want to keep to this as much as possible, but I'm wondering how this will work for all the many named characters in Gotham City and the DC universe. Should oracles say: "Three dead psychiatrists in one month, signs pointing to the Scarecrow" with Robin, Alfred, Gordon, Mr Freeze, Joker, etc actually being named, or like this: "A woman with the power to control plants teams up with a bitter rival"? Obviously I'm talking about Poison Ivy, but should I just name her?

The core oracles are written such that simply speaking them and writing them down in full automatically puts you in the right mind set.  Almost as important as the facts they convey is the style / tone they are written in that convey gallons of pure color and flavor...in reading them you're transported there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that's essential to effective oracle writing.  Don't use the entries to just convey facts...use them to convey Gotham...the way Tim Burton conveyed his vision of Gotham in the opening scene of the first movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo your first oracle might be:  "An office, well appointed, yet sterile.  Within, the body of a woman, hair prematurely gray, face starkly white, eyes open as if in fear.  The third dead psychiatrist this month."<br/>\n<br/>\nYour second might be:  "The docks at night.  A beam of light from the only working lamp slices through the murk.  Two thugs are speaking with a delicate seeming woman.  They are more afraid of her than she of them."<br/>\n<br/>\nIf each entry paints a scene that reads like how you'd describe a panel from the comic, I think you'll be happy with the result.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151468/#Comment_151468" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T13:04:31+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  1:04PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2008 1:06PM by Valamir.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For dealing with the iconic villains, I suggest creating a modification to the We Owe list.  Have a stable of villains on a seperate list...call it the Most Wanted list.  Any villain not on the real Owe list are automatically part of the Most Wanted list,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you're setting up a new chapter you can invent your own villains from the oracle descriptions, just like normal IaWA.  Or you can grab one off of the Most Wanted list (crossing them off in the process).  If that villain makes the We Owe list they can come back as normal.  If not, they go on the "Whereabouts Unknown" List.  They specifically can't come back uuntil:  1) all the other villains on the Most Wanted list have been selected, 2) a player crosses off 2 of their entries on the We Owe list to reach into the "Whereabouts Unknown" list.  3) Someone in the fiction actively seeks them out and finds them and they get added back to the Most Wanted list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr something like that.  That way you don't have to refer to specific villains in the oracles but still have the stable of icons to pull from.  For instance in the second example above someone could say "ooooh that woman is totally Poison Ivy" and someone else might say "and I bet those thugs work for Two Face" and those villains could be grabbed off of the Most Wanted list (or crossed off the We Owe list).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151492/#Comment_151492" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T13:56:45+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  1:56PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, <br><br>Thank you.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151498/#Comment_151498" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T14:02:16+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  2:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph...both ideas are awesome.<br><br>I need to crunch this around in my head a bit.

Its really nothing more than a stable of iconic villains that players can select from as part of the "what characters are implied in this oracle" step...e.g. "ohhhh...that doctor sounds like she died of fright...that smacks of the Scarecrow".  The "Whereabouts Unknown" list and the three numbered items was just my attempt to make sure the villains in the stable got rotated through rather than selecting the same one over and over...having the same villain show up repeatedly should still be a function of the We Owe list.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the Joker be the Joker...sure.  Alternatively you could have a Joker signify that the villains are operating together in an alliance ("The New Legion of Doom") instead of as individuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd originally called the list the Incarcertated List and then generified it on the theory that being arrested or sent to Arkham should be consequences of the fiction.  The "Currently not available to appear in this chapter" list seemed like too big a mouthful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't even use a "list" per se for the rest of the allied characters.  Gordon, O'Hara, Alfred...they're just furniture.  Someone COULD play them as a character once in a while, but not on a regular basis.  Robin and Batgirl I'd treat the same way as you're treating Batman...which I assume is just that Batman is an always available character automatically a part of every Chapter...but potentially just an NPC if no player elects to play him.  Some chapters some player might select Robin (or raven wing...or whatever other silly Robin version they came up with) and Batman is just an NPC...possibly with opposing best interests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152059/#Comment_152059" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T00:02:42+00:00" title="June 21, 2008 12:02AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gah!
