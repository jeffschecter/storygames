A bunch of rovers with complicated pasts and old connections meet up in a derelict hostel by the side of the half-melted highway.  And then you play out what ensues (sex and bullets, probably).  Something like that.  <br/><br/>But Fronts and the way they work are so very GM-centric, needing an "external" player to power them and make choices, even just to play them and give them life, distinct characterization, and the fictional positioning that sets up later moves.  Maybe you could have a single automated front that you generate actions and descriptions for using some kind of tables or card draws, as in Castle Ravenloft, etc. But that would be a hollow shell of a well-played front in standard AW.  Completely different experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349542/#Comment_349542" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T10:14:05+00:00" title="November 23, 2011 10:14AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The fundamentals of how the moves are structured are as a dialog between the MC and the Player. Even PvP works this way, with the MC mediating. AW play falls apart with a weak or passive MC that delegates too much the Players. AW really thrives with an authoritarian MC.<br/><br/>So, yeah, as much as I've been devoting my brainpower to this question, the very core of AW is constituted by the MC-Player relationship. Take away the MC and whatever it is that you have isn't AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349544/#Comment_349544" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T10:29:02+00:00" title="November 23, 2011 10:29AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me put it differently, then.<br/><br/>If you were to make a game that took AW's MC functions and distributed them among the group - how would that work?

But I think our standards for GM-less games and design have progressed far enough that simply distributing the MC's responsibilities among the players -- in addition to their normal player responsibilities -- should seem unsatisfying and shallow.  At the very least, we need to rework those responsibilities deeply into the things that the players are already called on to do.  Or, alternately, we might be called on to rethink the structure of the game so that having a MC-type role doesn't seem necessary in the first place. (Hmm, I think I'll start another topic about that, in general).<br/><br/>Really, where I would start are the core moves, structuring them so that they specify who-says-what about various results. Like, if the MC doesn't offer you a hard bargain or an ugly choice, how does that work? Does someone else offer you a bargain? Do you propose a deal that the other players choose to accept or not?  I think asking those kinds of questions would lead to some interesting design choices that you might then be able to roll into how NPCs get represented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349614/#Comment_349614" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-24T10:09:12+00:00" title="November 24, 2011 10:09AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once I tried making a GM-less game with fictional triggers. They were a bit like "moves", in that specific actions/events in the fiction would trigger events that affected the fiction; but the events were pre-scripted notes in envelopes. So envelopes would say "If someone tries to fix the boat", "If two characters argue", "If someone dreams" etc.<br/><br/>Maybe moves could be treated that way - as open triggers, that anyone can invoke. The first player to invoke a move is the arbiter of that move. So if A makes a move that B recognizes, B will call A on it; and if the move requires a hard bargain, B will be the one to describe it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349624/#Comment_349624" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-24T11:08:25+00:00" title="November 24, 2011 11:08AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Once I tried making a GM-less game with fictional triggers.</blockquote>\nI also tried using fictional triggers to take the place of jobs that are typically in a GM's hands in my Ronnies game <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2011/04/02/brick-mortar-last-of-the-independents/" rel="nofollow">Brick &amp; Mortar: Last of the Independents</a>. I used the survival horror genre so that nobody would need to play NPCs, and it let me use some genre tropes to guide play. The game has issues, but the part that worked were moves that introduced external tension. I gave different playbooks character-appropriate moves that would cause the player to introduce fiction:<br/><br/><b>Quiet! Did you hear that?</b>: Whenever people are engaging in unproductive bickering, mention the<br/>ominous thing you just noticed.<br/><b>What's that?</b>: When there's a lull, mention the ominous thing you just noticed.<br/><b>Hate to break it to you</b>: Whenever everything looks like it's sorted out, mention the ominous thing you<br/>just noticed.<br/><br/>(One big failing of the game is that the threats don't escalate on their own. I was trying to rely on the "describe your own failure" thing that a lot of comedy games use, since that tends to escalate the fictional situation, but that only works if people engage with the new content in a way that triggers their other moves gives them an opportunity to fail at a die roll).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349655/#Comment_349655" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-25T06:43:16+00:00" title="November 25, 2011  6:43AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that cooperative board games are a good source to look at for escalation independent of the players.

It's not a game you could make and hand to some newbie gamers and hope they get it.<br/><br/>Here's a question. Why GM-less?<br/>- nobody wants to GM?<br/>- more than one person wants to GM?<br/>- you don't like some of the things that the GM brings to the game?<br/><br/>Depending on the answer you're looking for a different solution...<br/><br/>If the answer is 'More than one person wants to GM' I think I've got a start...<br/>It wasn't Apocalypse World anymore, but I made some Star Trekky playbooks and played an AW-hack GM-less by:<br/>1) letting players create 'threats' - like, just the 'threat' part of fronts. Really more like the 'dangers' from danger patrol.<br/>2) giving different playbooks different kinds of narrative moves.  (Like, for Star Trekky, the communications officer played the aliens, the science officer described the world, the captain invented the mission...) This fit 'Star Trekky' a lot better than AW, but you could do something similar. The Hocus defines the Maelstrom, the Savvyhead defines the Apocalypse...<br/>For Czege compatibility, had a rule that you could never solve your own threat.<br/>More or less, people who weren't in the scene would GM for people who were.<br/><br/>And to stop it going gonzo, to Make Apocalypse World Real, I think you use your 'Try a Different Way' rule.<br/><br/>The Star Trekky thing was fun once, mostly because the people I played it with are all vets who can make a blank sheet of paper fun.<br/>There are definite improvements it could use...for example the threats got out of control in the end and we hand waved some of them away so the game would end, and it still has a kind of advancement system which should really be done away with altogether.<br/>But I've got too many other projects I'm into right now, so it's on the back-back-back burner.

I don't know what's stopping you.<br/><br/><b>But since you ask, here's how I'd do it:</b><br/>1. Setup: everyone makes a PC. Everyone gets a first session worksheet and as many front sheets as they want.<br/><br/>2. The conversation stands. There's still no turn taking, just the casual turn taking of any conversation.<br/><br/>Within the conversation, moment to moment, interaction to interaction, you'll be a player, an MC, a fellow player but not currently talking, a fellow MC but not currently talking, or pure audience. Don't try to formalize or keep track, they overlap and come and go.<br/><br/>3. The player agenda - play your character as though she were a real person - stands. That's your agenda with regard to your PC.<br/><br/>The MC agenda - make Apocalypse World seem real, make the characters' lives not boring, play to find out what happens - stands. That's your agenda with regard to everyone else's PCs.<br/><br/>4. A new co-MC agenda: share graciously. You aren't a solo MC; you've agreed to be enthusiastic about your fellow MCs' visions and ideas.<br/><br/>Divvy MC duties by fronts. You have your fronts that you're advancing, the other MCs have theirs. I own the water cult inside the holding, Em owns Dremmer and his raiders, Meg owns whatever it is that's going on in the old subway tunnels.<br/><br/>Coordinate fronts with your fellow MCs only when they really do interfere with one another. Ask first. "Hey, Meg, do you figure that what's going on in the old subway tunnels affects the water cult in any way? Anything I should know about that?" Since fronts in Apocalypse World aren't mystery- or backstory-intensive, this shouldn't be a problem.<br/><br/>Share the home front.<br/><br/>4. A new always-say (or rather, a never-say), for all co-MCs: don't have a conversation with yourself. Don't make the other players have conversations with themselves. <br/><br/>When you're playing your PC and you would normally turn to the MC for an answer, input, or to say what happens, instead turn to the rest of the group. Don't answer your own questions.<br/><br/>When someone turns to the rest of the group for input, one of you has to provide it. If you have something, say it!<br/><br/>When your PC comes with NPCs, have your fellow players play them, don't play them yourself. When someone else's PC comes with NPCs, play some of them.<br/><br/>5. The MC's principles and moves stand. They're how you relate to your own NPCs and to your fellow players' PCs.<br/><br/>6. The first session. You all know that the first session isn't a <i>session</i>, it's a process, right? You ask questions, begin to arrange relationships, play NPCs, look for stable and unstable situations in the PCs' lives, start to apply pressure to them, and ultimately create fronts and threats. Occasionally throughout play - especially as the PCs' interests grow in scale - you return to the first session process, to establish what's going on now, here at this new scale.<br/><br/>Each of you, as co-MCs, will go through this process at your own pace. By the end of the first session of play, at least one of you ought to be ready to start making fronts, but probably not all of you will be. That's fine!

Half the time the MC isn't describing, but asking someone else to describe, and that dynamic needn't change at all.<br/><br/>But then me personally, I'm very good at keeping half an eye out for MC opportunities while I'm playing my character. You personally might find that one role overwhelms the other for you, so that you can't MC while your character's on screen, or so that you find your PC becoming more and more an NPC over time. That happens.<br/><br/>This kind of co-MCing allows everyone to find their own personal, natural mix.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350099/#Comment_350099" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-30T20:21:03+00:00" title="November 30, 2011  8:21PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, great!<br/><br/>What about the heavier MC duties, like making hard moves, advancing threats, etc?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350102/#Comment_350102" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-30T21:12:06+00:00" title="November 30, 2011  9:12PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent,<br/><br/>do you think this recipe applies to just about any game or does it have AW specific dynamics?<br/>I loved IAWA and I see how it could apply there too - would you advise against it?<br/><br/>--i                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350129/#Comment_350129" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T08:27:07+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  8:27AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Paul:</b> Ah, yes, them too.<br/><br/>The rule about not having conversations with yourself means that when you're acting as your character, the other players act as your character's MC, and when you aren't acting as your character, you act as the other characters' MC. Hard moves, advancing fronts, making PC-NPC-PC triangles, the works. <br/><br/>If a scene is all about your character and her actions, you probably won't do much MCing in it (aside from the light duties). When a scene features your PC and another's, you have to look at the other PC both from the point of view of your character and from the point of view of an MC, at least to some extent. Like I say, every player is going to find their own workable mix there.<br/><br/>When you create your fronts, it's important to create fronts that focus on the other players' PCs, not your own.<br/><br/><b>Ivan:</b> If you can see how it would apply, and you want to give it a try, sure, go for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401596/#Comment_401596" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-23T10:08:47+00:00" title="December 23, 2012 10:08AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's interesting to go back and read <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> 's notes, after playing The Quiet Year. The projects in TQY work a bit like countdown clocks in AW, only they are out on the table where everyone can see them.<br/><br/>Plus, the chance cards in TQY really inform and drive the game in specific directions. Similarly to the cards in Archipelago or Itras By, but more directed. And a key of TQY is that it is driving play to a specific point in time, when the Frost Shepherds arrive at the end of the year. Having an end point is what makes GM-less games like Archipelago, Fiasco and Until We Sink really sing, since you don't have to fear going off the rails or not "doing" anything.<br/><br/>The Quiet Year also forces players to step back and play the community and not a specific character.<br/><br/>They are both very different games, but they are both post-apocalyptic and rather fun. I think it's informative to look at both, especially for hints on how to play AP without a MC. Has anyone actually tried a session of MC-full AP?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
