The nature of most action dispute systems in gaming is such that you pass/fail an action based upon a skill, attribute, or pool of resources that your character (or you as a player) has. It came up that in a very specific genre that a interpretation of this is an uncaring or unfeeling universe that doesn't care how much or little you want something or what the implications of the failure/success mean; you just pass because you're fast enough or fail because you weren't. <br/><br/>There are a lot of systems out there that don't claim to be set in an uncaring or unsympathetic universe, though. Few games actually take into account that it is easier for a good character to pass because they have good karma or the favor of a good god more so than an evil one. I have seen this attempted a few times, but it hardly ever works out in an equal opportunity for both the good and evil characters, in my experience. Has this been yours?<br/><br/>Are they inevitably set in an uncaring world due to the black and white nature of rules, least the game system itself be unfair toward one side?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423605/#Comment_423605" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-01T09:59:44+00:00" title="November  1, 2013  9:59AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about good and evil but I love games that are designed to be unfair.

Everyone gets (basically) the IAWA stats and a few deeds to start the session/sequence/adventure/arc/whatever.  So a "deed" is just like "for myself" and while you're holding onto that, you can spend it to do something significant for yourself.<br/><br/>* If you do something without a deed being involved, that's cool, it's off-the-cuff.<br/>* If you do a good deed, you hand that deed to the person it helps, and they then have it to use later.<br/>* If you do a bad deed, you discard it forever.<br/><br/>Good deeds always trump off-the-cuff deeds.  Bad deeds always trump good deeds.<br/><br/>It's not unfair exactly but it definitely enforces a particular narrative arc, in which the good guys get boned at first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423607/#Comment_423607" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-01T10:25:04+00:00" title="November  1, 2013 10:25AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I understand the premise here. Are we asking whether it is possible to have a game where good gods help good characters, without making the game mechanically biased towards good? Presumably this would be achieved without having equivalent evil gods as a counter-weight, and player characters may be good as well as evil, and the help of the good goods has some actual mechanical effect on play.<br/><br/>I dunno, seems like either the requirements are inherently contradictory, or there are plenty of games that do this thing. I'm probably not understanding the issue.<br/><br/>As for the thread title, I'm very much in for an "unfair" game, I suspect, although that'd again depend on what we understand by the term. Most of the games I play would be deemed deeply unfair by at least some other people, I suspect. Some games are unfair in that they treat PCs specially, either for or against them; others are unfair because they set players in no-win situations and demand them to make the best of it; yet others are unfair because some players do better than others, either randomly or by skill; and of course there are the games where a particular ideology, religion or civilization is disadvantaged against some other one.

If incompetence (or bad fortune) equates to deprotagonization, then it is a scary spiral.<br/><br/>MLwM is rigged towards certain outcomes, but if the players don't pursue those outcomes (like, if they keep being murderhobos because they never want to do the touchy-feely connection stuff) then they don't have the power to oppose the Master, and the game essentially never ends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave" title="SteveDave"><img alt="SteveDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/267/nLSFO0MJD2Z0T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave">SteveDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423829/#Comment_423829" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-06T09:34:43+00:00" title="November  6, 2013  9:34AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts exactly. If one is "happy" being a minion or likes that character as they are, the system is biased against the way they would like to play; which is how my game last week started with one of the minions. They liked being villainous and had no social connections to keep them from behaving morally, so they wanted to continue that path (it was the only one their characters knew after all).<br/><br/>This is in contrast to a system like Dogs in the Vineyard, where you can use your dice to do anything: good, bad, indifferent, stay the same, or transition the character. Your actions are equally likely to succeed or fail based upon your stats instead of your actions themselves.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
