Magic is fairly low-powered. No fireballs or anything flashy.<br/>\n2. I am imagining a year or three has passed since this happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout going into too much detail...My bit of a backstory is that some backwater program in the government has some documented experiences proving this but they have managed to be fairly suppressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom this event, the following has sprung up<br/>\n<br/>\n1. At some point, there would have to be some sort of leak, at least in the world of spying. A number of other governments are chewing over the details and are trying to play catchup. A few assassinations have taken place with a couple of them covered by the media. The target seem too low-placed in the hierarchy when compared to the trouble the assassins would have to go in order to succeed with their hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Conspiracy theorists refer to this as the Faustman events. It is the favorite topic of conversation for the moment. For every true fact, there are a 100 false ones. There is a slighter brisker trade in new age stuff, "cursed" artifacts, people claiming to be able to do magic. The tabloids show new pictures of demons and other monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Other smaller, weird events (such as bizzare murders, new gang symbols, and high profile thefts) start happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. At the same time, a few academic articles come out on ancient cultures and their religious practices. Scientists find a few people who have died of one-of-a-kind diseases. Animals are mauled but the claws/teeth marks really don't match anything known of really well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I am asking for is some help with other threads or areas of society that might be affected by such a discovery. I have some mundane topics set up about what the future is really like but I need a bit of help with introducing magic in such a way as to allow people to make discoveries.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way I am doing is to have the players be part of a consultant firm that hires out experts to crime labs and to cities where they cannot afford to have elaborate labs for their police departments. The firm has access to a few users of magic (which appear somewhat psychic abilties, sometimes like faith and other times, even stranger). They know a little bit from their own research but they don't know everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe firm would have several subsidaries, most of them boring like call centers, analyzing fund-raising potential for campaigns ran by non-profits, outsourcing for IT, that sort of thing. The PCs would of course work for the more exciting part of the firm. note = need a cool name for the company.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother classic route would be to just inject the PCs into some weird happening but I want to avoid the equivalent of the tavern scene at the beginning of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope this is enough to get thoughts thrown my way but I'll add more if it is needed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198984/#Comment_198984" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T17:39:37+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  5:39PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vatican would ban it and the population of Brazil would follow to boot.

Maybe some sort of smaller Vatican 2, take 2 happened but the subconscious fear is the increased activity of certain Islamic sects and increasing power of places like China.  Vatican, at first, will probably just make reminders about how magic is evil verses putting all of their efforts into witch hunts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could see some 3rd world countries start to conduct witch hunts to the dismay of the developed world.  I forgot to mention columnists disagreeing and a few scientists crying out against the wave of supersitition.  Most of them sit out, too concerned with their own stuff and thinking themselves above the fray.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the moment, I am imagining things such as augury, blessings, cursings, summoning and dismissal of demons, accelerated healing (not instant but people heal faster than science can explain), clairvoyance, clairaudience, having certain auras (more forceful personalities).  In addition, there will actually be cursed (evil) items as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll have to come back to that but I hope that gives an idea of what I am thinking about here.  People start bringing up different theories but I think a combination of instincts (that book over there sounds REALLY interesting) and self-teaching.   I say this because there aren't any real experts on the subject.  I have another style of magic called corruption which is more physical in nature but requires being tied to spirits and other dark powers.  For some reason, only the ones with the corruption skill know how to make any sort of permanent items.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, even the skill called magic won't be necessary be good, just neutral compared to evil.  I'll probably let people learn, at most, a handful of spells (i'll have a mechanic which states one spell learned per skill level (skill level capped at five). <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I'll come back to it in more detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
