Both sets, for some reason, are missing a d8, which is why the game doesn't use them.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somelady" title="somelady"><img alt="somelady" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somelady">somelady</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125489/#Comment_125489" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T06:00:47+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  6:00AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2008 6:27AM by somelady.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!  It's a little unclear if the dice outside the circle are supposed to be re-rolled between each story, or just at the beginning.<br/><br/>If it were me, I'd be a little concerned about coming up with so much stuff with only that much prompting, but you'd know better if that'd be the case with the lady in question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125513/#Comment_125513" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T08:42:30+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  8:42AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cute. <br/><br/>What does the questioner do? Reading this it looks to me like the Questioner is mostly passive. They may be allowed to choose the order of questions other than the first question (this isn't clear to me). They may ask extra questions to get more detail. But they can't seem to influence the stories, and I get the impression that the game would play out pretty much the same regardless of who the questioner was, and even if there was no questioner at all.<br/><br/>Also, who are the questioner and storyteller? Are they both dragons? Is one a dragon and the other a human? Two humans? Something else entirely?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
