There are more on the blog post.<br/><br/>HERE IS A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT THIS GAME IS ABOUT<br/><br/>The players are give a bad guy who starts the game by bragging about how evil they are. The players then make up how the bad guy has personally hurt them. The scene cards guide them through a series of plot points that should make an interesting story. 1. What is the bad guy up to now? 2. What is protecting the bad guy? (so the player know what they have to over come). 3. How can you overcome the bad guy's defenses? 4. Confront the bad guy and talk... Don't kill him yet! 5. Go medieval on the bad guy! 6. Who gets the final word? Wrap up the story.<br/><br/>The action cards fill in bits of the story that the player's creativity adds. The scene cards guide the over all story so the action cards can be used to add in color. <br/><br/><a href="http://hamsterpress.net/?attachment_id=497" rel="nofollow">The cover of the game.</a><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://hamsterpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FTAL-Cover.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405414/#Comment_405414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T17:29:12+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  5:29PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2013 6:21PM by MatrixGamer.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are a couple of characters.

The cards limit what you can do but those limits should help players be more creative because they have something to react to. <br/><br/>Each card give a number of victory points. I'm using them as a sort of token economy, the more interesting story elements give more points. My hope is that that will encourage players to do more than fight. <br/><br/><a href="http://hamsterpress.net/?attachment_id=508" rel="nofollow">I'm going to kill you!</a><br/><br/><a href="http://hamsterpress.net/?attachment_id=513" rel="nofollow">Capture</a><br/><br/><a href="http://hamsterpress.net/?attachment_id=502" rel="nofollow">Betray</a><br/><br/>Other players may suggest additions or changes but the active player does not have to accept them. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://hamsterpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Betray.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405416/#Comment_405416" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T17:42:32+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  5:42PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2013 6:23PM by MatrixGamer.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The players may also pick a scene card to inspire their turn. The scenes guide the players through story arch but don't tell what exactly happens in the game. I believe that players can take these somewhat generic plot lines and make their own unique story each time. The scene cards start off giving relatively few victory points but it goes exponentially up as the game progresses. My hope is that this will get the players mixing it up with challenges at the end of the game. Some dice roll offs then is very exciting.<br/><br/><a href="http://hamsterpress.net/?attachment_id=501" rel="nofollow">Scene Two - What protects the bad guy?</a><br/><br/><a href="http://hamsterpress.net/?attachment_id=505" rel="nofollow">Scene Five - The show down!</a><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://hamsterpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FTAL-Scene-2.jpg"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405417/#Comment_405417" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T17:50:42+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  5:50PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Each player gets one challenge per turn. Challenge can win you the active player's victory points but runs the risk of you actually increasing their victory points. A challenger plays an action card and adds to, changes. or completely re-writes the story. <br/><br/><a href="http://hamsterpress.net/?attachment_id=503" rel="nofollow">Bad Luck Action Card</a><br/><br/>The players both roll 2 6-sided dice. The player who rolls the highest wins the scene, re-roll ties.<br/><br/>Since challenges can reward the challenged player, and since winning a scene is essentially a 50/50 roll, players need to be careful in challenging. Frivolous challenges can lose you the game as much as win it for you. <br/><br/>My thinking is that if players make up a good story to begin with and accept additions players suggest, there will be relatively few challenges until the end of the game when player have to vie over who makes up what happens at the climax of the story. The victory point system encourages conflict at the end of the game but doesn't give much reward for it at the beginning of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405419/#Comment_405419" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T18:05:21+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  6:05PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2013 6:24PM by MatrixGamer.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game ends when the player resolve the last scene cards.
