That way you can set up an intimate or expansive play-space as necessary, and use the space for other purposes when a game's not on. The only trickier bit is to find tables that are both sufficiently sturdy and sufficiently stashable. Plus, the ideal gaming space, of course, which is a much more difficult issue than the furniture.<br/><br/>All that being said, I can see the utility in a custom gaming table. I'd probably build/customize it myself, though, to get it to my specs.

Two of them are worth four 4-person small tables. <br/>I personally prefer wider tables, but it's very convenient to open and close compared to assembling detachable legs and sturdier than camping tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465864/#Comment_465864" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-23T19:08:54+00:00" title="August 23, 2017  7:08PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2017 7:09PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually game at an IKEA table, so no shade, but consider investing in actual <a href="https://www.carolinagametables.com/" rel="nofollow">heirloom furniture-making craftsmanship</a>.

First is "Lack", a low coffee table perfect for living room gaming.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.ikea.com/fi/fi/images/products/lack-apupoyta-musta__22518_PE107397_S4.JPG"/><br/>One Lack fits say two roleplayers at most, so it's not very large. They're even and sturdy enough, though, so you can use several side by side to enlarge the table as appropriate. They're stackable, too. A friend of mine has a pile of them stacked in one corner of his humble living room, where they're easily available when gaming night rolls around. It's been field-proven to work well for OSR gaming - four or six make ample room.<br/><br/>My second recommendation is better for boardgames and such, where you need ordinary table height. The "Triangle" table has slightly flimsy legs due to its light-weight construction (as in, there's minor wobbling when you bump it), but it'll hold up as long as you don't want to dance on it.<br/><img alt="image" src="https://pixl.varagesale.com/http://s3.amazonaws.com/hopshop-image-store-production/37952929/b007440d6be297de1e6c238766453742.jpg?_ver=large_uploader_thumbnail&amp;w=640&amp;h=640&amp;fit=crop&amp;s=a2ddebc4a349ffb6acc247c84b70968e"/><br/>The main selling point of the table is that while its full size is square suited for a 4-player game (one player on each side), you can also fold it into a triangle-shaped half-table. In practice this means that if you have two in a modest apartment, you always have the choice of an intimate 4-player story game table, or you can extend the two into a long dinner table arrangement that fits a heavyweight gamer boardgame. I lived with just such an arrangement for a few years in Helsinki, and it was just about perfect for the premises.<br/><br/>The argument illustrated by these two tables is that while a big, heavy dinner table type solution has its advantages, many gamers may find that light, modular tables that get out of the way are more practical for them. I mean, I have quite a bit of room here in the country, and I <i>still</i> prefer tables that get out of the way, as that way you can use the media room as a gaming room without having the table in the way when you want to watch a movie.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/emarsk" rel="nofollow">emarsk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Maybe it would be more useful to share several designs to give to the local craftperson?

As I intimated above, I would be more inclined to build my own "perfect gaming table" if I wanted to get a big, beautiful flagship boondockle. Having ready-made design plans and ancillary ideas for it would be quite useful, whatever degree of customizations you wanted for it. With plans on paper it's much easier to get friends to help, too.

The problem is that most expandable tables expand along the long axis. This is not idea for board games, as the space it adds isn't always usable. I did finally find a medium-sized table that expands into a four-foot square. As a small table, it's perfect for a 4-person RPG or a game like Splendor. Expanded, it's big enough for a full game of Scythe.
