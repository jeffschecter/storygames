                    In one of the Geek Sociology threads, someone (I forget who!) said something smart: "There's a big difference between approaching something as a leisure activity, and approaching it as a hobby."<br/>
<br/>
Damn right.  (Was that you, Mark W.?  Because it definitely needed saying.)<br/>
<br/>
Here's the deal: if gaming is hobby, then I think it's hard to "draw new people in."  Hobbies attract people who are simply interested in the activity in its own right.  I do martial arts as a hobby (or, did) because I like that stuff for its own sake.  The chief appeal of the hobby, is doing the hobby.  And I suspect that most hobbies are very goofy to non-hobbyists, perhaps inherently so.  (Can you imagine a stamp-collecting message board, wondering how to attract fresh new blood to stamp-collecting?)<br/>
<br/>
If gaming's a leisure activity, I think the mindset changes.  The point of the leisure activity is to have fun; the "how" isn't usually very important.  (On a typical night, I might wonder if I want to watch a movie, read a book, or watch TV; it's usually a toss-up.)  If someone can be convinced that a role-playing game is a fun leisure activity, it's just one more thing to do, and it doesn't make a statement about you as a person.<br/>
<br/>
For me personally, I tend to approach games as a leisure activity, and I'm leery of the hobbyist aspects (collecting many books, mastering complex rules, playing for years on end).  Gaming stores, for example, creep me out a little bit because the hobbyist focus is so strong.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know where I'm going with this, but I think that mindset makes a difference to the experience of play, to design philosophies, and to the social role of gaming in peoples' lives and in society at large.<br/>
<br/>
(Sadly I'll be incommunicado for a day or two, but I think that's all I want to say anyway.)                </div>

                            Mmm...the problem is that gaming is a participatory activity, not a solo one. So, for a participatory hobby, the line blurs. You need other people to do it with. You don't need anyone else to collect stamps.                        </div>

                            I'd have to say, "All of the above."  Honestly, in my TSOY game, we've got both mindsets; some of us approach it from a more "hobby" mindset, in that we spend a lot of time outside of the game thinking about it, discussing it and other games, etc.  And some of us are more of the, "show up, play, have fun" mindset, but don't spend a lot of time getting all crunchy over it.  It doesn't seem to affect gameplay that much, except sometimes in terms of scheduling, since those who are more of a "hobbyist" mindset are probably more likely to specifically avoid scheduling conflicts and are more likely to definitely be into playing.                        </div>

                            It's a Leisurely Hobby for me, and heavier on the Leisure than anything else.  I'm interested in it for its own sake and can do the hobbyist thing with it (mastering complex rules, comparing/contrasting systems, knowing RPG trivia, etc.), but the bottom line is always going to be whether I can get together with friends and have fun playing a game.  If it wasn't a roleplaying game, it could just as easily be a board game or a video game or cards or darts or anything else.  It just so happens that in this case, it is roleplaying games, and they're pretty damn fun and not at all a bad way to spend an afternoon with people you like.<br><br><br>I haven't the slightest idea if that says anything about design philosophies or the social role of gaming or my experience of play, but then again, I really don't care.  That stuff is so far away from anything I'm remotely interested in that I'm not even sure I understand what the phrases actually mean. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </br></br></br></div>

                            For me game playing is a leisure activity.  It is one of several things I do with my crew.  Game design is a hobby that helps pay for small trips to visit friends around the county.  The illustration work I do is my passion.                        </div>

<p>When I think <em>"leisure"</em> I think <em>"without much effort"</em>.  Leisurely.  Calmly.  Without any care or worry.  A leisurely walk.  A leisurely bath.  None of which applies to how I approach RPGs.  I put a lot of work in to them and I expect a lot out in return.  So I suppose that gaming is a hobby for me.  Has been for quite a while.</p>
<p>It's definately a valuable distinction.  It's something that might even be worth while to openly discuss when talking about your most recent designs.  If I know that you want your game to be a casual leisure game then I can probably give better feedback than if I'm mistakenly assuming that it's a hobbiest's game.</p>
