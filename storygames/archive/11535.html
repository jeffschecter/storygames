For the life of us, we cannot find production artists.<br/><br/>A major part of the problem  is that Perpetual Motion Software - read 'my programmer, writer and musician friends who are interested in making video games with me' - is a start-up, with little to no capital. We really can't afford top-notch artists, at this point; we can pretty much only pay profit-shares over 10 years, in entertainment (through roleplaying games and anime/movie nights), and in dinner parties, and the last two is much easier with San Francisco East Bay locals.<br/><br/>Jasper, our musician is also an excellent 3-D CGI artist and cartoonist, and he's done some good character designs, but we badly need production artists, pixel artists, settings and backgrounds, and Graphical User Interface designs.<br/><br/>We <i>can't</i> pay in money up-front, at least not before the demo is out and we can ask for pre-orders.   We <i>can</i> pay in quarterly percentages of the profit over the course of 10 years, and in additional bennies (entertainment, food, equipment, referalls, unobtrusive ads) while working.<br/><br/>That isn't much, I know; frankly, I wouldn't quit your day job if you do this, because no one else on the team will, and a percentage point of 0 is still 0.<br/><br/>But if you'd be interested in doing this for the fun, for the exposure, for eventual profit and for what non-monetary benefits I can and will provide, respond or whisper in this thread with a link to an online portfolio.<br/><br/>I would prefer either western-style stuff in the mode of Sam Keith and the softer styles in Heavy Metal, or the very angular, harsh style of manga or manhua in works such as Death Note and Code Geass.  But at this point I'll take anything reasonably good that I can get.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257110/#Comment_257110" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T13:49:07+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  1:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "production, setting and backgroud artists" so this is not like comic book work, but more like animation, where some artists just do backgrounds or other very specific things or have to imitate the work of a lead artist, like mass production work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257122/#Comment_257122" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T15:13:37+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  3:13PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cedric P</cite>so this is not like comic book work, but more like animation, where some artists just do backgrounds or other very specific things or have to imitate the work of a lead artist, like mass production work?</blockquote>\nShort answer: A little of both.  <br/><br/>Long answer: Our scripting engine overlays a character image over a background image, making it far more efficient to have the character and background artists as separate people working in parallel.  And I'd also like the dream-world sequences - read Missions and combat - to be in a distinct style - less realistic, more impressionist, with pixel-art Nightmares, Pilots and mecha straight out of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr9jJlTSSeA" rel="nofollow">the flashbacks of a changeling from Final Fantasy.</a> <br/><br/>I would VERY much prefer that we have one person doing both the visual design and the displayable images of the characters, one person designing and creating both <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ORzz0jjX2g" rel="nofollow">both monsters and mecha pixel animations</a>, and one person on both Waking and Dreaming backgrounds, but if that's not possible, I'd prefer to get this done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257168/#Comment_257168" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-19T08:39:28+00:00" title="February 19, 2010  8:39AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2010 8:39AM by Cedric P.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so at the base you have to be a good pixel artist.
