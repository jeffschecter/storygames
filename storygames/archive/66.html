                    I have this weird itching to write something in the vein of computer rhythm games such as Gitaroo Man or Space Channel 5 -- a surreal reality where the natural escalation from an encounter between enemies isn't into combat, but into a dance battle.<br/>
<br/>
I have totally no idea how this could possibly work. I was thinking that once the scene of a conflict has been framed, play could shift into LARP for the actual dance-off, but that'd end up depending too much on player skill. But I really like the image of the players and monsters facing off across the living room with kicks and spins.<br/>
<br/>
Am I crazy?                </div>

                            Space Channel Five is great.  <br/><br/>I've also been thinking about tabletop games that center on performance - in my case, stage magic.  Like you, I'm not seeing how to make that central conceit gameable in an interesting way.  But I'm thinking on it.                        </div>

                            Hey dude, sounds interesting. And I'm a huge SC5 fan (did you know that M.J. does a cameo in SC5 Part 2?).  Here's some interesting random shit that may or may not help you:<br/><br/>* You're not alone.  I, too, thought of making "Bollywood d20", where insted of followers, at 9th level your warrior or leading man attracts backup dancers.  That's as far as I got with the idea after watching Asoka about one too many times (great flick).<br/><br/>* There's a Konami Game for the PS2 in Japan called "OZ", it'll probably be out in the US in a few months:<br/><a href="http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/oz/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/oz/</a><br/>Check this out:<br/><a href="http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/oz/b/p_m/play_m.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/oz/b/p_m/play_m.html</a><br/>There's two movies on the right side, check em out.<br/><br/>Why? Well, basically because Konami wanted to try out the DDR/Dance/Bemani stuff with an action game.  So the game plays out like Exalted meets Dance Dance Revolution.  The whole game revolves around controlling three main characters at once, and doing combos/juggling with them, using music/sound to judge combos and "kick the monster" over to the next character, so you end up making music while fighting, and trying to line it up with the background music. The result? Really weird, but very unique and cool.<br/><br/>So, even in the high-up world of video games they're thinking that.  So I think there's no problem with bringing it to the table.<br/><br/>It's nowhere near as exciting as actually getting up and dancing, but maybe you should explicitly have all combat or physical conflict be resolved with dance contests?  Most games have laundry lists for feats and specialties with swinging swords, spin attacks, inside attacks and the like, but why not just replace all that mess with dance moves?  Kick spin, handplant, capoeira jenga, etc? <br/><br/>I almost see The Riddle of Steel redone, with all its manuvers replaced with dance moves, and weapon styles replaced by dance styles: Club, hip hop, rave, liquid, fire-dancing, capoeira, white-boy in da club, street, krumping, be-bop, breaking, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I really can't see anything along the Tony Hawk line working as a table-top game, or even as LARP. It's just far too video-gamey.<br/>
<br/>
The real problem with this kind of thing is that you either end up with it being completely deterministic who wins, or dependent on player skill, both of which suck a bit, IMO. If only there were some way of introducing a random element; possibly a GM calling moves randomly, which the players have to perform. Different characters could have different move sets available. If the GM calls something which you can perform and your opponent cannot, you win the conflict (or gain a success which counts towards winning the conflict, or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
In a LARP situation, you could have conflict only possible when there's a beatbox handy. If not, you're limited to verbal sass in a Monkey Island insult style.                        </div>

                            We're really talking about emulating performance.  How do existing games handle that?  Usually the same way they handle social interaction, of which it is a sub-set.  Either it is waved off with a single roll or linked tests, or you have a conflict involving narration.  TSOY (for example) could happily handle a dance-off, but the burden falls on the players to be cool.  Since I'm not cool and don't know dance, my narration would suffer.  I've played enough Tony Hawk that I could spice up a skateboard-off, but I think the goal is to make the coolness organic inthe resolution system somehow.  And what about stage magic?  Think of the children.  I want it to be unspeakably awesome, but I don't want players faced with inventing magic tricks.                        </div>

                            In the case of Our Favorite Game that Involves a Twenty-Sider, they don't expect you to know how to fight.  Rather, they open up feats and skills and manuvers that are descriptive, can be gained through levels, and do the narrative description for you (or aid you).  Turn up the crank, and you've got TROS, which requires a bit of player skill, but so does d20: It's just that TROS requires a little more. <br/><br/>So, maybe a laundry list of dance moves (which will require a bit of research, because there's a LOT) with "+1 to this", "+2 to a Be-Bop combo" and a simple description of the move, etc will work.                        </div>

                            If we're talking about ripping off resolution systems, Dogs in the Vineyard's seems like a good model; the mechanics are there to lend structure to the exchange (in this case, of funky dance moves), and instead of traits you get special moves you can work in for extra dice. Problem is you probably end up with a lack of creativity ("um, I do some more spins and stuff") and also unless your players are all total dance geeks ("dude, there's no way you could step from X into Y without a beat in between") everyone can basically do all their moves every time, so it comes down to who has the most dice and how well they roll, for everything.<br/>
<br/>
I need a way to lend depth to the tactical considerations involved in a dance battle, which is tough 'cause I don't know anything about how it really works myself -- plus, I'm not sure said tactical considerations really exist; it may just be that the guy who's more skilled wins and that's it.                        </div>

                            There's certainly the opportunity to tailor your moves to your opponent's weaknesses; if you're opponent is hella good at say, spins, you try to steer the confrontation towards fancy footwork. Not 100% sure how this would work mechanically - maybe a system with different coloured dice representing different styles, with some sort of exchange rate mechanism whereby I could see someone's 8 at Breakdancing with 16 Flamenco, but then raise with some Capoeira that I knew he couldn't see? I don't know, maybe that would just involve too many dice.                        </div>

                            I'm suddenly mindful of the kung-fu rules from Sex &amp; Sorcery where all styles have the same basic moves, but what differentiates your style from the rest is how easily different moves flow into one another. The problem with <i>that</i> is that then your ability to defeat an opponent depends on how well you know his or her style, which devolves into bookkeeping.<br/>

                            This would put me in mind of BW combat scripting, except that I only know about it from reading about it. But if you script out some dance moves, and then the moves that your opponent busts constrains your next script (oh shit, I <i>can't</i> respond to a helicoptor with anything that doesn't have a Spin keyword) - I think that would be fun. And have some mechanic for high-risk, high-reward stuff to break out of those constaints (well, if i roll a 20 i can do the standing double-flip). Rockin.                        </div>

                            Yeah, BW Duel of Wits would work fine.  You're still relying on people doing cool things narratively.  Maybe that's not so bad, because you can always default to "uh, I dismiss" or, in this case, "uh, I moon-walk".                        </div>
