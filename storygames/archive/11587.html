"Tall guy, long legs.  I'd better try to get in close."<br/><br/>Then the fight begins.  The experience is one utterly devoid of pondering.  I make decisions, but they don't run through my head.  There's no "I should circle left now", I just circle left.  I respond to what I see -- his guard is low, I kick high.  I respond to what I recognize -- he kicks toward my head, I do a low spin, because that's what I've practiced and conditioned myself to do.<br/><br/>Momentum is big: <br/>It's hard to go from backpedalling directly to charging.  Sidestepping/circling is the key to not winding up backpedalling.  Untrained instincts say backpedal.  Trained instrincts say circle.  There's no thought, just physical response to "something's coming at me".  As for a charge, well, once you start, you don't stop, something has to stop you.<br/><br/>The first move is also big:<br/>We establish a distance on the edge of striking range.  We try to feint in order to get each other to throw a real attack as a counter -- if that comes, we're ready to counter it.  Or, we use a feint to get just close enough to follow it with a real attack, hoping that the opponent thinks the real attack is another feint.  Whoever first gets some momentum going goes into a charge.  Again, this process isn't thought through -- it's about having enough combat experience to recognize the difference between a feint and attack, and having the trained reflexes to move as soon as your eyes detect an attack.<br/><br/>Targets:<br/>In taekwon-do, the targets are the torso-protector and the head-protector.  All our fighting drills practice moves with those targets in mind, and all of our drills also practice defending those targets.  Between the two targets, I instinctively attack whichever one's less defended.  See opening, strike it.<br/><br/>Familiarity is big:<br/>If you're used to defending against front kicks, the first time you see an axe kick it'll probably nail you (because it starts out looking like a front kick, and your reflexes respond accordingly).<br/><br/>So, that stuff should influence priority <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  There's a ton of options taken, but they're taken by ingrained responses, based on recognition of situations previously experienced in fights and practice.  I'm not sure whether the ideal simulation of that is to have players making leisurely choices, enforced quick choices, or no choices at all during fights (but with prior choices in training coming into play).<br/><br/><b>Damage:</b><br/>Getting kicked can be disorienting, infuriating, painful, and/or scary.  Most of the things that take me out of a TKD match probably would not take me out of a life-or-death fight.  I have no experience with dropping from blood loss, shock, nerve damage, or knockout headshots.  These all seem like things that could happen in a real fight, though.<br/><br/>My EMT friend tells me that piercing injuries are largely a matter of luck.  A huge spike can somehow slide between vital organs, or a tiny shard can sever an artery.<br/><br/><b>Skills &amp; attributes:</b><br/>At low levels of skill, physicality is everything.  The bigger guy usually wins, though sometimes the faster guy wins.  At the highest levels of skill, timing and using the right moves is most of the fight, with strength and speed only being a big deal if the combatants are otherwise equally matched.  In-between levels have an in-between ratio.<br/><br/><b>Advancement:</b><br/>Some people appear to be "naturals" and learn timing and moves very quickly.  Other people appear to be "fighting challenged", and though their kicks get faster and straighter and more accurate over time, they never use them well enough to beat good fighters.<br/><br/><b>Training:</b><br/>There's breadth of response training -- how many moves can you recognize &amp; respond to?  There's quality of each trained response -- for a given opponent move you recognize &amp; respond to, how instantaneous is your recognition and how optimal is your response?  There's breadth of moves -- how many types of attack can you do, covering how many situations?  There's quality of each move -- how many boards (or ribs) can your side kick break?<br/><br/><b>Equipment:</b><br/>Getting kicked through a shirt is infinitely more damaging than getting kicked through a thick pad.  An inch of location deviation can make a big difference.<br/><br/>This should inform priority <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258358/#Comment_258358" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T00:44:05+00:00" title="February 25, 2010 12:44AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2010 1:00AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I put my EMT friend's injury information up <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/injury.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for reference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258393/#Comment_258393" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T06:17:44+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  6:17AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2010 6:18AM by jenskot.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I put my EMT friend's injury information up<a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/injury.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>for reference.</blockquote>\nThis is fantastic!

It seems the most "realistic" system would be something along the lines of: "Make a plan. What's your hoped-for outcome? What's your opponent's?"<br/><br/>If the fighters can see the confrontation coming, maybe have one roll of some kind for a "sizing up" or "reading the opponent" abstraction, so the GM knows how much to tell the player. "It looks like he's favouring his left leg as he comes in..."<br/><br/>Then some kind of simple mechanical comparison based on the two sides' skill levels that tells you how badly off they end up. At the extreme end is, "things go exactly how you hoped they would!" But that should be very rare, or a sign of incredible skill and experience. Really, you just want to know how hurt someone is at the end of the thing.<br/><br/>That seems to be how much real-life fights go: if you have any time to see it coming, you'll probably come up with a basic plan. That is, if you're experienced enough. Otherwise, most people are simply too paralyzed by fear to make many (any) conscious decisions when they realize violence is about to take place.<br/><br/>But then shit breaks out, and chances are you have no idea what happened, except that the world spun for a moment, and now you're on the ground with a broken rib, and the other guy is walking away, or maybe lying on the ground dead (depending on the weaponry involved).<br/><br/>All tournament-style combat sports (boxing, tae kwon do, etc) have specific rules to keep the fight from being over that fast--i.e. to extend proceedings. They are not a good point of reference for real fighting. For instance: kicking? Pretty much useless unless your opponent is on the ground and you're standing, or unless you can get them in the, uh, vital area or hit their kneecap. Take the word of someone with lots of actual fighting experience over me, but I'm fairly certain you never see anyone in an actual fight for survival successfully land any kind of kick with any effect. The few martial arts experts I know who have actual fighting experience all said that kicking anywhere above the waist is purely a training exercise, useless in any real life situation. It's just too slow and too energy-costly.<br/><br/>What _I_ would really like to know is how likely someone is to react effectively after being hit. For example, let's say someone hits you on the side of the head with a good blow from a bottle. How likely is: a) an average noncombatant, b) an "adventurer" (i.e. person with significant adrenaline-related instincts), c) an experienced fighter to be able to shake it off and react to what's happening in any meaningful way? Within half a second? Within a second?<br/><br/>Most people unused to the shock of pain tend to be fazed and/or disabled by it until they can shake it off. Then again, sometimes you can suffer a severe injury (like losing a limb) and not notice it until minutes later. Anyone have some data on this?<br/><br/>(Edit: I remember reading a few years back some kind of military study in which they concluded that soldiers who were wounded were pretty much always either rendered inoperative immediately, or could fight on with no loss of effectiveness (at least in the short-term). There was very little middle ground. But I don't have a link for that.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258437/#Comment_258437" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T08:40:53+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  8:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2010 8:44AM by Andy.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this a hack for any RPG?

I think it was, "hurt, but no game effects" (at least for now), "hurt significantly enough for serious penalties, applied immediately", "incapacitated", and "dead/destroyed". <br/><br/>Each stage corresponded to one level of success in the mechanics, and there were adjustments for what area you hit, if desired (for instance, an axe blow at the torso might be unmodified, but the same axe blow at a person's hand might be upgraded by one or two categories). The interpretation of the categories was different depending on weapon type. For instance, punching someone in the head at "dead/destroyed" level was merely an instant KO, whereas a "hurt significantly enough for serious penalties" from a bullet to the head would probably be lethal unless treated very thoroughly. But the immediate effects were according to that scale.<br/><br/>Hurt body parts were handled fairly subjectively. If your hand was "hurt significantly enough for serious penalties", you'd suffer penalties doing anything with that hand, but no penalties for, say, running. Adjacent areas might be affected for half the penalty, if appropriate (for instance, if you were using *both* hands).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258450/#Comment_258450" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T09:09:49+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  9:09AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Andy,<br/>My bad.
