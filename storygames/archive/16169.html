Playing that brought up a stumbling block for me in some systems: GM-level (rather than NPC-level) resources that seem pitched as though they are tactical.  <br/><br/>I am fine with NPC-level tactical resources.  That is, a given NPC has resources, and when they are in a conflict with a PC, I can play out the NPC and use their resources tactically according to how I see that character.  For example, in HERO System or Dogs in the Vineyard, I can make my moves based on what I think the NPC is trying for, and use my best tactics towards these ends.  (As a side note, I can't play more than one tactical side at once, so if the NPCs are on multiple sides, all but one of the NPC sides are pretty flat and/or dumb.)  <br/><br/>However, if there is a resource that I can't approach in-character as an NPC, then it presents an issue for me - namely, what am I playing for?  As a player, I will generally use out-of-character resources to play to win.  As a GM, I will use out-of-character resources to push the PCs so that the opposition is dangerous, but to generally let them win rather than beat them.  As a player, though, if I think the GM is just letting me win, the whole process of conflict can feel like jumping through hoops.  <br/><br/>So examples...  <br/><br/>In Polaris, I find I can play to win as the Mistaken.  The game still works if I try my best to achieve my ends as Mistaken.  However, in FATE, I have trouble with enemy Fate Points.  Partly this is expectations.  In Polaris, players generally accept that horrible things will happen to the PCs - and indeed sometimes players enjoy this so much that there is a different problem.  However, in Spirit of the Century or Dresden Files, with a solitary GM, I have trouble playing to win.  <br/><br/>One key part of this is this:  As an opponent to the PCs, in many rule systems my best move is to take out the easiest target.  Whoever has the highest offense-over-defense ratio should be targeted and dropped first.  However, as game play this sucks for that player, so I try to avoid doing that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368612/#Comment_368612" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T10:52:56+00:00" title="March 20, 2012 10:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what I'm looking for:  ideas on other ways to play tactically as a GM or GM-like role.

There were some loopholes and problems but mostly it was pretty effective. But it was not an especially strong RPG in terms of characters and stuff outside of the GM's kill-you budget.<br/><br/>Burning Empires obviously is built on this, IMO to incentivize more gut-level, visceral play from the GM (some might say "trick the GM into not pulling his punches"). The Infection mechanics are vital, though, and taking it away kills the adversarial GM role. <br/><br/>But trying to bolt that play onto a game where GM discretion is limitless?

Actually rolling the Doom Pool for opposition is one of the least interesting/important things you can do with it (as even a very very large Doom Pool is not likely to produce a really high-level outcome).  Instead you should be unlocking new villains, causing complications and scene distinctions, and basically using the Doom Pool to express <i>how bad things have gotten</i>.  It's really more of a descriptive mechanic than an oppositional one, although of course it does get rolled in opposition too. <br/><br/>With Smallville it's a little less of a pacing mechanic and more of a "swing" mechanic - when the players have been rolling a lot of dice, the Trouble pool relatively slowly fills - it means that the world can swing back in opposition to them.  So it is a lot more directly an opposition mechanic than the Doom Pool is.  But of course opposition in Smallville is very different because of the way Stress works there.<br/><br/>Hope that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368656/#Comment_368656" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T13:49:35+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  1:49PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2012 1:56PM by jhkim.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>edited to add: cross-posted with jdcorley</i>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Man...I prefer that so so much, honestly, to a game that requires the GM to hand-modulate the threat level so the system doesn't unexpectedly deliver a "game over" result.

Or a GM.<br/><br/>Take death out of the equation. Make failure about other, interesting consequences.<br/><br/>Then, play to win all you want. Cause winning is awesome, cause you get to those other, interesting consequences. So when the GM wins, that doesn't really mean that the players lose. Their characters might lose, but the players win cause they get to see the awesome consequence stuff.<br/><br/>But if the GM winning means that the game grinds to a halt and sucks, then nobody wants that.<br/><br/>When people get roundly defeated in physical conflict, they get captured. Then you get to do that scene where the badguy tells them all about his dastardly plans before putting them into some crazy deathtrap contraption that they escape from when he leaves. <br/><br/>Happened to the 60s Batman ALL THE TIME. That was how he did about half of his detective work. He'd pull some bizarro Sherlock-Holmes-inspired wackiness out of his ass to find the initial caper location, then he'd go and get beat up, then the Joker would tell him his other big plans plans and put him in a deathtrap, then he'd escape and go foil the plans. He practically HAD to fail in order to succeed in the end.<br/><br/>Of course, that works better with a swing mechanic, the way JD describes in Smallville. Not sure if MHRPG works quite that way. But as long as you approach failure as leading to interesting, awesome consequences rather than boring campaign halting blah, then that should help a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368667/#Comment_368667" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T14:34:00+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  2:34PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2012 2:35PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>For example, suppose I have NPC opponents - but the best tactics for the NPC opponents are to quickly take one of the PCs out of the conflict.

Whether a given combat encounter or other problem is challenging, meh, I couldn't care less.  I'm willing to adjust the difficulty to the player's preferences, because whatever they want (easy, difficult, impossible, etc.) makes absolutely no difference to me.<br/><br/>I did misjudge it pretty bad once a few years back, though; I thought that it made sense to make the various goons and thugs the PCs were fighting very defensively-oriented, so that they could take more of a pounding and stick around longer (since the PCs were so focused on offense that I was worried fights would be over before they even started).  The end result was the PCs hitting the bad guys and invariably doing very little damage, and of course, the entirely-defensive posture of the bad guys meant that they rarely hit the PCs and also rarely did any damage, and the players <i>hated that</i>.  It was a disaster; they were as frustrated as they would have been if they had been missing constantly, plus they didn't feel even remotely threatened by the bad guys.<br/><br/>I kept wondering what I could do to even things out again, and then finally, I realized that the players were happier with bad guys who <i>could</i> hurt them but who also fell down quickly: that way, the party might get beat up a little bit, but they would still win if they focused on taking down the most dangerous targets first.  Suddenly, fight scenes flowed better, people were smiling rather than wincing when the dice came out, and I re-learned that I really needed to pay close attention to what the players actually wanted, especially when it was something that I didn't care about one way or the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368669/#Comment_368669" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T14:44:38+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  2:44PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I would say to approach the Doom Pool as a pacing mechanic.

I would call unlocking new villains or creating Complications as opposition - in the sense that these make things harder for the PCs to get what they are trying for.  Those are things that I would absolutely do as part of my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> option of "playing to win".  Playing to win absolutely does not mean being boring or bean-counting.  In games like Paranoia, Dogs in the Vineyard, Polaris, and Call of Cthulhu, I can be quite open about cutting loose on the players. So when a horrific intelligent monster makes the smart choice and rips the head off of the most dangerous PC, all the players can still have fun - because that is part of what they enjoy.  Likewise, when I choose a very bleak and tragic "but only if" in Polaris to oppose a Heart player's statement, I am playing to win.  <br/><br/>I also think there are different senses as well of what is meant by a pacing mechanic.  <br/><br/>I think my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> (pulling punches) is <i>one form of</i> a pacing mechanic.  Within this mode, my basis for decisions is that I don't want things to seem too easy, quick, or anticlimactic - but I also don't want them to be dull slogging or quick failure.  I'm trying to make the going be difficult leading to a heroic success.  Thus, I will spend resources to make things tougher on the PCs if they are breezing through too easily.  However, if they are getting bogged down, I may change my spending choices to lighten up so the players can get through more quickly.  <br/><br/>I realize that's not the only way of deciding pacing, though.  The question is, on what basis do I decide?  Saying that the Doom Pool expresses how bad things have gotten is fine, but how do I decide how bad things have gotten?  Given different options to do with my Doom Pool, what decision process do I use to pick one rather than another?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368671/#Comment_368671" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T14:54:14+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  2:54PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2012 2:55PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Take death out of the equation...But if the GM winning means that the game grinds to a halt and sucks, then nobody wants that.<br/></blockquote>\nIt's amazing to me that anyone anywhere still thinks this.<br/><br/>Are you unaware that a great many GMs and groups all over the world can have a character (or a whole party) die and not have the game grind to halt and, indeed, manage to use it to the game's advantage?<br/><br/>It doesn't work in every kind of game, but it is by no means unheard of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368672/#Comment_368672" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T15:07:21+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  3:07PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not saying I'm unaware of that.

And I agree that there are lots of games where death is fun.  We've had five PC deaths so far in the Call of Cthulhu game I'm playing in, and death is definitely part of the fun.  I was brought down to -2 hit points last session and was totally reaching for a new character sheet when we realized that the doctor can and did save me.  <br/><br/>However, in the case of Marvel Heroic, I never intended to have death be an expected result of losing conflict.  Nevertheless, being Taken Out seems like it'll be tough for the players given expectations.  I might try it for a non-kid group of players, but I suspect that playing to win with my Doom Pool won't go over well.  <br/><br/>My experience is that expectations handle a lot of this.  In games like Paranoia, Call of Cthulhu, Fiasco, Dogs in the Vineyard, and Polaris - players are able to have a lot of fun even as their characters fail and/or die.  However, I don't find that the same thing is as true in superhero or other heroic adventure games.  When my players had their ship destroyed in a Star Trek campaign, for example, it went over like a ton of bricks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368685/#Comment_368685" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T15:34:50+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  3:34PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you don't think failure is fun, then turn it into a matter of escalating consequences.<br/><br/>In other words, the more the players are losing, mechanics-wise, the more their victory is costing, fiction-wise.

It's a lot like the decision about which monster to put in a dungeon room in D&amp;D3. How do you decide? Well, you look at the world and see what makes sense, but there'll be some latitude there, and you look at the characters and see what their capabilities will be fairly challenged by, and there'll be some latitude there, and you look at the players' taste in opposition, and there'll (hopefully) be some latitude there, and so on and so on.<br/><br/>So if you don't want them to be Taken Out, which is fine (Doom is pretty rarely going to Take Out a character, just because of the die types you'll be normally buying into it, by the way) what's the kind of failure that will be interesting to them? The bus full of schoolkids the villain is threatening loses control and goes over the cliff, forcing them to disengage and go save the little kiddies while the villain gets away?  That would be a fun failure for me. I still get to be a superhero but the villain is gonna go blow up a nuclear power plant or something so the game is still going forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368693/#Comment_368693" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T16:25:15+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  4:25PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>So have heroes get Taken Out.

This should represent the group giving up something.  I'm not committed yet to when it should be decided what was given up.  (Having to make something creative up on the spot can be cool, but can also slow things down.)  <br/><br/>3) The real challenge for the players is to get through the conflict while losing as few of these as possible.  <br/><br/>4) Once a player is hit, they are at an immediate disadvantage, but it is harder to go from "hit" and "taken out".  The result is that it is more effective to hit all of the opponents at least once.  <br/><br/>The last is important, because without something like this, the preferred strategy will be to hit the most vulnerable character - then keep hitting them and taking them out repeatedly until the communal points are fully drained.  <br/><br/>In general, there should be as quick a progression as possible from the first PC going down to all the PCs going down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gullerbutry" title="Gullerbutry"><img alt="Gullerbutry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gullerbutry">Gullerbutry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368695/#Comment_368695" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T16:45:20+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  4:45PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been grappling with this a bit in my Fate campaign - it's my first time GMing Fate. Fate has both a pacing mechanic - a pool of fate points for PCs and NPCs - and shifting narrative control - fate points can be used to declare a bit of fiction. It has been an adjustment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been TRYING to not pull any punches - which is hard for me, as I am something of a soft touch. Here's what helped:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The fate pool for NPCs turns out to be self-moderating. If I use them all up in one scene, my NPCs get creamed in the next. So, I have to decide as a GM where I want to put the next oomph.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I've been giving each NPC very clear and specific goals, usually NOT simple PC death. They want to get information, or escape, or kill an NPC close to the PCs - whatever. They can win without leaving a PC corpse. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. The NPC goals also determine how invested they are in a fight - ie, when they concede a conflict. So I can play an NPC to win - right up to the point he starts losing, at which point he folds like a wet noodle.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Finally, Fate has a nice system of Consequences that have teeth (both in the fiction and the mechanics). The most likely outcome of the PCs getting hammered is a series of Consequences, which is good bloody fun without the hard work of writing a new PC in to the story. Consequences leave marks (you could easily go from "Handsome Devil" to "Scarred Survivor," or from "Favored Heir" to "On The Run.")<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I'd sum it up as, "set limits, then play to win within those limits."  I am still having a hard time juggling compels, but it seems to be working. My players are more nervous than they used to be, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368702/#Comment_368702" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T17:28:59+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  5:28PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Well, if we're talking about ideal mechanics for this - my tastes at the moment would lean towards the following:</blockquote>\nSounds neat.
