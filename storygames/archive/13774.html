They were trying to secure permission to dock from the pirates in Uriah Flint's pirate city while maneuvering and not getting shot out of the sky by the privateer that they've just screwed over. Lady Blackbird, up to this point, had been trying to keep her actual identity a secret, but was now feeling the pressure of the situation and needed to come clean so Flint would let them land. "Okay," I said to her. "What are you telling the pirates manning the comm?" "Umm... I say 'Tell Uriah about the waterfall, er, and how, hm, the babies... screamed.'"<br/><br/>One of those beautiful and hilarious and horrible moments that emerges out of nothing where I'm reminded exactly why I game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
