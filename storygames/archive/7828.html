I've read some of the roleplaying poems, I've read "A Game in a Park", and the two games in the Murderland Contest (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=173125" rel="nofollow">We Eat Murder</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=173348" rel="nofollow">RAVEN - Claw and Beak</a>) ...<br/><br/>And I don't get it. I sort of get We Eat Murder, but RAVEN - Claw and Beak? I just don't get what it's supposed to do. I see a number of problems with it. For example, you take a conflict from your personal life, and you get to decide exactly how you solve it. The game "mechanics" kick in if you solve it by causing pain to yourself or others. If you do, you get to stab a teddybear. But why would I solve it by causing pain to myself or people I know? The one reason I can see is that the game won't end until I do, so I'd probably just toss in a "Oh, and then I stab someone" at the end, just to end the game.<br/><br/>Or the repeating of the lines each time you hug the bear. I could probably do it with feeling the first time, but you have to do it four times per player, and it'll just get silly or emotionless, no?<br/><br/>Tell me what the games are supposed to do, so I can judge them on their own merits. If the idea is to open intimacy between the players, I just can't see how most of these games would accomplish that. If the idea is something else, then tell me!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173414/#Comment_173414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T01:47:20+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  1:47AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 1:47AM by Matthijs.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can only speak authoritatively for my own game(s) - Tomas is, in many ways, his very own design tradition, and it often takes me some time to catch up with what he's doing. His games are also often open for personal interpretation, as I see them; they're not necessarily the humming, gleaming engines of the Forge game engineering tradition, but open questions in a tradition of personal art and poetry. <br/><br/>"But why would I solve it by causing pain to myself or people I know?" My answer would be: Because sometimes people do this in real life. Just like it's pretty boring to play a role-playing game if your character is a one-dimensional person who does everything right in all situations, Raven will fall flat if you portray yourself in such a way. (Remember all those discussions about DitV, how if you only try to minimax the rules you're not getting the most out of the game, even if your character becomes an awezum killing machine? This seems to be related to that.)<br/><br/>"If the idea is to open intimacy between the players, I just can't see how most of these games would accomplish that." My answer, again: It's possible that the intimacy is not an end result, but a prerequisite for successful play.<br/><br/>(I'd be more than happy to answer questions about my own games, BTW <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_173417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173417/#Comment_173417" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T02:08:13+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  2:08AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 2:08AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon: I fully appreciate your blank spots in regards to our games. They are written in a different design tradition than yours. To get anything out of them you would have to play them, and even then you may fail to get it. But if you got it, you would most probably be in over your head, and come out of it gasping for breath. We often make games for a different kind of fun, the kind of fun that challenges you to be brave and truthful and vulnerable. We write other games too, and play indies from the US, but we have a tradition of meeting new designs with a supportive bravado that makes for a design tradition on the search for any wild or wounded narrative possible.<br/><br/>Be my guest, Simon, play my games! I will celebrate the outcome with you, or stand by you if you still don't get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173422/#Comment_173422" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T03:39:02+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  3:39AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But ... that's not saying anything! From my perspective, it looks like this: You guys make tiny, weird games that are just silly and don't do much, except require some intimacy. Then you say that you have to play them to get them, and even if you do, you might not get it.<br/><br/>It feels a bit like a cop-out.<br/><br/>This is all said in full respect, and I'm not saying you actually do that, but it looks like that from my perspective. Why do I have to play them? What happens if I do? If intimacy is a requirement rather than a goal, what is the goal? What kinds of design decisions do you face, and how do you think when you make them? Why is the line that is said when you hug the teddybear phrased like that, instead of some other way?<br/><br/>I'm looking to see some purpose and method to your design methodology. Just because it's not the same tradition as mine doesn't mean I can't appreciate it or understand at least part of it. Right?<br/><br/>I think I possibly might want to try one of the less esoteric games, but I have a hard time imagining that anyone I know would want to play it with me. And I wouldn't blame them; I'm not sure I'd want to play them, either. Partly because some of them are uncomfortable, and partly becasue they're ... silly. Again, all this is my perspective. I'm not claiming your games are actually silly, but they sure seem that way to me.<br/><br/>You other story gamers out there, who have posted appreciative comments about these games, have you tried anything from this tradition, and can shed some light on my confusion?<br/><br/>As it stand now, I feel I can't comment your games at all, because, well, I have no idea wether they're well made or not. They could be works of genius or total crap, for all I know, if I don't know what you're trying to accomplish. And I'm not sure if I'm the only one not getting it. If I'm not, then entering such a game in a competition feels a bit weird, because, well, how is the judge going to decide a winner if he can't see if the games are well made or not? This is, of course, up to Jonathan Walton, but if he decides on three finalist games that he'll play with his friends, and you have to play the game to get it, well, that's a problem, no?<br/><br/>Okay, I'm rambling now, so I should end this post.

At N\xf8rwegian Style you can, for example, take a look at "The New Middle Ages", "Zombie Porn" (mine), "New Voices in Art", "Storyboard" or "Charles the Bald" (mine). From your comments, it looks like you've only read the shortest entries, which, of course, won't give you the full picture.<br/><br/>Of <i>course</i> you can appreciate and understand the games you're talking about! But I'm not sure how you expect to do that except by playing them. (Right now, it's like you're trying to understand "Die Hard" or "The Seventh Seal" just by reading the script, and complaining that the director is telling you you should probably watch the movie).<br/><br/>Here are some design decisions I faced with two of my games. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>First of all, <b>We Eat Murder</b>. I won't claim it's a game I worked very hard on (it is, basically, a playable first draft), but there is some methodology behind it - and a lot of intuition.<br/><br/>The idea of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7730" rel="nofollow">f\xf8ringer</a> is something some of us are playing around with. How much of a game can you define by non-mechanical means? This is probably a central point of confusion: While you see something devoid of mechanics, I see something full of hints and guidelines for play. <br/><br/>In "We Eat Murder", the title, for example, is meant to say "playing this will be a collective effort; the game will describe physical, personal things about your character's body; the line between metaphor and in-game reality may be blurred". The intro texts for each part are also written to be ambiguous and disturbing, which should further inform play. <br/><br/>The inclusion of so few structuring elements will tell the reader that what little there is, is there for a purpose; you can't skip any of the rules, like you would if you played GURPS, for example. <br/><br/>The three-act structure implicitly says "this is related to classical drama". It suggests to players that they should probably expect cathartic play, and use story structures suitable for such. This is further supported by the text, which puts the players in the role of agents of vengeance.<br/><br/>The distributions of authority are different in the three parts. In the first and third, players are informed by someone else of their actions, or what happens to their body. This is a springboard for further narration. It reinforces the group feeling that is in the game: We're all the same, we're in this together; these ritual actions are something we do together; the limits between my body and yours will disappear; our identities are unclear, we are a combined force. <br/><br/>In the second part, the "leadership" role is a sham. What's important is that the ugly player gets focus, showing both that ugliness will take a lead in the scene, and that the game itself <i>intends to do ugly things to you, and show you your own ugliness</i>. Perhaps you will accept it, perhaps not. Anyway: Everyone knows the leader has no way of enforcing anything, except by talking; players will expect shambling chaos. At the same time, this is the most strongly structured scene when it comes to actions - there will be death and mutilation. Nobody needs to tell you to make it ugly.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>When it comes to one of my RPPs, <b>Five characters in search of an identity</b>, it's obviously a reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Characters_in_Search_of_an_Author" rel="nofollow">Six Characters in Search of an Author</a>. As soon as it starts, everyone knows they're in meta-land: The characters are characters in a role-playing game, but they don't know what characters they are. This spawns confusion, which in turn heightens awareness and somehow seems to make people very happy. <br/><br/>After a while, someone actually receives an identity, which makes people both relieved and apprehensive: Okay, we're getting identities; what identity will I get? (I think I stole this from the larp "Limbo", now that I think of it). <br/><br/>The identities at first seem to suggest a standard family setup, and players are probably expecting either "The Little House on the Prairie" or some drama about incest. Then, all of a sudden, one player has to portray "the dead dog", which is an open and obvious humorous challenge from the writer to the players: What are you going to do now? It's another moment of tension while players wonder what the dog will do.<br/><br/>Finally, to top everything off, one player becomes "God" - and then another player becomes "God". Chaos usually ensues; it's not really the best part of the game, but it works okay.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>(While I know a lot of people think modern art is rubbish, I don't. I have no problem with looking at something and thinking "well, the artist may have spent years on this, or she might just have thrown it together at the spur of the moment; it may be part of an ongoing project or trend, or a unique personal statement; I don't really care, I'm going to look at it and see what I think." And then sometimes, of course, I think "Oh yeah, it was rubbish, well, let's move on to the next piece".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_173425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173425/#Comment_173425" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T04:30:48+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  4:30AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 4:34AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anything Matthijs have said in this thread so far is true for me too.<br/><br/>No one's cop'ing out here, Simon.
