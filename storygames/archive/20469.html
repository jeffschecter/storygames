It takes players from level 1 to 15. There is zero chance I can schedule a traditional campaign of this type - calendaring is just too tough.<br/>West Marches is a campaign style where there are 10-20 players but only 3-5 show up for a given sessions.<br/><br/>I already have ~15 interested players and I'm going to try combining WM and PotA over the coming months. I'd love any thoughts and tips you all have.<br/><br/>Here are some initial things I'm considering:<br/><br/>* There will be some frame story about why all the players are working together and interested in the main quest<br/>* All players will automatically level up together so there's no penalty for missing a few weeks<br/>* We'll be sending session recaps out so that folks can stay updated on campaign progress<br/>* I'll likely create some side game / content for activity happening away from the table - i.e. what characters are up to between sessions or when not present                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449985/#Comment_449985" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T13:36:41+00:00" title="December 14, 2015  1:36PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Princes of the Apocalypse</i> had caught my attention recently because the book is just so beautiful.

Thus, players could get to play their characters on different levels (on the timeline) or possibly play different characters (i.e. their former character's ancestor or grand-child).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/randylubin" title="randylubin"><img alt="randylubin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/505/nE54DFMU8ZDV0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/randylubin">randylubin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449995/#Comment_449995" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T17:23:09+00:00" title="December 14, 2015  5:23PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoah - that sounds amazing, though super complicated.<br/><br/>I've been wanting to use Microscope to build a world for an RPG for a while - I bet the 'scenes' could be replaced by adventure sessions.<br/><br/><i>Princes</i> has such rich worldbuilding and timeline that I'm going to hold off on using Microscope for this campaign.

So, PCs can basically do whatever they want, in a sand-box style, yet the players still have a common question that they should be able to answer in that session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/randylubin" title="randylubin"><img alt="randylubin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/505/nE54DFMU8ZDV0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/randylubin">randylubin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450117/#Comment_450117" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-19T17:53:42+00:00" title="December 19, 2015  5:53PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like I'm going to run it a bit more straight forward for now but I'll definitely be experimenting as the campaign progresses.<br/><br/>My frame story is that the different Factions (Lord's Alliance, Zhentarim, etc) are experimenting with a new cross organizational peace-keeping force to promote prosperity in the backwaters of the Realm. The players all signed on to help with the first rollout of this program. Some will also belong to the Factions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
