I'd use something like PDQ or The Pool for this:<br/>\n<br/>\nA modern day game where a Gun is the central "character". The GM begins play by describing the location/situation of the gun. Is it at the pawn shop, or on a cop's hip? It might be laying on the ground, next to a dead body, in a dank back alley. The situation should be in media res, at the edge of conflict. The GM turns to the first player and says simply go. The player then carries the narrative, creating a character on the spot. Play moves around the table, player to player, in the same way. Players shouldn't become too attached to their Characters, as they won't remain in the narrative for long. This game should follow the Gun, with the players creating new characters as the Gun moves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple Example: Player 1(decides to play Tom, the unhappy husband) picks up the Gun, carries it home. Player 2 (Becky, the housewife) catches him about to commit suicide. There's a scuffle, Tom accidentally shoots Becky. But Becky was the cause of Tom's misery so Tom decides he wants to live. He gets rid of the body and tries to move on. Player 3 decides to play Sammy, a thief. He breaks into Tom's house and steals the gun. Play would now follow Sammy. Players 1 and 2 would create new characters more appropriate to Sammy's world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to have to give this a try. Wasn't there a show on cable similar to this? IIRC, it was a western.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81582/#Comment_81582" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T00:47:12+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 12:47AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the idea has a lot of potential.

Your wizard could get eaten by a geltanious cube, and it didn't matter too much because that character's story was unimportant.

Only in this game, instead of these people coming into play as situational modifiers, they actually become the player's characters. It takes a bit away from the "Object as Character" idea, yet it should add a sense of "this is what I care about."<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's say Player 2, from my earlier example, began the game with the character Becky, who died during the scuffle with her husband Tom. Player 2 then chooses George, Becky's High School sweetheart, from Becky's list of Relationships. Sometime later, after Sammy the Thief steals the gun (which Tom should have gotten rid of to begin with), Becky's body is found. Sammy recognizes the house on the news coverage, and on a hunch, attempts to blackmail Tom...<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, now that I look at it, this strays too far away from the Gun, becoming more Becky's story. Well, at the least, you can play with building a story through the Relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see I'm still working on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Michael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
