COming to you with what is probably a good problem - but a very real and pressing one.<br/><br/>I've been running a fairly heavy mechanical game (Exalted 2nd white wolf) for a large group (started at 6, now its 8 with another newbie wanting to join) for nearly a year now every week (40 weeks).<br/><br/>Its great, but handling more than 4-5 players in the one session in REALLY REALLY hard. If anyone has some best practices/hints and tips on how to handle a game session for so many characters I would be very interested in hearing them. I've noticed that the 4-5 player sessions tend to run very well, focussed and are enjoyable for everyone. But the larger sessions tend to have either some people doing almost nothing, or everyone feeling under appreciated as focus changes so much.<br/><br/>I've also noticed that the players tend to divide into 2 groups and have two almost parallel stories going on in a session when there are so many...<br/><br/>I've tried to run this game as a "westmarches" type game - where not everyone is expected every session, with a safe(ish) home city where they are all based, and expeditions/investigations going to different areas lasting only 2-3 sessions at most before they are back at their home base... But it doesn't always work when everyone turns up for a session...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432859/#Comment_432859" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T08:03:43+00:00" title="May 20, 2014  8:03AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frame two separate concerns that roughly divide the player group in two. Process one of the concerns into a form that the players can handle among themselves, with perhaps some light distribution of authority (e.g. assign some particular player to play a NPC in the scene). Handle the more complex half of the group yourself.<br/><br/>For example: while you run a complex infiltration storyline that introduces a lot of new information about a specific urban setting, taking all of your attention and half of the players, have the rest deal with a long-running nemesis who comes up and requests a duel. Pick a responsible player with a good grasp of that NPC's deal to run them, give them a like two sentences worth of advice about what the NPC wants/fears, and send them off to play the duel (with setting, dialogues, stunting, the works - important that they really play and not just roll dice while the GM's not watching them). Have them report back to you about the outcome in half an hour or however long it takes, then perhaps remix the groups a bit for another cycle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432860/#Comment_432860" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T08:08:56+00:00" title="May 20, 2014  8:08AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2014 8:14AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the exact same problem in an AW campaign I'm running (you can read the APs <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19296/watch-the-world-die-emergence-aw" rel="nofollow">here</a>).  I made matters worse on myself by deciding to start with two totally different character groups (one group of vault-dwellers and one group of above-grounders).  The campaign is going well but moving forward VERY slowly, as you can imagine.  Cutting back and forth (Tolkien-style) sounds great in my head, but in reality the four people who aren't playing at any given moment tend to get distracted.<br/><br/>It's a tough problem and I can't say I've totally solved it.  But I have done a few things that seemed to help a bit:<br/><br/>- Make sure there are some topical or at least thematic connections between the two scenes, in order to keep group B interested in what group A is doing (and vice-versa).  Admittedly this can get a little bit railroady, but I don't know what else to say; sometimes the hand of the author is necessary.<br/><br/>- When you do jump back and forth, do it very frequently, in the shortest bursts possible.  Almost surprise them when you turn to the other group and say "OK NOW YOU...  What are you doing?"<br/><br/>- Try to stay away from situations where one group is in combat and the other group isn't.  Because of the time-compression and excitement of combat, it's difficult to pull attention away from the fighting group at that moment.  I'm trying to get better at this trick: Raise the NPC's weapon over the player's head ... and then CUT! over to the other group!  Think of how a TV show cuts to a commercial just at the most tense or suspenseful moment.<br/><br/>- I don't know what sort of story you're doing, but if you add some mystery elements and clues it might be easier to keep everyone tuned in, because clues can be found all over the map.  This might turn "two parties" into "one distributed party" with a single strategic vision.<br/><br/>ETA: Eero's idea of sending one group off has occurred to me too.  I'm a little scared to try it with my players, but based on his advice, I just might.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432867/#Comment_432867" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T10:05:16+00:00" title="May 20, 2014 10:05AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2014 10:11AM by Paul_T.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a similar/related vein, how practical would it be to rope one of the other players into a being a co-GM?<br/><br/>This is not territory which is very well explored, in my experience - I haven't seen very many robust techniques for two GMs in a single game - but you would pretty quickly develop some. Effectively, you could do what you would be doing in Eero's example of a player running a duel at a sidetable all the time.<br/><br/>I know two gamers in New York who will often GM together, with one person handling the funny voices and the fictional description, while the other handles all the mechanical aspects of play, plays monsters or NPCs in combat, and that kind of thing. They've done it enough that it's become very smooth and natural for them.<br/><br/>Other thoughts:<br/><br/>1. Sometimes the mechanical aspect of play can eat up a lot of time (logistics in an OSR game, all the die-rolling involved in even a short combat in other games, stuff like that). If the players can handle that themselves, or with a co-GM, that could be a way to save time: you deal with sub-group A while sub-group B counts up experience points and buys equipment or fights that unpredictable monster or whatever.<br/><br/>So, consider which aspect of your game is eating up a lot of attention or time in terms of mechanics and see if you can offload it somehow.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with Exalted, but changing to a lighter game system might be a good idea, as well, if the game demands a lot of handling time, simply so more can happen in a typical session. (Nothing's worse that coming to a game session just to sit there while other players with concerns unrelated to yours are chewing through some mechanical process which ultimately makes no difference to you at all.)<br/><br/>2. Give players NPCs to play whenever possible, or give them the authority over limited aspects of the fiction. There are often times when you need some detail about something, but you don't have a particular vision of how exactly it should go. <br/><br/>For example, they crack the safe in the boss's office and find some various business records. You haven't really given a thought to what exactly might be in there, so a while the players are planning the heist (or rolling dice, or whatever), you turn to your player Linda and say: "Ok, give a thought as to what might be in that safe, and I'll be right back." When the players break in to the safe, she gets a chance to present her ideas. (This could be especially fun if the players could actually prepare a physical handout or otherwise contribute detail to the setting you're exploring.)<br/><br/>Or maybe there's a guard at the local nightclub who's becoming a bit of a regular NPC, and you don't have anything planned for him: so give him to a player from the other group to play.<br/><br/>You could even formalize a system for players "grabbing" the authority to control or determine the nature of characters, places, or things. A player spends 5 points to establish control over what's in that safe, while another spends 3 to claim a particular NPC, and a third spends 10 points to write up the nature of the stock market in the neighbouring city. That kind of stuff.<br/><br/>(We have this going on in a very organic way in the ongoing D&amp;D game over IRC, with various GMs contributing different information to the game whenever they run sessions. One of the fun things to do is that you can turn to another player and ask them for detail on something when you don't have an idea yourself - "Hey, what kind of people live in that forest over to the East, anyway?")<br/><br/>3. One thing which could really help is developing the campaign in such a way that the various players or characters have linked concerns, so that they are each interested in the other's progress.<br/><br/>One way is AW's "PC-NPC-PC triangles", if you're familiar with those. The concept here, more generally, is to reincorporate so that whatever fictional elements are important to PC group A are also important, but in a different way, to PC group B. If PC group A is trying to take down an organization which is their enemy group, make that same organization the suppliers for PC group B, and necessary in some way. If group A takes down this organization, it will cause problems for group B, giving them more of an interest in seeing how things will shake out.<br/><br/>Similarly, if group A discovers a mysterious letter, and you haven't decided who wrote yet, tell it's signed by [the name of some NPC who is really important to group B]. This kind of surprise gives the players more investment in what's happening "on the other side" of the action, at least enough to keep paying attention and being interested in what's going on. You don't even need to know right away why this coincidence has happened; just throw some out there and let the players hypothesize about why they are happening.<br/><br/>4. Another, more direct, way to do this is to set up the PCs to be at odds with each other. The more your scenes and conflicts are PC-on-PC, the fewer people are sitting around waiting for you to hash something out with a player. The more everyone's concerns are tied up with one another, the more they have to interact, and the more of a stake they have in the outcome of any given action.<br/><br/>If PC A is trying to uncover what that mysterious organization is doing and bring it down, PC B is, unbeknownst to him (but known to us all), working for that same organization, PC C is trying to hunt down and kill PC A, and PC D needs PC B's blood to power a mystical ritual which will cause PC E's family (which happens to own the very same mysterious organization) to sicken and die... you've got lots going that affects every player's interests and much of the action will be taking place between the players, not GM-player, keeping everyone involved.<br/><br/>A very tight and convoluted relationship map, in other words, could do wonders, even if your group or the game you're playing isn't great from PvP conflict - identify each character's interests and tie them as tightly as possible (but in unpredictable ways) into the other characters'. (If you want to post some of your characters' points of focus, I'd be happy to demonstrate via example; it's not the easiest thing to explain just like this.)<br/><br/>Ultimately, playing with a large group is a challenge that can't be entirely resolved without changing the game you're playing in some fundamental way. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try a few different things and see what happens!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432881/#Comment_432881" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T05:36:50+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  5:36AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's 24 degrees outside and I have just been in the sun reading the following from Start With Why. The book is about companies and how leaders inspire but this is striking for roleplaying games as well. I'm clarifying in brackets.\n<blockquote>When a company [gaming group] is small, this is not an issue because the founder has plenty of direct contact with the outside world [the players and the game]. /.../ The founder or leader actually goes out and talks to customers [playing NPCs], sells the product [using game mechancics] and hires most if not all the employees [handles players]. /.../ When a company grows, the leader becomes physically removed, further and further away from WHAT the company does [actual play], and even farther away from the outside market. /.../ The leader must ensure that there are people on the team who believe what they believe [why we're playing] and know HOW to build it [creating conflicts from situations].</blockquote>\nI think the hardest thing to game master is one player. Then you need to respond constantly and the gaming becomes really intense, and not only in a good way. When I game master 8-10 people, I can assume a more relaxed state. You can game master the a larger group the same way as with 3-4 players but with a great workload.<br/><br/>My way of handling larger group is by being a diminishing game master that sometimes jump in and reminds people of why we play or by feeding them with new situations. Instead of having the players react to me, I react to what the players do. If they are busy doing something, I'm satisfied and take the time to plan ahead. I seldom care about what they do but about what's going to happen next. I make myself present by sometimes steering them into a certain direction of gaming.<br/><br/>Something I tend to do is what <a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a> wrote: divide them into groups and put them into certain situations. I tend to see it as I'm throwing in a ball to the players to see how they play with it. When one group is busy, then I turn to the other group to activate them and I then go back and forth to constantly activate them - to give them a push towards the game style that we want to play. What can happen when you switch focus from one group to another is that the first group stops to play because they don't have your attention. Reassure them to keep playing by themselves. If you miss something, ask them for a summary later on when you have activated with the second group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432884/#Comment_432884" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T07:36:52+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  7:36AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That depends on the experience level of your players.

I think it's a wonderful metaphor, but, as a reader, I don't know how, in practice, you apply these techniques. What does it look like when you "activate the second group", or "react to what the players do"? Let's say you have those 8-10 players in front of you, ready for you to start the game.

If I knew more about how <a href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">@Dionysus</a> played, except what kind of game the group plays, I could probably give examples better suited for this thread. In short, how would you handle a game that had 20 or 100 participants? You can't be everywhere monitoring them so you need to take this on in a totally different way, and leave it open for a result to appear from all the interactions between the players.<br/><br/>An easy way is to give everybody a goal but let them have different reasons of why they want to reach the goal. A group splits, which is good in this case, because they have different visions of what they want to achieve. Concentrate more on player interaction and less on finishing an adventure. You don't even have to have a clear ending. I used to hate when the group had a quarrel, because I - as a game master - wanted to finish the adventure, but now I bless it. People arguing are people engaged. That's the only thing you need to concentrate on.<br/><br/>And it's important that people can play on their own. Talk with them about it. Experienced (non-GM) gamers would have a trouble with this, while beginners could pick it up easier. When it comes to creating adventure, I would recommend a starting point similar to <b>Apocalypse World</b> or a <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2/" rel="nofollow">fish tank</a>. <b>Exalted </b>is about intrigues so focus on that and put the players in important positions. That's the easy way, anyway.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Note, you can do this with 3-4 players but because there are so few players, the interaction wont be as successful. Here is where the game master normally steps in and provide NPCs that the players can interact with (either fighting, talking to or bargaining with). With bigger groups, the game master can instead step down and let the interaction between the only the players. Yeah, it sounds like a mini-LARP and it's not far from it. Except that people aren't in costumes and walking around. (Haven't LARPed so I dunno, truth be told.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432889/#Comment_432889" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T10:53:38+00:00" title="May 21, 2014 10:53AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, Thanks for the responses - some is helpful, but Rickard may be right and I need to unpack my situation a little more.<br/><br/>This is a very freeform game when it comes to "story". I have no real preplanned plot, and the players are always welcome to provide input (which helps a lot in keeping them interested.<br/><br/>When we made the characters the players were told to have a number of connection with each other from the outset, and ties to NPCs as well. Much of the plot happens when a player asks "what happens if..." and we go from there.<br/><br/>(if interested, a brief summary of all our session, and player writeups are here: <a href="http://belicht.obsidianportal.com/wikis/sessions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://belicht.obsidianportal.com/wikis/sessions</a>)<br/><br/>tl:dr - most of what happens in the game is about choice/consequence for the characters or the world around them.<br/>An example- one player wanted to be a demonologist - he made his character as "child raised by church with unknown parentage, now acting exorcist". So I made sure to thrown in hints of demonic activity all the time. The player said at the table "i wonder what all these have in connection, must be a demon summoner somewhere nearby - and boom we had a "big bad".<br/><br/>Basically i am taking the gm rules from Apocalypse World and applying them - things that come out of play get put back into later sessions, and when a ouple of players latch onto a named NPC I spin up a "front" and start working with that. I am constantly asking how the character's are reacting to the situations, <br/><br/>My biggest problem is allowing all the players to particpate in scenes, usually only 1 or 2 get to really react to something before the situation has changed enough that the others cant do what they wanted.

And here is what I did:<br/>1) I did strict spotlight sharing. Every player got a turn to say something/do something.<br/>2) I made sure that everyone made character for the same game (e.g., no politicos in a combat-heavy game, not hack and slashers in a stealth game, etc.)<br/>3) I let go of a lot of the stuff that bothers people in smaller games. So, I didn't get upset when peeps busted out the cell phone, etc. The reason is simple. Once combat starts, it can be 10+ mins before you have to do anything again. outside of combat, it is less predictable (meaning it could be shorter or longer).<br/>4) I also paid special attention to wallflowers. You have to give them a chance to really shine as they will get less and less chances.<br/>5) I kept the group together (but this was mostly because I suck at juggling lots of side stories with a group this big).<br/>6) I didn't sweat it when my BBEGs went down like a clown, it is hard to design a BBEG that can stand up to 8 attacks...<br/>  There is probably more I am forgetting, please feel free to ask questions if anything comes to you,<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432906/#Comment_432906" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T19:02:45+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  7:02PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like you're already doing the pretty much what I'm suggesting. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>My biggest problem is allowing all the players to particpate in scenes, usually only 1 or 2 get to really react to something before the situation has changed enough that the others cant do what they wanted.

So some people take up more space? Great, throw the ball to them and concentrate on the wallflowers. When I was game mastering a large group (6-8 people), I developed a way of thinking where I always noticed who were the least active and focused on them. They were the ones who got the clues, who saw an attack coming, that had the storylines on the side.<br/><br/>The dominant ones, or I would rather say <i>the initiative takers</i>, will follow the goal in their own ways and produce most of the situations that occurs. The wallflowers are the ones that I make sure will notice the consequences. This way of thinking, of activating the least active, backfired when I played <b>InSpectres</b> with my last group. I noticed that I always attacked the wallflower to engage her, which made her take damage and be less capable of doing things. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> In another game, I instead let her discover a book that could talk through it's pages - and sometimes gave clues to what was going on. She played an illusionist so she didn't know if it was a real thing or just her character going mental. Most of the times, the book was right but sometimes it was just cryptic.<br/><br/>Never base the main storyline on the wallflower but give them storylines of their own. Then it wont matter if they choose to not pursue them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432912/#Comment_432912" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T00:08:17+00:00" title="May 22, 2014 12:08AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thats pretty good advice Rickard <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> spend my focus on the quiet ones <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432915/#Comment_432915" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T07:23:42+00:00" title="May 22, 2014  7:23AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't tried GMing big groups this way, but I came up with a deck that players can use when their characters aren't present. They can draw a card and take control of a single aspect of the scene, like adding an NPC, taking control of one present, add SFX, details ,adjudicate an automatic success to any character present, etc. Players now call them "the Trolling Cards", and love to use them. It helps a lot to keep players focused on the game and adding material to make things more interesting.<br/><br/>For example, there was this scene where only one player participated in a reunion with the queen, so everyone kept drawing and using cards. The scene ended with the player being ordered to lead an army to the north and discussing what kind of resources and main NPCs he would take with him, and the way it developed left me cold, just saying yes to anything as players kept scalating the tension. We had <i>everyone</i> participate in that scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432927/#Comment_432927" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T14:44:46+00:00" title="May 22, 2014  2:44PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds fantastic, WarriorMonk.

Excuse my poor translation, it's midnight here and I'm kinda sleepy:<br/><br/>-By a hair: Discard this card to give a +2 to a roll made for a PC, NPC or Creature action after the roll is made.<br/>-Critical: Discard this card to adjudicate a critical success to a roll made for a PC, NPC or Creature action.<br/>-Lucky: Discard this card to give an NPC access to any effect of a single Hero Point.<br/>-Battlefield Control: Add up to 3 details in the scene that can be used for tactical advantage by either PCs, NPCs or creatures.<br/>-Weather Control: Change the current weather to anything else that seems plausible for the location.<br/>-Minion's Captain: you take control of the commander of a NPC group. The GM will give you your orders but how to accomplish them is up to you. Die in a spectacular way while commanding your group if you can!<br/>-Innocent Bystander: Take control of a common NPC on the scene. Without the PCs help you will surely die as a collateral damage from the PC's battle.<br/>-Situation complicates: Roll a d6, the Challenge Rating of the scene rises by that amount. Give suggestions to the GM about what happens.<br/>-A ray of hope: Roll a d6, the Challenge Rating of the scene is reduced by that amount. Give suggestions to the GM about what happens.<br/>-Ancient Master: You control an old NPC expert on a single skill of your choice. Can't harm another PC or NPC but your skill keep you safe from any harm. Give advice, test and taunt PCs into facing you on your best skill.<br/>-Messenger: You can control a single NPC messenger and give a message to any PC or NPC of your choice. Give suggestions to the GM about the content of the message.<br/>-SFX: add any sound effect to the scene framed by the GM.<br/>-NPC: you can control a single NPC present on the scene. If there isn't one present, you're free to ask the GM to build and introduce one on this scene.<br/><br/><br/>Some of these included rewards in the game currency (hero points, xp, aiki chits, etc) but I found later that it isn't neccessary, and even may beat the purpose: players love to participate as much as they can, this is a reward by itself, so don't doubt they will go serious on using the cards content to make the story more interesting. Ah, some of these cards have more than one copy, like NPC and SFX; some have a single copy like Ancient Master. Hope any of this helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
