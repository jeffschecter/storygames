I had thought that for the longest time that a character needed a goal to be interesting and enjoyable - it gave them something to risk or something to struggle with.<br/><br/>I think I've just had an epiphany: perhaps it's not the goal that's the important thing; it's the emotional issue behind it that really drives the character.<br/><br/>I've had characters with goals in the past where the goal doesn't come up in play, or the goal may come up in play, but it's really tangential to the story that's going on. Because of that, the game often gets boring.<br/><br/>But in the times where the character has had an <i>emotional</i> issue - trust problems, jealousy, a broken heart, alcoholism, whatever - then I think there's more of an opportunity for those things to come up in play, in a range of different circumstances. Those circumstances may relate directly to the situation that caused those issues, but they may just be unrelated things that trigger an emotional response (the circumstances might trigger a compel, to use SotC parlance). <br/><br/>A character might have multiple issues, with different ones being triggered at different times. The key, I think, seems to be something that's going to trigger an emotional response.<br/><br/>Is this an avenue that bears further contemplation and experimentation? Do people have experiences that refute or confirm the idea? I'm just curious...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152578/#Comment_152578" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T20:22:54+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  8:22PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            we'll i suppose the question is: what are you going to do with the hypothesis?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you trying to find the best game for you, then yeah i guess it would bare some contemplation and some testing, finding some emotional cue games and see if they get the good gaming vibe for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your trying to find some way of explaining it all... well I wouldn't normally say better have tried and failed but i just did.

I'm tired of sitting at a table feeling completely bored out of my skull because I don't give a damn about what's going on in game. I've been looking at finding a way to get more emotional drama into the games I'm playing, rather than just straight combat scenes or whatever.<br/><br/>One of the best gaming experiences I've ever had was a Marvel Universe game (the diceless one) I playing in a chatroom with a friend of mine. Unintentionally, I gave my character a guilt complex, and linked other things in his character - including the use of his super powers - to that. I spent most sessions doing my best to avoid using my main superpower, because it triggered all the guilt he felt. When he did end up having to use them, he went off by himself and got completely pickled (which then led to another interesting setup).<br/><br/>I totally adored the character drama in that game. It was wonderful.<br/><br/>But in a recent Savage Worlds game, there was no emotional drama at all, and everyone at the table was basically bored shitless (and yet too polite to actually speak up and say so). I've pulled the pin on games I've been running because the emotional drama hasn't been there. <br/><br/>I've been trying to figure out why the MURPG game rocked and the others haven't. The only thing I can figure out is in the MURPG, we (consciously or not) played to the character issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152590/#Comment_152590" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T20:49:46+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  8:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my own experience with BW and IAWA: I build a char that's really, really good at something: and then I give them a problem that they can't solve with what they're really, really good at.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm the best swordsman in the land?

Something else?"<br/>\n"Why is this goal (or this alignment) an important one to have?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, even when the GM isn't threatening the alignment or the goal, the player has a framework for reacting to the game world on an emotional level.

If there are no obstacles, then your story is very short and boring under the best of circumstances.  Under the worst of circumstances, you the player need to set aside those goals in favor of whatever the GM has brought to the game, and that can just be fun sucking.<br/><br/>So, you need to be invested in your opposing force. It's possible you can be the author of it, as in the case of you Marvel game.  Guilt as an obstacles was one that _you_ could control, so you were invested in it and it came up to a degree you considered appropriate. That's cool when it works, but it can be wearing unless the game and the GM step up eventually.  <br/><br/>But when you're not authoring your own obstacles, it can get more muddled.  If the game still has a competitive dynamic, the GM throwing those obstacles at you may be seen as unfair or mean.  The obstacles the player is looking to hit are obscured, as in the case of the badass character whose player hates fights. <br/><br/>So, maybe I'm off base here, but I'm definitely going to posit that good experiences came out of a combination of a good sense of direction (character investment, issues, goals, whatever)  coupled with obstacles that you could sink your teeth into (one's that matched your expectations of the sort of obstacles your direction would encounter), and I suspect you have the first part nailed, and that it's the second part that's letting you down.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - This is why I think "What do you want?" is an important question for any character if it's followed by "Why don't you already have it?"<br/><br/>PPS - Alternately, if you just make sure to bake your sense of opposition into an issue, then an issue may have you covered.  The rub is that while many issues imply the shape of their opposing force, they do not always do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152726/#Comment_152726" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T11:39:32+00:00" title="June 24, 2008 11:39AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eynowd,<br/>Hey, you might want to check out my game The Rustbelt; it's designed around this very concept, and there's probably a few ideas in there you can make use of in the games you're already playing.

I'd say you've summed up what writers know when they're constructing their tales.  And I'd say that some people want exactly that from their games.  (Over on The Forge I recently quoted Shawn Ryan, creator and exec. producer on THE SHIELD, who said they never broke a story by what clue was found where or whatnot.  Instead, they thought of the emotional journey they wanted the character to take in an episode, and the plot shook itself out all by itself.)<br/><br/>I'd also say what you've touched on leaves a lot of room for play: a character might have conflicting issues, as has been mentioned; or an issue in conflict with the "world" (NPCs and so on); or an issue that hammers at the characters all the time and they have to make choices how to respond.  Different games will tap this in different ways.  There's no right or wrong way in it -- either by rules in the games or techniques of play.  But certainly some people will respond to some rules and techniques with more verve than others.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eynowd</cite>Is this an avenue that bears further contemplation and experimentation? Do people have experiences that refute or confirm the idea? I'm just curious...</blockquote>\nWell... what your touching on is the work that goes back over a decade now, with the notion that some people are going want game that engage them <i>because</i> of issues dealt with at the table and that this engagement with issues is the <i>reason</i> some people want to play these games.<br/><br/>These conversations produced a whole set of games with a variety of mechanics that deliver the goods on this front in one form or another.<br/><br/>You haven't mentioned the games you've played yet, so please forgive me if this list in redundant.  But off the top of my head here a bunch of great games that deliver <i>exactly</i> what you're talking about:<br/><br/><i>Sorcerer<br/>Sorcerer &amp; Sword<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>My Life with Master<br/>Polaris<br/>HeroQuest</i> (I really recommend using Glorantha, or some setting as interesting or complex)<br/><i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> (when played with Near, or some setting as interesting or complex)<br/><i>The Riddle of Steel<br/>The Burning Wheel<br/>Primetime Adventures<br/>Grey Ranks<br/>Shock:<br/>In A Wicked Age<br/>The Mountain Witch</i><br/><br/>Again, this is just off the top of my head, taking a break from some work. So I'm sure I'm missing some great games.  But these games deliver, and deliver in spades.<br/><br/>I'd add -- as I'm sure others will -- that you can add issues to any game.  My point is simply this: the games listed above set issues at the CORE of the games mechanics.  They ARE what the games are about, and other elements of game play that we expect from RPGs are pared back so as to not get in the way.<br/><br/>If you haven't dipped into the games on that list, you might want to poke around, see what settings and color turn you on, check out some reviews and threads about the games and how they play -- because my guess is they're going to deliver tabletop fun for you in ways you haven't had yet.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152836/#Comment_152836" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T23:47:23+00:00" title="June 24, 2008 11:47PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Character issues I see as being somewhat distinct from goals. Let me explicate:<br/><br/>A recent Star Wars d20 character I played had as a goal to promote good governance, fair dealing, honesty in politics and transparency in government.<br/><br/>I selected this goal because I knew he could not get it, and I wanted to see him go from policy wonk with 8,921-point documents regarding the Omnibus Galactic Budget to a cold-eyed Rebel orator.<br/><br/>So his goal was not the same as his issue. His goal was just something he wanted, or thought he wanted, or was taught he wanted. His issue was that he was an idealist, he believed in decency and fairness and was passionate about it.<br/><br/>Plot elements - what people are describing as "story happening to characters" in disdainful tones (as if no dame ever sashayed into Sam Spade's office and as if a severed hand was never found by a uni in the 87th Precinct) - interacted more with his goals. There would be some threat to his ideals, he would have to do something about it, investigate, look sternly at bad guys and tell them to rethink their lives, etc. But the thing keeping my interest high was the issue, his own perceptions of what was going on, not what he desired or was after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152950/#Comment_152950" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T12:28:27+00:00" title="June 25, 2008 12:28PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2008 12:33PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People are speaking of plot in a disdainful tones? <br/><br/>Now, it's an internet discussion, so it's not always easy to know who his referencing whom... but since I'm the only one who used the word "plot" so far, I wanted to touch on this. (I understand someone used the phrase "story happening to characters" upthread.... but I'm not addressing that rightr now.)<br/><br/>Clearly, it isn't a matter of Issues aginst Plot (though people who like to argue have argued about which actually important since at least the writing of Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i>, which addresses the debate.)<br/><br/>But in my view, without Plot, the Issues can't be revealed.  The Plot makes Issues manifest.  They let us SEE the Issues.<br/><br/>Issues without Plot is a Sylvia Plath poem.  A fine thing it itself, I suppose.  But it's certainly not a story.  And there's nothing <i>concrete </i>to it besides the words on the page.  Plot gives the Issues a visual, aural, and tactile substance.<br/><br/>This is why Goals matter -- why they are vital.  Goals are the rocks upon which Issues break and are revealed to the audience, reader or fellow players.  Likewise, Goals and Plot elements often come smahing down out of nowhere ("story happening to characters") and bang around a character's Issues -- and the result is the character having to make choices that, again, reveal Issues and so the character.<br/><br/>The only question is (and this goes back to Poetics and the big debate) is which comes first, and which matters more.  Some will prefer one starting position or emphasis, some the other. <br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152955/#Comment_152955" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T12:44:30+00:00" title="June 25, 2008 12:44PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe this goes without saying, but a really important part of getting this thing you want, is having a GM and other players who buy into the whole idea. <br/><br/>We had to quit gaming with someone because we wanted to play these issue and emotion-laden games, and he just viewed them like a GURPS disadvantage to use to get more points to spend on skills or as a necessary evil of character creation, and would then ignore them and tread all over everyone else's without any regard for anyone else's fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153554/#Comment_153554" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T10:12:46+00:00" title="June 28, 2008 10:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>Finding a way to word that so it herds people toward abstract concepts would probably be a good idea</blockquote>\nEh, your two questions were <i>right on</i> in my book, but "abstract," not so much (and "abstract' doesn't follow from those two questions). in my experience, focus on "abstract concepts" is both an Issue and Goal killer, as players get bogged down "motivations" divorced from action and/or human feeling.
