Of course, my brain kicked into gear, and a game began to form.<br/><br/><b>The Longest Night<br/></b><br/>Once a year, we gather. No matter from whence we hail, tonight we are joined. Tonight we celebrate the Longest Night. The Dark rules the Day, and we hold our celebration to preserve what we have, to pass through the night and into the new year.<br/><br/>For any number of players.<br/><br/>Everyone stands and gathers in a circle. Everyone has a list of the Questions. The oldest person in the circle begins by answering the first Question.<br/><br/><b>The Questions<br/></b>Why do you celebrate?<br/>What is the celebration?<br/>What does your celebration keep away?<br/>What are the roles in the celebration?<br/>What happens is the celebration goes awry?<br/><br/>After the first Question is answered by the oldest person in the circle, the person to their left answers the next question, and so on. When the question of roles comes up, whomever answers the question assigns those roles to whomever they choose of the circle. For a small group (4), there is only one role. For every additional two people added to the group, add another role.<br/><br/>Whomever answers the last Question (as long as they have not been assigned a role) is the Troubler, the person whose job it is to spoil the celebration. If your group is 9 or larger in number, the Troubler chooses a second Troubler. Every additional 9 players means another Troubler to deal with. The Troubler is a reflection or extension of whatever the celebration is trying to prevent.<br/><br/>Once the celebration, the roles, and the Troubler are established, the person to the left of the Troubler makes a statement. The statement should be simple. Every statement should talk about how that person is a part of the celebration.<br/><br/><b>Sample Statements<br/></b>"I make sure there is wood for the fire."<br/>"I test the sucking roast to see that it is done."<br/>"I sweep the corners a final time."<br/><br/>Once everyone has made a simple statement, the turn will have passed to the Troubler. The Troubler makes a statement about how they are subtly worming their way into the celebration to ruin it. For this first statement, the Troubler can only affect minor things.<br/><br/><b>Sample Troubler Statements<br/></b>"I make sure half the logs are wet and will smoke."<br/>"I stop the spit turning to the roast is unevenly done."<br/>"I place dust in the far-left corner."<br/><br/>If there are multiple Troublers, they get passed over in the initial round of statements. When it comes time for the Troubler to make a statement, all the Troublers get to make a statement.<br/><br/>After the first pass through the group, the nature of the statements change. Anyone without a role continues to make simple statements, building off of the previous statements to create the picture of this celebration.<br/><br/>If someone was assigned role, they can make one of two statements. They can make a simple statement, as above, or they can make a preventive statement directly to the Troubler. A statement to the Troubler should indicate how the person filling the role does something for the celebration that directly prevents the Troubler from interfering. This includes turning celebrators back to helping the celebration (see below).<br/><br/><b>Sample Preventive Statements<br/></b>"I begin anointing the brows of the faithful to seal in their souls."<br/>"I place the barred holly over the lintels to ward away the spirits."<br/>"I prepare the sacred garments so the High Priest will be ready."<br/><br/>Every preventive statement has an action and a result, whereas the simple statements are just actions.<br/><br/>When the Troubler's turn comes, they can make a simple statement about ruining the celebration, or they can make a statement about how they influence on the of celebrators (anyone without a role).<br/><br/>Every time the Troubler makes a statement about a celebrator, that person has been influenced, and must make statements about how they work to ruin the celebration. This continues until someone with a role makes a statement about how they bring that celebrator back to the celebration.<br/><br/><b>Resolution<br/></b>Every time the Troubler makes a statement about turning a celebrator, or a turned celebrator makes a statement about ruining the celebration, the Troubler takes a step toward the middle of the circle.<br/><br/>Every time someone with a role makes a statement that turns a celebrator back to helping, the Troubler takes a step away from the center of the circle.<br/><br/>If the Troubler makes it to the center of the circle, they immediately make a grand statement about how the celebration is ruined.<br/><br/>The a full pass around the circle (after the first round) happens, and the Troubler remains part of the circle, everyone with a role makes a grand statement about how the celebration was successful.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
