However, all of them know GUMSHOE, so I am also after playtesters who aren't familiar with GUMSHOE and like the sound of the background.<br/><br/>So, if you want to playtest please email simon@dyingearth.com.<br/><br/>I'd be really interested to hear your playtest experiences, both as publishers and punters, to see if we can improve the process.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331566/#Comment_331566" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T08:17:38+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  8:17AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks - we now have enough non-GUMSHOE-y playtesters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354319/#Comment_354319" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T09:15:51+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  9:15AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did it work out?

The players had the initiative and it was as far from railroading as possible.<br/><br/>The rules are clear, Hite really knows what he's talking about, and the spies vs. vampires theme is a match made in heaven.

Pre-order sales help us immensely.<br/><br/>I'll be running it myself in a couple of weeks, but it's been the most exciting read of all the GUMSHOE books we've done.

In contrast, when we do adventures, we get a lower response, but a greater response rate. For new games we spread the net quite widely - each new game is a chance to test the system, variations on the system, and the way we've explained it to novice readers as well as existing Pelgrane game players. For Esoterrorists 2.0 as a result of feedback, for example, we've added sections addressing what people imagine might go wrong with GUMSHOE as well as what can in actual play.<br/><br/>Night's Black Agents had a surprisingly narrow range of feedback, so there were few changes to the manuscript than, for example, Ashen Stars, where one section had to be completely rewritten as a result of polarised feedback.<br/><br/>The number of playtesters is also a good guide to how succesful a game is likely to be, at least in its first year, so it's looking good for Night's Black Agents. Other games, not so much.<br/><br/>We get additional feedback from our alpha customers in the pre-pre-order period which we also incorporate into the final ms.<br/><br/>If there is demand, I could release an entire set of playtest reports for one book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355658/#Comment_355658" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T02:54:37+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  2:54AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>If there is demand, I could release an entire set of playtest reports for one book.</blockquote>\nGod, yes, definitely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
