Sure,a ower Ranked PC can try to pull a trick on a higher Ranked one or try to switch the conflict to another Attribute, but there's nothing there to guide the GM when deciding whether or not that works.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the canonical example is Corwin backing Benedict into the Black Road, but if Benedict is really First Rank in Warfare he shouldn't have fallen for so simple a trick - should he?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about some other story games and re-reading the Amber books, and it occurred to me that one thing that Wujcik kind of skipped over is that all of the conflicts in the Chronicles between major characters have an element of "who's willing to push this the farthest" to them.  Most of the time nobody wants to outright kill anyone else, because, you know, family and all that.  They just want to force someone to the point of conceding something.  Of course, sometimes they really do want to kill or maim their brother...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I swiped some ideas from other games and came up with this.  I was hoping anyone familiar with the original ADRPG or the stories could provide some feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, build a Jenga tower in the middle of the play area (you can probably tell where I stole this one from).  In any PC vs. PC conflict, the higher Rank always wins unless the lower-ranked PC wants to try some kind of stratagem to change things up.  Maybe it's a trick, maybe it's a switch to a different Attribute.  Whatever.  To do that, the lower-ranked PC draws a block.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe higher ranked PC can then spot the trick/switch the conflict back/regain the upper hand by also drawing a block.  Continue back and forth until:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The tower falls.  The person who drew the last block loses, and loses <i>badly</i>.  Eyes burned out and thrown in the dungeon kind of badly.  At the complete mercy of the victor kind of badly.  The winner gets to narrate how you go down.<br/>\n2) You decline to draw a block.  You have to concede the contest, but you get to determine the terms of your concession.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT:  Addenda: the higher Ranked PC can decline to accept your terms and force you to draw a block, but if they do so, the conflict must continue until the tower falls.  If no one cares to narrate chnages in strategy, just alternate drawing blocks until the thing goes down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this would add a stronger sense of suspense, remove much of the need for a GM to arbitrate every single detail of a conflict, and provide some structure to the game's resolution mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure when the tower should be rebuilt - for each conflict, or only after it has fallen.  The latter would add a sense of rising action to the narrative, but I can see some odd artifacts from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?

I think this would mimic the pattern in the books, where the protagonists tend to spend the first little while poncing around in Shadow, setting things up, circling around each other, and then you come to a major inflection point like the Ascent of Kolvir.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only concern is that once the tower gets a bit tottery, any conflict could cause it to go down and then nobody's going to want to pull a block.  Of course, I can see players conniving amongst themselves to force two players into a conflict so the tower goes down and gets rebuilt, or agreeing secretly to start a conflict that topples the tower so they can offer easy concessions and start fresh with their real opponents...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that may be exactly what I'm looking for, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349952/#Comment_349952" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T14:28:50+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  2:28PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2011 2:45PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, nice to meet you, Daniel.<br><br>I had the exact same issue with Amber's resolution system, or more accurately lack of same.  The Jenga tower idea is neat (and I am perhaps unreasonably amused that we're adding uncertainty without using dice), but I'm not sure that adding a minigame is necessarily the right answer here.  I always really liked the way Nobilis handled this, by introducing resource allocation. <br><br>If you're not familiar with it, Nobilis PCs (which are usually demigod/demiurge types heavily inspired by Amberites and Sandman's Endless) basically compare their stat ratings to the difficulty chart to see what they can perform without effort (so if your stat is 3, you can freely and flawlessly do any related task of difficulty 0-3, all day long if need be), and then also have a pool of associated points that they can spend on a not-quite-1-for-1 basis to do something more difficult than that baseline.  Recovering those points is not trivial (though it's a little easier in the current edition), so there is still that element of "is this really worth tiring myself out over at the risk of getting bushwhacked later" and scoping out your opponents' abilities by how easily they can do this-or-that, and so on.  There's some other stuff that draws on your point-pools as well (for stronger-than-usual defenses, piercing other people's defenses, etc) to add other tactical concerns, but that's the meat of it.  I really like that method, because it allows for failure and uncertainty without making things hinge on luck or pure metagame, which I think is pretty essential to selling the feeling that these characters are a cut above mortal frailties.  You only fail if you miscalculated (which includes picking the wrong fight, or at the wrong time), or choose to take the hit.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349953/#Comment_349953" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T14:29:37+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  2:29PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2011 2:31PM by jenskot.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how conflicts are triggered in your game.

So, in my own sneaky way, I've been training my potential players by using The Trouble with Rose game which does not have a conflict resolution system (you tell stories with the intent to win the right to narrate the epilogue.)  <br><br>Against NPCs in Amber, it's a snap for the GM can tell the player to narrate/play out a scene where they win, lose, or draw.  After all, in Amber DRPG, combat <i>is</i> storytelling.  Just to pull something out of thin air, as the GM I'll probably do the secret note thing.  "Bob and Jade, secretly tell me how you plan to win and how badly you want to win." And then, right there on the fly (based on attributes, the situation, and how many wounds the player is willing to take), I'll determine the win/lose/draw and who gets the narration rights (the GM, Bob, Jade, or perhaps a spectator/player.)  With the outcome preordained, the storytelling commences and in the case of a draw (with possible damage on one or both sides) there's a chance for another round or two of battle.  You could totally do something like the duel between Montoya and the Dread Pirate Roberts that way with information reveals, stunts, etc.<br><br>Just my random thoughts which have been bubbling on a back burner for a while...<br/><br/>More thinkage, Amber has eight wound levels from near miss to death blow (be it physical, psychic, willpower, or warfare.)  When you're setting your stakes, you can easily declare how much harm you're willing to risk in exchange for knowledge of your opponent.  So the GM might say, "Jade, tell me how you learned that Bob is an Amberite while you trade close shaves."  <br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream" title="daniel_ream"><img alt="daniel_ream" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream">daniel_ream</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350052/#Comment_350052" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-30T12:22:47+00:00" title="November 30, 2011 12:22PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the randomness/twitchiness: yes, I fully realize I'm violating one of the core design conceits of Amber here :-)  I'm not so much looking to add randomness back in as I am to add suspense, and the feeling of risk when pursuing one's goals.  That's one reason the resource management mechanic doesn't quite work for me - it doesn't have the emotional punch ("Well, I'm out of stones.  I guess I'm screwed.")<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole "dextrous people will win more often" thing is certainly true.  In ADRPG's current form, though, the most persuasive/charming player will win more often.  While Amber is all about the You Are Your Character approach, I'd really like to drive a bit of a wedge between the two because I've run way too many ADRPG games where one really silver-tongued player completely runs roughshod over the others and it leads to group dissatisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Skype, I can't help you.

That's clumsy and ill-defined, but it's a start. It gives people a reason to narrate, something to shoot for.

Could you elaborate?</blockquote> Sure. Ask everyone to say, out loud, something that (1) their character is not competent at and (2) that they want to come up. You can phrase it constructively: "How would you like your guy to grow and change?" Then, when the time comes to mine the GM for favorable tags, the GM or another player can occasionally say something like, "Yes, that's a very creative way to try to narrate your First-rank Face-stabbing into a cooking reality show, but didn't we agree that your guy is always burning the roast? Maybe the face-stabbing can happen after he has this crisis, and comes face-to-face with his flaws?" Puppetland actually gives you permission to steer the story toward your puppet's, and your friends' puppets', things they can't do, just as surely as it it uses the things they can do, because that's how you pass the talking stick. You go from flag to flag. <br/><br/>Fudge, Everway, and a host of other games that preceded Puppetland didn't have its perspective on Drama as a mechanical paradigm, and that's not their fault. They had to come first. That doesn't mean that we can't incorporate its lessons into the earlier games when we play now.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the problem is character monogamy, character advocacy, and the idea that you have to protect your character to win. The whole hobby is built on a broken set of rules, where mere survival makes characters "better". That is boring and it abets the worst excesses of illusionism, and it feeds masturbatory power fantasies at the expense of a lot of other, and to my eye better, possibilities. But I write that and immediately it looks like I'm trolling or at least threadjacking, which is regrettable, so please don't respond in this thread.

That's one reason the resource management mechanic doesn't quite work for me - it doesn't have the emotional punch ("Well, I'm out of stones.  I guess I'm screwed.")</blockquote>\nI ran an Amber campaign (or, well, kind of three separate Amber campaigns that were really all part of one large story arc) for something like three years, and I've got to admit, it was difficult to make the characters feel threatened. I wasn't really into making the PLAYERS feel threatened, per se, but I did want there to be at least a little bit of suspense involved.<br/><br/>After that campaign ended I was working on something that involved using the attributes as resources, though that kind of fell by the way side. I think the main difference with what has thus far been suggested, though, was that in PvP action, I wanted the Attributes to be resources that you <b>secretly wagered</b> - not unlike in the initial Attribute auction. To your available wagering pool you'd add your Stuff total (which could increase or decrease it depending on whether you had Good or Bad Stuff). Then perhaps the GM could allocate additional points to a wagered action or set limits on bets depending on the circumstances (which could become greatly varied if other PCs or NPCs are involved, secretly or otherwise). If I recall correctly, an important thing about it was that even if you won the conflict, those points were still considered spent for the current scene, which meant that someone who's first in Warfare could go ahead and bet the farm and annihilate another PC, but If they were to become embroiled in a second conflict of Warfare that scene, it'd be over for them. I never really got to test it or properly develop it out though, those were just the ideas I had.<br/><br/>More recently I've been toying with the idea of doing an Amber/FATE mashup of some kind (which partially interests me because the guys who designed FATE did so as an answer to issues that had come up in their Amber campaign), but that's another topic for another time. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As far as the Jenga mechanic goes, I haven't had a chance to try out Dread yet, so I'm not completely certain yet how it would look. It sounds like an excellent way to build suspense, but one thing that does strike me is that it might work best for games surrounding narrative conflicts that everyone in the game is invested in - and in which you have the sense of a ticking time bomb. I've heard about someone using the Dread system to model Inception and it sounds like a cool idea in that respect (when the tower falls, the dream starts to collapse). So maybe you might want to reserve the use of the tower for things that might affect all the PCs, like maybe when they're using their powers or dealing with major players (although this also strikes me as something that might be especially cool to play with if someone is walking the Pattern...).<br/><br/>Either way, I'd be curious to know how your plan works out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350154/#Comment_350154" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T12:25:45+00:00" title="December  1, 2011 12:25PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about as an alternative to the Jenga Tower having them add a block to a tower.

(No, I don't always think about Amber in the shower... sometimes it's Deadlands...)<br/><br/>One possible way to alleviate the best-Jenga-player-always-wins problem would be to allow players who aren't as dextrous to designate someone else to pull for them. There's still tension because of the mechanic (albeit slightly lessened - though it circumvents the need to deal with a player crossing the line between experiencing a lot of tension and resenting the system because of it) and they have a chance against the other players.<br/><br/>The other idea I had is a bit more radical and is probably impractical because you possibly end up needing like half a dozen Jenga towers. The idea would be that each PC has his/her own tower from which they make their pulls. That could allow PCs to gang up on each other, conspiring to get a particular character's tower to fall. It would also mean those that put themselves forward the most risk the most on a very personal level. A bit odd, but just thought I'd throw it out there.<br/><br/>I'd also be curious to know if you'd have something special happen if a player knocks the tower over voluntarily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350243/#Comment_350243" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T21:20:34+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  9:20PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: otherdoc</cite>I'd also be curious to know if you'd have something special happen if a player knocks the tower over voluntarily.</blockquote>\nThat's losing on your own terms, yes?  :-)<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350248/#Comment_350248" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T21:36:09+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  9:36PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2011 9:40PM by Marshall Burns.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, man, this whole thing doesn't sing for me.

Every time you pull a block, you then have to place it on top of the tower.  Otherwise people could just pull from the top down, layer by layer, and the thing would never fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo some extent, I don't think there's any way around the "best Jenga player always wins" problem simply because there's equally no way around the "most persuasive/knowledgeable player always wins" problem.  By saying "we're playing Amber" we're also saying "this is a game for people who can BS and be persuasive and sneaky and cunning".  Unfortunately I have a lot of players who aren't very good at that sort of thing but would still like to play Amber.  So the Jenga mechanic levels the playing field a bit, as nobody has arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome or whatever.  I like the idea of a designated puller, and I don't think it would hurt the immersion too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarshall, I see what you're saying.  The tower isn't intended to replace the GM at all, just to take some of the "does this trick work" or "can the weaker opponent shift the terms of the conflict" decision-making out of the realm of complete GM fiat. In the case of <i>The Guns of Avalon</i>, Corwin arming his troops with firearms is a monumental advantage, and I would assume the GM would take that into account.  You could handle this by the GM granting one side of the conflict a certain number of "free" block pulls, although I think then we're getting right back to GM fiat again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis whole idea came out of an idle conversation, but I think I'm going to scrounge up some people to playtest it.  I will report back with the results.  On the off chance anyone with a regular Amber group would like to try it, I'd love to hear how it works for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350314/#Comment_350314" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T12:24:59+00:00" title="December  2, 2011 12:24PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's no reason the tower pulls need to be even. From what I understand of Dread, it's not a single tower pull every time you do something. To do risky stuff or stuff you're bad at or whatever, you pull multiple times, right?<br><br>So you could make it so that the character with the lower rank needs to pull 2 or 3 times for every 1 time that the person with higher rank pulls.<br><br>Also, you could use time limits. Give people like 10 seconds per pull or something. The handling time in Jenga can be kind of long. A timer could help reduce it.<br><br>Maybe a chess timer? I don't know how those work exactly, though. I never got that far into chess.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream" title="daniel_ream"><img alt="daniel_ream" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream">daniel_ream</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350315/#Comment_350315" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T12:37:55+00:00" title="December  2, 2011 12:37PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All very good ideas, Robb.

I feel your conflict resolution pain.<br/><br/>However, stopping the narrative to do Jenga really pulls me away from the tension and immersion that is so intense in Amber Diceless.<br/><br/>However, take <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=350314" rel="nofollow">Rob's idea</a> and apply it back to the original diceless system.....a PC needs to offer 2 or 3 'gimmicks' for every rank of difference in the person they are trying to overcome. If Corwin is 2nd rank, he needs to find a 3x whammy to be even up with Benedict.  He needs to 'make him furious' and 'use secret black grass trap' and 'distract him with story about daughter'.<br/><br/>Gimmicks like 'flash sun in his eyes' or 'feint that I am wounded' actually do not work on someone with a higher Ranking (you could rule that these are accounted for in the distance between ranks).  You have to introduce something new or specific to the story NOW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
