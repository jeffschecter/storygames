Is there anybody interested in playing an hangout game of Pride and Prejudice for two players?<br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/roberto-grassi/pride-and-prejudice-a-narration-game/hardcover/product-21755169.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lulu.com/shop/roberto-grassi/pride-and-prejudice-a-narration-game/hardcover/product-21755169.html</a><br/>A narration game for two players building a story around two characters, trying to push it in favour of one or another character by only using "pride and prejudice" statements.<br/>A nice and funny game of around 60 minutes (in case the players decide to narrate six scenes) or less.<br/>No predefined setting or characters. The story builds up through the players narration.<br/>Rob<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
