Perhaps the key is just that we all had buy-in to "telling a good story", trust that our fellow players were doing their best toward that end, and a compatible enough aesthetic sensibilities.<br/><br/>So, here are the relevant rules: <br/>- no primary character can die before the Epilogue<br/>- no character can die without their player's consent<br/><br/>And, here's the rest:<br/><br/>I chose two characters, Pierre and Bertrand.  I chose Bertrand to be my primary character.  However, other players' scenes got me more interested in Pierre.  By late in the game, I really was invested in how Pierre's story turned out.  I had some ideas for his history and motives that I hadn't gotten to share with the group yet, and I was hoping to get to these.<br/><br/>When it was Rob's turn to frame a scene for his character Arsende, he established that Pierre had raped Arsende years before.  I winced at that, but it wasn't hard for me to think about Pierre and incorporate "long-ago rape" into my concept.  Maybe this was because of dumb luck, or because I'm creative and flexible, or because Rob had done a nice job of reading me and the group and the vibe of the fiction to produce something amenable.  There was a rule that might have made a difference, too: Rob read out Arsende's 3 questions pre-play, and one of these was "Who took you by force at age 15?"<br/><br/>Jen was playing Pierre's rival, Bernard.  Bernard went to confront Pierre about the rape, drawing his sword.  (I can't remember whether this was on Jen's turn, or whether this was a branch off of Rob's scene.)  I enjoyed the scene, and portrayed Pierre's guilty conscience with half-hearted swordplay and losing ground.  The thing was, I didn't want Pierre to die before I got to show everyone my cool ideas for him.  We cut the scene as a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, subsequent scenes called for Bernard, creating pressure for us to go back to the fight and resolve it so we could move on unencumbered.<br/><br/>I would have been happy to let Pierre die and do the scenes I wanted for him as flashbacks, but I was obligated to spend my turns on my main character, Bertrand.  So, those flashbacks weren't going to happen.  <br/><br/>We resumed the fight on Jen's next turn.  She described the attack.  I described the defense, and how Pierre took a wound and fell to the ground.  Pierre begged for a moment to say his piece, and I looked nervously at Jen to see if Bernard would just skewer him.  Jen hesitated, so I started talking, basically spewing out my character ideas as a hurried monologue plea for a deathbed conversion and to honor my dead father by being buried with his coin which I had given to Arsende.  This was not super satisfying.  Maybe it could have been salvaged somewhat by playing through retrieving the coin or something... but Jen decided that Bernard was more enraged than anything else, so he struck, and I assented, "Pierre's dead."<br/><br/>Here's the other relevant authority: when Rachel framed a scene for her character Raimond, meeting with Garnier on the battle wall, she said, "Pierre's there too."<br/><br/>That's what happened.<br/><br/>I wondered afterward, "What if Jen had decided that Bernard wanted to imprison Pierre?"  Who gets to say whether that happens?  Jen, because it's her turn, and she decides what she wants for Bernard?  Me, because authority over Pierre tends to default to me as his player?  What if Bernard wants to imprison Pierre on Rob's turn -- does Rob decide what he wants for the story?<br/><br/>I should also mention the thought that led to this pondering: "How cool to play an RPG with no resolution system!"  It wouldn't be a stretch to characterize Montsegur as "vigorous creative agreement", a story-writing exercise in turns, and not a "game" at all.  All the feedback mechanisms are purely social -- if people are paying attention, looking pleased and entertained, saying "ooh, nice!" etc., then you're doing well.  This is probably my favorite way to play, as I have little patience for system mastery when trying to get my creative groove on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218085/#Comment_218085" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T13:48:29+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  1:48PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (long post eaten, to whit:)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I wondered afterward, "What if Jen had decided that Bernard wanted to imprison Pierre?"

If anybody else wants to take over, they can play a scene card to assume the Narration Right.  Or they can persuade the current owner to assent to their idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218114/#Comment_218114" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T15:42:06+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  3:42PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jason.  <br/><br/>In this session, scene cards were used often, but usually to tack on or embellish, never to circumvent or block.  I would have felt a little dickish using a card to stop the current Narrator from doing what they wanted so I could do what I wanted instead.  However, that might have been a result of the social vibe of this particular group.  I wonder if the game is still fun if there's more competitive narration-grabbing going on.

In the game that I played in at GPNW 2008 (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6647" rel="nofollow">Best Siege Ever</a>), it was not uncommon for you to be rolling along with your Narration Rights, setting something up, and then <i>swoosh</i> somebody drops a scene card on you and takes it in a whole different direction.  I found it cool, because it gave a whole different feeling to it than "let's tell a story together."<br/><br/>Generally I think the narrator restricted themselves to describing the outcome of events, and the actions of third parties. Essentially a mini-GM with fiat. Character reactions and actions were still the provenance of the player of that character.  I don't recall if the rules said anything about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218196/#Comment_218196" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T04:36:02+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  4:36AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that people tend to check in before totally interrupting or derailing with a big reveal.

I'm glad Montsegur 1244 played out well for you at Dexcon.<br/><br/>Tricky dilemma for you, wanting to switch main character during the game. It would be easy to say that you should just have sticked with your choice of Bertrand and have accepted that Pierre Roger would be a tool, not a main character in the game. However, I can imagine that it may have been difficult once you started get your head into Pierre Roger's story and motivations.<br/><br/>Jason is right about the rules questions - you can take it down to a battle of scene cards, but as they are so rare, you will often negotiate consensus with the group. <br/><br/>When playing story now and impro games I find it to be a major part of the fun that you can't plan too far ahead, but must be prepared for another player to bring the game/story in a new direction. Even if it means throwing away an entire story line by suddenly finding your character to be accused of rape, incest and other nastiness. The rule that a character can't die without the consent of the controlling player, should really be that a player cannot deprotagonize another players' character without the consent of the controlling player. However, I didn't want to try to explain that concept :-). It is essential that the players get to make the choices for their main characters.<br/><br/>The nice cliff hanger reminds me of the left for dead rule: Sometimes it will be better for the story if a character is left for dead rather than confirmed dead - this leaves open the possibilty that the character can reenter the story later, perhaps wounded, imprisoned, lost etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
