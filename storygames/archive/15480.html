It pertains to what I suspect is the most popular form of role-playing/story game play out there right now: System less IM and Forum RP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a lot of people who have never touched a tabletop RPG who love the hell out of this. And I don\u2019t really blame them, you get to invent a cool person and go on adventures and make up stories with friends! It\u2019s awesome and free!<br/>\n<br/>\nIT\u2019s massive, it\u2019s everywhere, and yet none of what going on out there seems to be filtering into gaming circles much. Every so often I\u2019ve seen someone pop up on RPG.net and get confused by what it is, and then there\u2019s a flurry of informing that person of How Wrong They Are, and nothing else really happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, does anyone have any experience in this field? Have any great stories to share? Reasons you like it, reasons you don\u2019t? Good ways to get into if you\u2019re interested?<br/>\n<br/>\nI confess, I have a little bit of experimentation that kind of went nowhere for very specific reasons. I\u2019ll post more on that later if folks want, but I want to see what other folks have to say first, before I risk putting off people from it with what I feel is a rather limited personal experience.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351099/#Comment_351099" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T14:22:09+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  2:22PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2011 2:22PM by Hans_c-o.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            nevermind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351102/#Comment_351102" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T14:50:27+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  2:50PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2011 2:50PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My wife and I met while roleplaying via the CompuServe RPGAMES forum 15 years ago.

There are a bunch of exceptions, though. I was heavily involved in an PBeM community called "World Weavers" before I discovered the Forge.  Ginger over on 20x20 has run a PBeM for years and years.  I'm sure there are others (like Chris Griffen, above).  Fred Hicks was huge in AmberMush, as I recall.<br><br>Unfortunately, I think, as with your RPGnet example, some of the "interactions" have often involved tabletop folks speculating (often in a pejorative fashion) about what all the freeformers and fanfic writers are doing, which has led to some less-than-productive conversations and contributed to the generally weak state of more freeform-oriented indie tabletop designs.<br><br>Do you have some specific things you actually want to talk about?

Ginger uses a heavily modified Everway for House of Cards, as I recall. Typical freeform RP rules are not mechanics; they're about who you can play, the etiquette of forum posting, and so on.

I've always been very curious as to the origin of freeform roleplaying on the Internet -- did it come from RPGAMES and PBeMs of the 80s, or is it an offshoot of fanfic with some pen and paper influence, or what?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351112/#Comment_351112" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T15:47:43+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  3:47PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2011 3:48PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've participated in many over the years (and posted about them here at various times.)  Here's my observations:<br/><br/>* Overwhelmingly, they are fan-based attempts at playing in the world, and normally with the characters (or at most one relationship removed from) of an established author.  Harry Potter, Twilight, etc.<br/><br/>* Overwhelmingly, the participants are teenagers or early 20-somethings.<br/><br/>* Volume of posting and length of posting are highly prized.  The person who can write a full paragraph about their character doing very ordinary things is highly regarded.  Good writing is discussed and valued.  Punctuation, grammar, etc. are all good things.  For a 16 year old, this is actually pretty amazing and encouraging.<br/><br/>* Overwhelmingly, the games are failures by the standards of those participating in them (I have some theories on this below). But the fun they have before the failure is considerable.  Therefore a lot of the fun of the game is writing incredibly detailed descriptions of characters, backgrounds, theme songs, celebrity pictures, etc.<br/><br/>* Conversations are very difficult to have, because of asynchronous posting.  The rest of the game can twiddle its thumbs while you and I pass notes in potions class.<br/><br/>* Conflict is very rare.  The characters rarely have strong goals or get in serious danger.  This is really difficult because the source material normally has very simplistic goal -&gt; opposition -&gt; conflict -&gt; resolution or status quo -&gt; danger -&gt; conflict -&gt; resolution structures.  We aren't talking about slice of life dramas here, we're talking about the world getting blown up by evil magic.  Yet it's pretty rare that people will actually write their characters into these situations - when they do, it's pretty difficult for them to work out how to meaningfully resolve them.<br/><br/>I'll give an example, I played on a Star Wars freeform play-by-forum game one time.  Literally 100 percent of the rest of the game was people playing Jedi padawans - a few had a second character who were Jedi instructors.  Until I got there, 100 percent of the game was the normal day of padawans and instructors on this idyllic planet, and people were getting bored.<br/><br/>I immediately made a rowdy starship pilot and my first post was my crap ship being chased by Sith starfighters who were mad because I had rescued a hot Twi'lek heiress from them, we crashed horribly and were in desperate trouble, pinned down.  I concluded the post with: "As the energy bolts rained down on their makeshift shelter, he checked the power pack on his blaster, then turned to the girl he rescued: 'You don't happen to have any juice for this thing, do ya?'"  The amazing rush to dogpile on this Thing That Was Actually Happening was both hilarious and fun.  Like, the whole concept of Something Happening was something the game desperately needed (Star Wars is not named Star Schoolwork), yet nobody felt they could/wanted to do something like that.<br/><br/>Most of the source material is pulp adventure/romance, which is highly formulaic, yet very few actually utilize the formula.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's a ton of good things about this - highly detailed characters, ENORMOUS character investment on the part of the participants, writing skills development, and so on, but there's a few things that keep tripping them up.<br/><br/>There's an interesting minority that are doing things like original settings and trying to put some kind of conflict...I wouldn't call them "mechanics" because that implies too much systemization, but some means of introducing it.  Don't think that my generalizations are describing everything that's happening. It's not.  But I can say this: The Kids Are All Right.  They're creative and having a blast and every time I peek in (very cautiously because I like to think of it as their space), I'm always impressed with something I read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351118/#Comment_351118" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T17:10:41+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  5:10PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for a thread objective, I'm interested in just trying to get a big scattershot set of information and anecdotes about the topic.

These games are organized by ship or space station.  Several ships or space stations are organized into a fleet of games.  The idea being that the organizers of several games can organize plotlines that span different ships, or a ship can go to a spacestation to refuel and the characters can cross over, etc.  This rarely happens in practice. <br/><br/>Again, the emphasis is on the creation of detailed/elaborate characters in the Star Trek world, then inhabiting them and their normal lives.  (With the "mission" exception, see below.)<br/><br/>They are often supported by an elaborate database program that has been developed (with several forks) over the last ten years.  So they tend to attract more technically oriented people and have a more age-diverse crowd.  The user interface is simple enough that anyone can use it, but it does take some work to set up/configure.<br/><br/>One thing I quickly discovered was that the goal of playing these characters was to play them to the ideal of what Star Trek characters should be.  For example, the way you get promoted in these games is by posting a lot.  Posting a lot (so long as it's well-written and punctuated, etc.) = making progress on the goals of the ship = in-character recognition.  When I asked "What if I make a guy who's a bit of a screwup, who goes down the wrong road, makes bad choices, shoots his mouth off, etc., would he get promoted too? That kind of takes the joke away." the response was "why would you make a character like that?"<br/><br/>The ideal, which many games don't ever get to (the number of Star Trek sims where the ship never leaves its "shakedown cruise", i.e. everyone meeting each other for the first time, is enormous), is seen in the "mission" structure.  Basically the game organizer posts up about a problem.  The organizer virtually is always playing the commanding officer, so the information is given in a briefing scene.  Orders are given (usually pretty general orders, like, 'go to this place and find out what's happening') and the characters go off to interact and achieve their orders.  The ideal is that they will discover what's going on and solve the problem.  Because there's no system, essentially it means doing what the organizer/CO said and they give you the information you wanted.<br/><br/>Actually this is not necessarily a bad setup for Star Trek (as the Ashen Stars GUMSHOE RPG recently demonstrated) because the important stuff in Star Trek is what people decide to do about the information and how they feel about it, not necessarily the information itself.  Unfortunately, because the idea of progress and "being the perfect officer" is built into the culture/reward cycle of the ST sim, it means that basically everything gets resolved more or less no matter what we decide to do.  ("If this wasn't the right thing to do, the perfect bridge crew wouldn't have decided to do it.")<br/><br/>I think with both the Star Trek sim and the yahoogroup/play-by-forum that I mentioned earlier, the main struggle is with the reward cycle.  If your reward is just being your favorite character, or interacting with your favorite character, or imaginarily occupying your favorite world, then a post where nothing happens is just as rewarding as a post where something really amazing or affecting happens. And "nothing happens" is easier and safer. Eventually, though, it becomes boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351229/#Comment_351229" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T06:47:02+00:00" title="December 12, 2011  6:47AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So let me try to give my impression of what it was like in the early days of chat-based forum roleplaying. This is from my CServe experience, but people playing in AOL's Zone have told me similar stories.<br/><br/>First off, imagine a place with hundreds and hundreds of players. At any time, you'll have 50-100 of them online in the forum. It's not unusual to have 20 people playing their characters in the same room (there was only one main room, The Tavern, with other rooms or private chats being secondary). Over half of these players were female, which for me, coming from an all-male RPG group, was definitely new. Many of them (including my wife Lisa, whom I met there) had zero tabletop experience.<br/><br/>You simply play by changing your user name to a character name, entering the room, and posting your description. Then you either draw attention of other players somehow, join into what's going on, or eventually slink out. The established rule of interaction is that you get to decide everything involving your character, including whether and how other characters' actions affect yours. I've said more about the pros and cons of that in the thread I linked to above.<br/><br/>Yes, there was a lot of flirting and romance going on, as well as plenty of cybersex behind closed doors, both in and out of character. But it was much more than that. It was a world full of PCs that created its own stories simply by bouncing them off each other. If you weren't logged in when your guildmate got turned into a vampire in the public room, you'd find out at some other inopportune moment later. Nothing was scripted or planned. It was all about playing your character and seeing what comes of it.<br/><br/>Sure, there were lots of frustrations with that. Dropped story lines, random chaotic events, no fixed setting or external stakes, personality conflicts, a dangerous closeness between player and character. But there were also so many amazing and beautiful story and character developments simply coming out of continued interactions of hundreds of player characters.<br/><br/>It's different now, because I haven't found such a massive and raw environment again. Lisa and I still play, but the site we play on has many fewer players. There is a lot more planning, and only a little of the beautiful productive chaos. It hasn't really held my interest very much, except for playing with Lisa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351232/#Comment_351232" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T07:02:20+00:00" title="December 12, 2011  7:02AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing in this by-post format for a number of years.  Since my 20s, in fact, when I met my wife via an <i>X-Files</i> game on AOL, of all places.  That had a chat component, so it wasn't strictly PBP, but I still kind of lump it in together.  A couple of years back I posted a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11053" rel="nofollow">couple</a> of <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11085" rel="nofollow">PBeM-related topics</a>.  And I actually still have a game that's been going on all that time, this one set in the <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> universe involving a few squads of Ultramarines.  Good times are had.<br/><br/>Jason is definitely right that a large part of the fun to be derived from these sorts of games has to do with character investment.  To use my 40K game as reference point: we spend as much time, if not more, getting into the head of my Ultramarine Sergeant as we do slaying Orks and neither of us consider that time wasted.  If it weren't for the character stuff, a lot of these games would simply evaporate because, as Jason also says, plot tends to be a distant second concern.  My Ultramarine's been fighting the same mob of Orks for two years now, which for some folks would be absolutely glacial plot progression, but we're still enjoying ourselves.<br/><br/>Continuity is a serious problem in the PBP/PBeM world, though.  My 40K is a radical exception to the general rule that PBP/PBeM games go kerflooey within two months, and often much earlier.  People are just getting settled into their roles when others start dropping out, all forward momentum is lost and... that's it.  I can't even begin to recall how many games I've been in that simply withered on the vine.  I guess the general lack of personal ties between players means that the sense of obligation a tabletop group often has \u2014 "We're all going to meet as friends every other week to play, okay?" \u2014 is completely absent, and that means walking away is that much easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351239/#Comment_351239" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T08:38:07+00:00" title="December 12, 2011  8:38AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like many of you met your current spouse in a chat room!<br/><br/>How does that... work, exactly?

The original one had you start in the Academy and handle a brief Training Holo-sim, and it was mostly a test of basic writing and following formatting ability. Passing didn't require much other than the ability to do those things. <br/>My longest running character was meant to be a little bit of the misfit, a lowly engineering ensign, who would cause as many problems as he would fix (dropping tools, breaking things, and injuring himself). I really saw this is an opportunity to write some fiction, and being in need of help, encouraging other characters to participate with me. <br/>Despite that, my character was quickly promoted for much the reason described above, the volume and quality of my writing (and perhaps my ability to draw in other players). <br/>What I discovered was that it wasn't so much that I wrote a lot that was the rationale behind the promotions (rewards) but rather the tremendous need for help. <br/>The ships typically had a couple dozen players, but only 4-5 of them would be "active" on a regular basis. The job of the senior officers, was to prod poke and cajole the less active players to post and get involved, or push them out of key positions. Many players got discouraged when they'd post into a scene only to get silence in return, and we'd lose a lot of players that way. <br/>So herding (very shy) cats was the senior staff's job. <br/>I did it well enough to get my own command and to basically co-run a sim (Typhon Station), but then my first child was born, and all that free time dried up. <br/>Interesting the games all tended to break up when that senior staff had different ideas where the story should go. Bad blood would ensue, and there would be a schism. <br/><br/>I never did play him as the perfect officer by the way. He was always screwing something up, being to slow with an order, or trusting the wrong people/aliens.

It was exactly as my good twin Christian describes; there was also a slightly-more-advanced mechanical resolution system called, if I recall correctly, Duel Of Swords (abbreviated as DoS, and sometimes there'd be side talk about "hey, why don't we DoS this conflict").  Besides everything going on in the public chat, there's lots of private messaging going on, discussing everything from how you see this or that conflict going to how badly you can't wait to meet in person and tear each other's clothes off.  <br/><br/>I met almost all of my romantic partners, up to and including my wife, online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351390/#Comment_351390" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T13:24:07+00:00" title="December 13, 2011  1:24PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2011 1:29PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>JD, when you introduced conflict to that Star Wars thing and they 'dogpiled' - does that mean they shut you down, defused the conflict, or that they rallied around it?</blockquote>\nThey rallied, swooped in and saved my big mouth space trucker, who immediately said "dang spoonbenders, I had it under control, why i otta" and then the hot chick he was travelling with said "shut up, he means thank you very much". It was pretty cool.<br/><br/>Edit: I remember another game that was set in the world of the video game Kingdom Hearts, which included many Disney and Squaresoft worlds. I had a character who was a Halloweentown resident, and as such I made a super-gross (green skin, giant nose, spiders living in hair) witch who was very nice. ("We're not mean" is in the THEME SONG for the world, after all.)  This was the opposite of the broody do-nothing types that inhabited the game from various Squaresoft game worlds. She would be very pleasantly offering live beetles to eat or mixing a potion with eyeballs or whatever. Big contrast to the rest of the game. And the interesting thing was...eventually she picked up a follower! Someone was playing a kooky catgirl vampire of some kind and she sent me a PM saying "we completely have to hang out". So we decided she was a niece (Halloweentown families are very open-minded) and so she would come bouncing along behind the witch whenever we would go off on some harebrained plan to solve a problem by doing something unbelievably inappropriate and horrible.  I kept telling her she needed to settle down with some nice monster, preferably someone with detachable limbs, so she could adjust him as need be.  "But auntieeeeee." It was funny.  I think my instinct is always to create a contrast in these games, to do something nobody else is doing. You might even call it trolling.  But I always love it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>I was having an in-character conversation with a vet, he was telling me that there were all kinds of jobs or things I could do in that world, and I narrated a gypsy girl stealing some of his jewelry, trying to get some conflict of some kind in.

If it's just "inhabiting this character that I ADORE in this world I'm SO ATTACHED TO", then engaging with the trouble is not any more rewarding than just chitchat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351392/#Comment_351392" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T13:38:05+00:00" title="December 13, 2011  1:38PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy crap.

Jamie, I'm sure the dude you ran into was playing for wish fulfillment. "I'm so awesome, yay! So rich, so powerful, so beautiful!" Very common. But not the only style. The trick was (is?) finding players who share your style. It's actually even harder to do this when you don't even have the basic "I like Vampire rather than D&amp;D" thing going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351433/#Comment_351433" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T03:57:00+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  3:57AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the online freeform scenes I played in way back (mostly chat rooms), if you were an "enhancement" player, you were highly prized. If you could put someone else over, make them look good with your descriptions, a lot of people wanted to play with you. <br/><br/>It was very improv. You could tell someone, "that spell causes your left hand to rot and fall off" and people would go with it. Very little blocking or instead of blocking, people would just quit and jump into a different chat. Another reason why enhancement players were prized. Player trust and reputation were huge.<br/><br/>I also found the focus was mainly on relationships rather than overarching plots. Lots of guilds. <br/><br/>There was also a lot of offline hooking up. <br/><br/>The play by post scene I was later involved in felt very different that the chat room scene. More like shared storytelling with more focus on verisimilitude and simulation while the plots were still less important and all over the place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
