We also talked about how being enthusiastic about your game was the basis of honest 'good' promotion. This got me thinking ...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we all agreed that being genuinely enthusiastic about your games helps get them noticed. However it strikes me that getting someone ELSE to be genuinely enthusiastic about your game actually might have more value. After all you have a vested interest in liking your own product whereas someone else is far less likely to have that same vested interest. It offers a degree of validation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that got me thinking about who would be the people who would carry the most 'weight' in that validation process. Whose opinion when saying 'Guys, I've read this and played a session or two and believe me, this game rocks HARD' is going to carry the most weight.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow in the real world we would court these people - I regularly offer free club passes to the students who I have identified as the 'social leaders' of larger groups of students so that I can tap into that mentality. I think thats a little dirty for the community feel that happens on sites like this and it indeed could make people start second-guessing the motives of people who are being pleasant with them or asking them advice about their game ... are they just fishing for a plug if I like it?!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich lead me onto podcasts and the influence they have. I listen regularly to Sons of Kryos, Durham 3, HGWT, Voice of the Revolution, Independence Insurgency and Masterplan (whisper me if I am missing a gem out there...!) and I get a LOT of my detailed pre-purchase knowledge of games from this avenue. In fact, a lot of these guys were high on my mental list of 'game champions' because of the nature of their medium.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think this presents a conundrum... we have people who can add substantially to the promotional bang of your product but we also have a community feel that we don't want to be shilling stuff to them just because they can do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my question is to the podcasters themselves - guys, what's the best way to get our games promoted on your shows?<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil<br/>\n<br/>\nps. No one is ever going to talk to me again in the same way after this, I'm convinced... &lt;grin&gt;                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123224/#Comment_123224" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T03:50:46+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  3:50AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2008 3:51AM by Clinton.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neil,<br><br>Hey, I can't speak for all of the Durham 3, but here's my opinion in respect to us: you can get a game promoted on our show by either getting us to play it (which we choose ourselves, so I guess that means convincing one of us you've got a game we'd enjoy), or talking to us in a way that we get excited about your game in context of one of our conversations.<br><br>In other words, we're not going to promote a game in the traditional sense of doing reviews, but we all get very excited about games, and if we're excited about yours, we'll promote it.

A slippery slope indeed ("Burning Wheel leads to The Sons of Kryos; The Sons of Kryos leads to Primetime Adventures; Primetime Adventures leads to Have Games, Will Travel; Have Games, Will Travel leads... to sleep deprivation").<br>\n<br/>\nAs a consumer of podcasts and potential consumer of games, actual play recordings are pure, digital-streamed gold.  I bought Don't Rest Your Head after listening to The Gamemaster Show and Spirit of the Century after Mel White's Virtual Play.  Paul Tevis' AP recording of Polaris has it high on my list but also informed me enough to talk to my group and find out that they are into the setting but that the story-telling rules intimidate them (and therefore I seek individuals who would be willing to give it a whirl).<br/>\n<br/>\nInterview shows are fun and a great insight into the creative process but the participants in the discussion are, by necessity, informed and the listener (and potential consumer) is commonly uninformed.  I guess a better way to say it is interviews sell the creator(s), not necessarily the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nReview shows are the best way for a listener to get snippets of insight into many different games.  It's the most direct form of new media marketing for publishers, but it is uncontrolled marketing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most remarkable phenomenons that makes an impact on listeners (well, me at least) is the way podcasters are fricken' jazzed after great games at a convention.  HG,WT and SoK both talk up con play experiences that make me need to get that game.  Star Wars, Episode L sold me on PTA and Burning Taft sold me on Mortal Coil (I think that's right...).  Try to corner podcasters at cons and ply them with food, drink and a great game session and you've got it made.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this contributes to the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWB                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123307/#Comment_123307" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T08:54:32+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  8:54AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I want Remi to paint my face on his naked body and...</blockquote>\nThank you for not finishing that sentence.

John, you would be a good subject.<br/>I want people to be friends with us, rather than try to get us to promote their games!<br/><br/>I believe the tattoo was retconned so that Remi can paint different opponents on his belly (this was in Food Holes, a Contenders eating contest hack).<br/><br/>And before I continue I need to sincerely apologize for screwing something up...<br/><br/>... it's not Remi, It's REMI: AMERICA'S ROLEPLAYER! <br/><br/>Also, Jason, first and foremost, I want to be your friend. You are an extremely interesting person to me. Actually, one of the things that made me immediately like you is your ability to clearly state what you don't want to do. For example, "Durham Three don't do playtests!" or when you clearly stated at the last Camp Nerdly that you loved it but would not be organizing the next one. It's a skill I admire. And one I often lack!<br/><br/>In terms of being friends rather than promoting, that's complicated for me. I play with a lot of people and even though I play with people that I am not actively friends with, I try to only play with people that I could be friends with if circumstances were different. That being said, one of my interests in organizing events and maybe one day creating art or writing games is to become connected to even more people that I could be friends with. It's certainly not about money. And I love money. But that's not why I am involved in RPGs. RPGs has brought be social bliss. It helped me break out of my shell. It taught my skills to GM my company and rise the ranks. It's connected me with my very best friends. And it introduced me to the love of my life. <br/><br/>To me, promotion is friend expansion. That's why I pick games at cons based on who is running them. Or buy books, regardless of content, based on who wrote them. <br/><br/>Different topic, in terms of talking about play, I always had the feeling from the indie game crowd that no one wants to read or hear about someone's play. And that it is considered tedious. My feeling was that even in Actual Play reports, it's often about revealing just enough to promote the game or identify what worked or didn't work. But to keep it brief because it's always on the verge of boring people. I could be completely off but that's always the impression I have had. It's sort of tied how I get the feeling that immersion (method acting play) and non conflict play are looked down on. Again, I could be completely off. These may all be trends that are slowly being killed, just like the idea that you must sell your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123310/#Comment_123310" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T08:59:37+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  8:59AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason said<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>I want people to be friends with us, rather than try to get us to promote their games! </i><br/>\n<br/>\nThats exactly the quandry I was thinking about, and <b>exactly </b>the reply that answers it.

They should be producing games that are smothered in goodness and thus - as a byproduct - attracting you to the awesome pot like little awesome seeking bunglemonsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, you don't do playtests  - but you do do the most brilliant play <b>experiences</b> and its that seething, exploding ball of enthusiastic WOW that makes the games seem so good and so ... buyable.

Then I mailed every podcaster I could find contact information for and said, "Hey, I'm doing a playtest, I have these audio spots, if you'd like to help me out, can you drop one in your podcast?"  I made sure to keep those spots short, punchy, and funny.  I made them as easy to get and use as possible.  I'd say about ten podcasts ran one of the spots, and I saw four or five additional playtests crop up (and these are actual playtests, not just downloads of the rules doc) and send me feedback.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure if the podcasting nation really wants to be deluged with 30-second spots emailed to them.  In fact, there's a very real reason I did it for the playtest and not for the release -- I find folks are way more willing to help you design a game than they are willing to help you sell a game.  I mean, you're basically asking for free advertising.  I don't know if any podcasters would be willing to run actual ads for released games, with or without compensation (run my ad and I'll send you a book?).  Alternately, one of the queries turned into an interview on the podcast, and that's also a good thing.<br><br>Still and all, at least for the playtest, I found this to be a very worthwhile strategy.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123318/#Comment_123318" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T09:07:29+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  9:07AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Different topic, in terms of talking about play, I always had the feeling from the indie game crowd that no one wants to read or hear about someone's play.

Sure, I suppose it does, but it's very much not why I do my show or the purpose of talking with my guests.  Of course, I also don't see why people who aren't designers listen to my show, but plenty do, so I'll just accept that they see something in my show that I don't. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>To answer your question, I'll talk about games if it's a design I know of and see as a positive example of some particular goal or execution, and I'll talk about games with my guests if they can relate talking about their games to a focused advice topic.  I take the stance that if you hear about a game on my show, you've probably also heard about it elsewhere, so you've probably already heard about why you might be interested in it.

Likewise, if you have a game that matches one of the locations I feature, or one of the themes of a particular location, I'll mention it and perhaps review it if I can. It's pretty much about being able to tie it to the niche that my show covers.<br/><br/>2- The Digital Front: I do interviews with e-publishers here, and that includes pretty much all the folks here with PDFs at IPR et al. I already did one with Fred and look forward to doing more (once I get my but in gear). The angle is very specific, however. Aside from the interview, we run a review section for an e-product, but it is a straightforward review. Occasionally I'll insert a personal opinion after the review, especially if I have a strong opinion on the game (positive one, we don't badmouth anyone, preferring to just not do a review). This one is more industry-y in tone, so it doesn't have a lot of that fanboy-ism that drives sales, but if it helps, we're here to help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123366/#Comment_123366" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T10:28:28+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 10:28AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay to Matt interviewing Clinton - judging from posts of his here and elsewhere there seems to be a story to tell!<br/>\n/Peter                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123506/#Comment_123506" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T15:27:38+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  3:27PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prove to the podcasters you're listening to them.

It's a niche of a niche, of course, and not everyone wants to listen to other people playing games, but we dip into quite a few story games and we've had very good feedback from listeners. For one thing we're not looking to tell people how to improve their gaming, we're just fumbling our way through new systems and old, having a laugh and making the sort of crappy jokes you'll hear at a thousand gaming tables.<br/><br/>Perhaps because RPGMP3 began with <i>D&amp;D</i> as its focus a lot of the listeners have very little experience of story games and "small press" releases, so it's been interesting introducing these guys to new options. The fact that so many gamers seem to know almost nothing of even the biggest indie games does suggest that there are worlds to be conquered in terms of advertising and communication, but we don't actively promote anything. Reviews are informal, in-game mostly, so in our case there's little extra that a designer could really do to push his product via our recordings except perhaps posting to the forum. Game designers can't be everywhere, of course, and posting on every forum just to chase an extra sale or two is likely to be exhausting, but sometimes it's nice to know that people are willing to say hello.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123513/#Comment_123513" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T15:53:33+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  3:53PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Winterbear</cite>Try to corner podcasters at cons and ply them with food, drink and a great game session and you've got it made.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nI, for one, approve of this tactic.<br/><br/>But seriously, my standard response to folks (and mostly, companies) who want to send me review copies is "If I'm not totally stoked about the game after reading and/or playing it, I probably won't talk about it on the show."

A slippery slope indeed ("Burning Wheel leads to The Sons of Kryos; The Sons of Kryos leads to Primetime Adventures; Primetime Adventures leads to Have Games, Will Travel; Have Games, Will Travel leads... to sleep deprivation").<br/><br/>As a consumer of podcasts and potential consumer of games, actual play recordings are pure, digital-streamed gold. I bought Don't Rest Your Head after listening to The Gamemaster Show and Spirit of the Century after Mel White's Virtual Play. Paul Tevis' AP recording of Polaris has it high on my list but also informed me enough to talk to my group and find out that they are into the setting but that the story-telling rules intimidate them (and therefore I seek individuals who would be willing to give it a whirl).<br/></blockquote>\nI'm with Robin on both points. Mel White's Virtual plays are great, and there's a fantastic Burning Empires game - Prometheus Chained - that I started listening to try to figure out how that game's scene structue played out for real, and kept listening to because it was just a damned compelling story <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Actual play threads are golden, but actually listening to play going on, and learning how games are meant to play, is the next best thing to getting a demo. I can't help think there must be some way to use YouTube or something similar to get the same effect.<br/><br/>But I have to give props to Judd Karlman for evangelising his arse off for the past four or five years and pretty much singlehandedly dragging my attention away from the stuff I already knew about and loved (let's call them trad games, to pick an otherwise meaningless distinction) and towards all these other great games that I've come to adore. I'd say a hell of a lot of gamers - especially ones like me who aren't based in the US, can't get to the big cons to see the New Thing and can't sit down for a demo from the designer - followed the same or similar path.<br/><br/>If i have a point here, it's probably that it's worth designers considering that their audience may come to them through unexpected avenues, and cast their net accordingly wide.
