I briefly mentioned how my early '80s gaming group chose the Vietnam War as our war of choice because it was still so close to our experience; my father and uncle both fought there.<br/><br/>But what if you want to get at the heart of an historical war by ahistorical means?  Getting back to the Vietnam example, what do you think of depicting that sort of low-intensity guerrilla warfare in an SF or fantasy setting?  I'm thinking about the Misty Waters section of the PS2 game, <i>Killzone</i>, in which the heroes head into a mangrove swamp and basically do a three-man sweep-and-clear operation against the Helghast.  It's a Vietnam scenario in all but name.<br/><br/>Do you think it cheapens the original conflict to approach it in this way?  The more I think about Vietnam gaming I suspect more and more that it would have to be dealt with allegorically rather than straight, mostly because simply saying the phrase "Vietnam game" is going to turn off a significant portion of the gaming population.  There's just something about that war that turns people off, or maybe it's idea of playing any historical conflict where real people died.  You saw some of that blowback when <i>Afghanistan d20</i> was released.<br/><br/>So is an allegorical method more conducive to successful gaming, divorced as it is from issues of propriety?  Or are we better off simply having our wars as they were?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248955/#Comment_248955" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T06:19:15+00:00" title="December 29, 2009  6:19AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about any allegorical anything, but playing wars in fictional places that are just real places withe the numbers filed off is an old tradition among minis gamers.<br/><br/>The reason is more one of practicality than anything else: With a fictional place, any result can happen.

To the extent that the parallel is obvious, it can be regarded as kind of tendentious: you can be read as arguing that "this is how it was in the real world" without having the courage to actually come out and say it, because if you're called on it you'll just go, "Oh, but <i>this</i> is fiction."<br/><br/>I think if your intention is to re-create a historical war--or a historical situation of any sort, really--you should have the courage to play it straight. J.R.R. Tolkien is on record as having a "cordial dislike" for "allegory in all its manifestations." Fantasy or sf shouldn't be a thinly veiled real-world situation; the fictional situation should emerge from the postulates and what-ifs you've established about the fictional world you're trying to create.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248963/#Comment_248963" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T06:52:27+00:00" title="December 29, 2009  6:52AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using a hidden scenario absolutely does not cheapen a setting. In fact it allows the players to come at it fresh - sans prejudice.<br/><br/>I love using Sci Fi settings for modern asymetrical war games. The space marines in fire base Betty are over run by bugs. It expresses the attitude we humans take when we dehumanize "the enemy" without having to dehumanize the enemy.<br/><br/>I play British Colonial Miniature games set in the Sudan in the 1880's, so British versus Muslims. On the one hand I love England (I've got some British ancestors) but I'm also a Muslim so I'm torn. As long as the Sudanese have a chance I'm interested but if it is just a turkey shoot I'll pass. Of course I know that in the long run the British didn't win in the Sudan (evidence - in the 1980's Independent Sudan reinstituted Sharia law (for particularly horrible and stupid reasons. When Assholes administer the law it doesn't matter what law is used it isn't good.) In the end the Muslims don't have a chance in a head on fight. If the scenario was hidden I would not get the fun of this kind of navel contemplation but it also wouldn't pull up modern day politics.<br/><br/>So hide your game as you want to.

It's a game about the Opium Wars. The British sent gunboats and soldiers into China, because they wouldn't buy our opium. There were various atrocities: particularly nasty was the sacking of the Summer Palace, in which we destroyed a beautiful palace, and the treasures it contained, to assert our superiority. (I'm simplifying these events slightly, but that's not a bad summary).<br/><br/>Now, you couldn't just write a game about being British soldiers in China, committing atrocities. It'd be horrible. So, instead, Forbidden City takes place in a allegorical dreamworld, called the Smoke-Filled Land. There are references to Chinese myth. And you go through this beautiful land with a gun, which lets you destroy things.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect game, by a long shot, but it does do that allegorical thing you're talking about.

Bored of the canned scenarios in the book, we decided to set up an armored column ambushed by infantry in a Stalingrad-type setting (we also had the benefit of a roomful of beautiful ruined city terrain and armies painted by a master-class painter). We had a great battle, and the connection to history added a little depth and interest to the game. Afterwards, my opponent told me a story of talking to his grandfather, who was part of a German tank unit in WWII, and how his grandfather impressed the horror of war upon him.<br/><br/>The lesson to me? Gaming can 100% be connected with reality. On the other hand, both my opponent and I brough something to the table about how we understand war. The game itself does nothing to reinforce this. You can play Warhammer 40k for years and never get beyond the vauge and misleading message of "war is really cool".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GM_Withdrawal" title="GM_Withdrawal"><img alt="GM_Withdrawal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GM_Withdrawal">GM_Withdrawal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249005/#Comment_249005" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T12:10:06+00:00" title="December 29, 2009 12:10PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2009 12:11PM by GM_Withdrawal.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the war through allegory is going to depend on what your objective is. On one hand no one's uncle died fighting swamp elves so they're going to enter into that game without the emotional baggage they would bring to a game about fighting the Viet Cong. Considering this is done for entertainment, this might allow the players to explore different roles than they would fill comfortable with otherwise. If I play a grunt in the king's army, and I throw an exploding potion into a swamp elf hut, I as a player, am going to be more comfortable than if I'm playing a private using a flamethrower to light up some poor smuck's home. <br/>\nHowever, if your objective is to examine the effects off this particular conflict than you really need to be willing to face it head on. A game about vietnam and the consequences should be set in vietnam not on the planet Mantiev. <br/>\nIn conclusion if you want to explore a specific element of history, be it D-Day, the Tet offensive, or the Chosin Reservoir play that, but if your goal is to explore something like asymmetric warfare vs. a superior opponent or uppity natives vs. imperialistic oppressors I believe these could just as easily be explored in some sort of allegory without the potential drawbacks of using real history. <br/>\nOne last point is that there is a world of difference between a game set in the Iraq War and during the 100 years war. Realistically while people might have connections and patriotic opinions of the latter they are going to so much less than the former it might as well be a fantasy setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249007/#Comment_249007" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T12:35:03+00:00" title="December 29, 2009 12:35PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot depends on what you mean by "getting to the heart of" the war.<br/><br/>I wouldn't bother using allegory as a way of getting past issues of "propriety" (like Jason, I'm reluctant to take the horror out of war - I like much more the reaction of the narrator in _The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao_, who gets beat up and swears never to write another fight scene).  That said...<br/><br/>1.  It can be a way of getting past knee-jerk reactions.  If you say, "let's do Vietnam," people have pre-conceived notions.   When I ran my thinly-veiled Rwandan genocide in my Eberron game it was in part a way of breaking past the fact that everyone thinks they already know what should have been done, and getting them to think about how to react.  Somewhat to my surprise, it worked so well that the PCs mostly ignored cries for help and one even consciously participated in part of the slaughter.<br/><br/>2.  It can be a way of focusing on what's interesting to you without loading people down with detail, especially people who aren't experts on the game.  My Liberia peacekeepers Unsung scenario is set in Equatorial Kundu.  This lets me run the scenario without risking it turning into a class where I teach people about Liberia, beyond the elements I want to focus on.  In other words, it can make it easier to "get to the heart," if you've decided what the "heart" is.<br/><br/>3.  It can let you combine elements of different conflicts in interesting ways, or (the converse of 1, in some ways) bring a war "home" in a way it might not be.  My favorite example of this is Brian Wood's comic book, DMZ - it's the Iraq war (basically), but it asks the reader, "what if this were happening in Manhattan?"<br/><br/>4.  Similar to 2, it can give you the ability to flesh out a totally fictional war in a way that has some versimilitude.  I use what I know about African conflicts a lot when running games that involve wars just because filing the numbers off the CNDP gives me a rebel group when I need one that's more complex and interesting than a random one I might make up.<br/><br/>One problem with the propriety thing - and, though I've used it, with use 1 - is that it can risk rubbing people's noses in things, hoodwinking them a bit.  If someone doesn't want to play Vietnam because they feel strongly about it, and you throw them at swamp elves, it may be a bad scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249027/#Comment_249027" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T14:14:39+00:00" title="December 29, 2009  2:14PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to make a distinction between "allegory" and what I'll call "homology" (i.e., structural similarity) in the relationships between historical and fictional worlds. In allegory, the logic of the situation is that of a fable, in which characters are purely figurative--they represent something else. So <i><b>Animal Farm</b></i> isn't  a speculative fiction exploration of what if barnyard animals tried to govern themselves, and no one takes it as such. They recognize it as allegorical, in which the pigs <i>stand for</i> something else--in this case, the revolutionary elite who upon achieving power arrogate unto themselves its perquisites: "Some animals," we learn, "are more equal than others," and in that hypocritical epigram is the moral of the story. <br/><br/>Homology, on the other hand, emerges in situations where an author imagines how the operation of social, political, economic, and other forces affects conditions in the fictional world; to the extent that those forces parallel those in operation in particular historical circumstances, resemblances emerge. This can be done self-consciously for exactly this homological effect. So Asimov <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series" rel="nofollow">creates a Galactic Empire</a> that in some ways resembles the Roman Empire because of its centralization of authority and so forth, but it's not an exact parallel, and it's not the case that we are meant to read the Foundation as the Roman Catholic Church or the Royal Society or any such thing.<br/><br/>So allegory has its place, but I'd argue that it's bad news for fantasy &amp; science fiction, along the lines of Tolkien's argument, which as I understand it distinguishes between allegory as the author's attempt to impose meaning upon a narrative and interpretation as the reader's right to make sense of it on his or her own. So the negativity with which some of us respond to a hypothetical proposal to base a campaign around hurling fireballs at elusive swamp elves in which it is made clear--perhaps by conventions of naming or details of culture--that they are stand-ins for the Viet Cong may be a product of that attempt at imposing a specific meaning on the situation, rather than allowing an interpretation to emerge organically from the specific details of the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249038/#Comment_249038" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T15:15:12+00:00" title="December 29, 2009  3:15PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2009 3:16PM by Brian_Minter.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, that was elucidating, thank you (homology v. allegory).<br/><br/>This is something I have always tried to do with my gaming, especially in D&amp;D, when I did more "creating the story". Taking historical situation (like, say, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the U.S. involvement therein), and replacing the real-world cultures with fantasy equivalents. <br/><br/>I'm not sure I'd call that "creepy" either, but I'm not quite able to explain why I find that preferable to actually gaming the real-world history in some fashion. <br/><br/>I'm gonna go with Bill's idea that it constrains the development of a "new" story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
