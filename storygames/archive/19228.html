However, other aspects of this style of play weigh in heavily on the living, fictional aspect of the game: the fiction should matter, and the details should feel weighty.<br/><br/>Some of the odds are very explicit in this style of play (for instance, you might know exactly whether your character will level up after killing a certain monster, or what her odds of finding a secret door are); other things are designed to be hidden from the players (like certain types of rolls for the monsters, or a check made to find traps), so they can remain in the dark along with their characters.<br/><br/>There are a lot of variables here:<br/><br/>Where can we increase uncertainty in order to put the player in the same mindset as the character?<br/><br/>For example, I've heard of a game where the character holding the map to the dungeon fell into an underground river. The Dungeon Master running the game took the players' map and carried it into the bathroom, where he let water run over it for a few minutes, and then brought it back to the table. Could they still read any of it? This was part of the challenge now.<br/><br/>Here's another example:<br/><br/>In most OSR-style games, every player knows quite precisely his or her character's hit points. However, the game could be more scary or atmospheric if they did not: what if the GM kept track of the PCs' hit points?<br/><br/>This kind of uncertainty increases the challenge for the players, potentially adds some drama/fear into the equation, but, generally, also puts more work on the shoulders of the GM.<br/><br/>Can you tell us about a situation where you had to deal with this kind of issue in a game (anything vaguely OSR-ish is fine for the purposes of this thread), and how did it turn out? Why did you make the choice you did, and what were the effects?<br/><br/>How much uncertainty or "fog of war" do you include in this style of play, and where is it better to leave everything out in the open?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428425/#Comment_428425" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-19T19:31:18+00:00" title="February 19, 2014  7:31PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So our whole game is a fog of war.

Uncertainty creates a curiosity and <i>excitement</i> of finding out stuff, while <i>challenge</i> comes from the player making an effort.<br/><br/>\xd7 To don't know what's behind a door is uncertainty.<br/>\xd7 Knowing that there is a dragon behind a locked door and rolling for lockpicking the door is uncertainty.<br/><br/>\xd7 Solving a puzzle to overcome a locked door is a challenge.<br/>\xd7 Making the player playing chess against the dragon is a challenge (and uncertainty - you don't know if you're going to win).\n<blockquote>Where can we increase uncertainty in order to put the player in the same mindset as the character?</blockquote>\nIt's all about how you present the information. One thing I liked about <b>D&amp;D4</b> was the bloodied rule. That was a great in-game mechanic for telling the condition of an opposition without having to say the numbers. If you don't want to reveal the hit points then you need to describe it in another way, otherwise you're removing information from the players that the characters should know about.<br/><br/>One technique I like, that's actually fog of war, is having the map on the table and a another paper on top of it with a hole in it. The players can move the top paper to see through the hole and that's where the characters are traveling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428438/#Comment_428438" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T04:47:26+00:00" title="February 20, 2014  4:47AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an old thread, if you can find it, Eero talks about his primordial OSR and "hygienic" dungeoneering where he describes how he leverages uncertainty in the game-world by  altering the flow of verbal, descriptive information given to the players based on their actions.

It's not the case that reducing information always leads to lack of agency (which I understand to be behind Rickard's thesis here). Sometimes it does, when you know so little that you can't make any choices, and therefore might as well flip a coin. However, other times lack of information is a key element in a challenge.<br/><br/>Most significantly, D&amp;D is a game of risk-taking. It's not like Chess, you're not <i>supposed</i> to be able to operate in an even field of tidy tactical movements and well-known certainties. Gambling, guts, correct evaluation of risks, choosing decisive action vs. hedging, these are all <i>virtues</i> in D&amp;D, where you can lose just as much by excess care as by bold action. This would not be the case if the game guaranteed information and fairness and that there would always be a correct solution to events. Sometimes there are no correct solutions except to minimize your losses.<br/><br/>This positive and creative side of uncertainty comes up for me a lot in my observations about the way challenges are identified and negotiated in D&amp;D. Challenge-negotiation is a process that cuts through every strategic level to the most tactical, and it's essentially the same in every case: a player considering whether they dare cross a room to grab a treasure is in a similar relationship to the GM as the player who is considering whether the party should journey to the highlands to answer the call of a duke in distress. And in both cases the unknown is just as important as the known.<br/><br/>I have mostly written against lack of information, because in my experience D&amp;D sometimes has a tendency toward too much of coin-flipping: when you have two doors, and behind one is a ferrari and behind the other are giant bees (to paraphrase a well-known Gygaxian koan), and there are no hints, no cultural background data, not even the knowledge that there could be giant bees in this dungeon... that's pure coin-flipping, and no longer challenging. If you have to, at least tell the players in advance that there'll be giant bees after a wrong choice, so they may stock up on antidote if they can.<br/><br/>However, not only lack of information is problematic, but too much information is also bad, because it privileges player expectations and gives them false confidence in their choices. Specifically, my experience is that when players consider it their prerogative to have full and complete knowledge of the choices they're making, they lose their ability to accept the inherently chaotic nature of life (and thus, D&amp;D). This is not a healthy attitude to have, for the nature of the game is such that sooner or later your information will fail you, even with the most open-handed refereeing style. The only way to avoid this would be to move to a game where you actually give the players your adventure notes in advance, so that they could never be disagreeably surprised.<br/><br/>I'll leave discussing concrete information management for later, I've spent too much time talking D&amp;D today as it is. Besides, there seem to be ample examples of good ideas here, I could get behind most of this stuff for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428492/#Comment_428492" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T12:52:09+00:00" title="February 20, 2014 12:52PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points so far from everyone.

Uncertainty, decision and effort are like sweet, acid and bitter. You can't increase one to get more of another. What you can do is to exclude one to make another take more place, or make a good combination of sweet, acid and bitter will make the dish taste good. In gaming, excitement comes from uncertainty, tension from decision and challenge from effort. Games have a combination of these, and I feel personally that it's important to realize that these three foundations exist and to keep them apart; to use the strengths of each one of it's own before you later combine them. So when I read "Increasing Challenge through Hidden Information", all I see is "How can I increase the sweetness by adding bitterness?". It does not compute for me. All you can do is to combine them to create a result.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428524/#Comment_428524" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T21:08:48+00:00" title="February 20, 2014  9:08PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2014 9:09PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Crunch">@Crunch</a>: Thanks!

But the players can also decide which ratio of those three things they like, and, in this case, they can expend more effort to try to reduce the uncertainty - which is a challenge. Maybe this is an illusion, I don't know. But what I'm curious about in this thread is what it feels like in play, for the players. I'm not so interested in the theoretical discussion (although I think it's a worthwhile one for another time). If the answer is that the feeling of uncertainty is increased, but not the sense of challenge, that's a data point. Has that been your experience in D&amp;D/OSR-style games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428598/#Comment_428598" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T20:34:52+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  8:34PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2014 8:35PM by Lee_Short.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Great points so far from everyone.

But I was thinking about the Hidden and Revealed Information in relation to the role of the DM and "illusionistic" practices - namely that the illusion game is all about controlling information the players have. I scoured my on DM habits for times I kept information for them and found that, yes, abuses occurred and generally negative experiences happened but on the other hand I found the same strategy deployed regularly to usually positive effect (or, like, effects congruent with D&amp;D warts-an-all). <br/>Examples include secretly rolling for Wandering Monsters, Surprise, Reactions, Monster/Treasure generation, secret doors, trap activation, morale and so on - pretty much everything that's suspenseful for the players not to know immediately. My rule of thumb is to reduce the time between my secret roll (loudly broadcast with "furtive" die-clattering) and when the information is given to the players. This is the tabletop equivalent of a horror movie suddenly bringing in suspenseful music to signal a sudden immanent threat. My feeling is that this peek-a-boo conceal/reveal act is a great tool in the DM's tool box but it can't be prevailed upon to be entertaining alone.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
