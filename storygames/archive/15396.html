The dictates and randomness of the mechanics combine to both inform these decisions and to provide their outcomes in terms of deaths, injuries, and major or minor changes to the character sheet.  So, in one respect, the rules tell you how your choices work out for you.  But the number of injuries and new Traits isn't the biggest part of that answer.  The biggest part is often, "How does that work out for the town?"  Did you kill, injure, and back down from the right people?  Or, in trying to do good, did you just leave a community devastated?<br/><br/>That's pretty much on the GM, isn't it?  To either say, "The surviving villagers are ecstatic that the problem has been dealt with," or, "The villagers hold a solemn funeral and pray that they never see Dogs again, vowing to solve their problems on their own," or, "There's enough resentment and anger in this town that you must decide whether there'll be more bloodshed if you stay and deal with it, or more bloodshed if you leave."<br/><br/>Hopefully the entirety of play informs the GM's decision.  So the players still had input.  But in the end, it's the GM's call, right?<br/><br/>Same on the smaller scale.  When you kill the girl's abusive lover, does she thank you or attack you?  I mean, before she does anything, you've still got your own feelings about what you just did.  But that's not Theme yet until it ripples out into the world around you and resonates back, via NPCs.  And the GM controls the NPCs.<br/><br/>What's my point?<br/><br/>I don't have one yet.  I'm just trying to understand how Dogs works in this respect.  I'm not convinced that the above is correct.  So, what do y'all think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349384/#Comment_349384" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T16:55:41+00:00" title="November 21, 2011  4:55PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2011 4:56PM by jenskot.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>When you kill the girl's abusive lover, does she thank you or attack you?

And the GM controls the NPCs.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure what theme means here but I can talk about player vs. GM narrative control using your example.<br/><br/><br/>- Sarah (NPC) is abusing her husband Bob (NPC). The GM creates this situation using the Town creation rules.<br/><br/>- A Dog (PC) kills Sarah (NPC). The Player creates this situation using the Conflict rules. <br/><br/>- Bob (NPC) could react in many ways. He can thank the Dog, attack them, or anything. The GM decides as they feel is appropriate. <br/><br/>- But, the Dog (PC) could convince Bob (NPC) that killing Sarah (NPC) was for the best. The Player creates this situation using the Conflict rules. Say Bob's reaction is at Stake, win, and say how Bob reacts.<br/><br/><br/>The GM has a lot of control but that control can be taken away by the Players using the rules. The GM is allowed to narrow or broaden what is at Stake. "Before you can convince Bob that what you did is right, you first need to help Bob who is in a state of shock." But ultimately, if you want to push, you have an opportunity to manipulate how an NPC reacts. <br/><br/>I don't know how that changes or doesn't change your idea on who controls the theme. But hopefully it is a useful data point on your journey!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349385/#Comment_349385" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T17:00:52+00:00" title="November 21, 2011  5:00PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2011 5:03PM by Jesse.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my Theme equation:<br/><br/>Theme = Audience Reaction To: Protagonist Decision &amp; Action + Outcome.<br/><br/>So the GM contributes to Theme in dogs but he can't control it because of many levels.<br/><br/>1) He can't control the Audience Reaction (i.e. the other players feelings and sometimes not even his own) in any kind of calculated way.<br/>2) He can't assume control of the Protagonist Decision &amp; Action part of the equation.<br/>3) He can only sort of *shade* the outcome in that he certainly does provide the NPC's judgments and reactions.<br/><br/>But the NPCs reactions and judgement do not define the theme.

In my experience, I'd say the ratio has varied.  Sometimes, my audience reaction was based primarily on that thing I just decided my guy would do!  But other times, my audience reaction has been very much based on outcomes that were largely about NPC reactions.<br/><br/>Marshall,<br/>What happens to my Dog might <i>be</i> all about what happens to the town.  The GM can't determine that my guy will <i>care</i> about being run out of town for being a crappy justice dispenser.  But if <i>I</i> already know that my guy will care, then the GM's call on that is huge in handing me my takeaway.<br/><br/>John,<br/>Good point.  Getting the GM's judgment of an NPC's reaction doesn't forcibly end the conversation.  "Hey, wait, you think I'm a crappy justice dispenser?  I'll talk you out of that!"  And then we go to the dice.  From that perspective, the GM's job is to dictate Theme-if-no-one-intervenes.  But you can intervene, so, cool.  <br/><br/>I haven't seen that happen, though.  Have you?  I mean, I've seen plenty of persuasion conflicts!  But I've never seen a dramatic NPC reaction to a player choice followed immediately by a, "No, don't take it that way!" conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349403/#Comment_349403" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T19:16:27+00:00" title="November 21, 2011  7:16PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2011 7:17PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In just the ordinary everyday walking around normal version of "theme", the theme is established when town creation is complete, so yes, the GM does control theme in Dogs.<br/><br/>But to answer the OP's question, yes, the GM does decide if the town blows itself to pieces and hates everything the Dogs do, but it's the Dogs that decide what's justified or not.

But the important thing about Dogs is that every action they do is justified, whether they feel it or not (and even if you make a character who feels it, the player certainly won't).  Shoot the Steward in the head before he says a word? Justified. Pardon the sorcerer and claim they're actually practicing the faith? Justified.<br/><br/>It is about what happens to those around him, but their stories are not important. The Dog's stories are important. Giving their reactions and responses is critically important to drive conflicts and resolutions, and there's certainly some theme work there (this husband gives in when the Dogs come for his wife, this son escalates with all he's got when the Dogs come for his mom). But what happens to the town after the Dogs leave is unimportant.  Unless you want it to be. You could always have the Dogs return to that town at a later time, and find another mess, possibly one made directly as a result of their actions. But it's still about the Dogs, their past decisions, and what they're going to do about it now.<br/><br/>It seems to me that telling a story about the recipients of this justice is certainly interesting, but it's an entirely different game, and the protagonists are not the Dogs, it's the townsfolk (or whoever). Because if a Dog <i>always</i> feels justified, then the GM is not pushing conflicts hard enough, and not ensuring towns have no easy answers, or the player has no stock in the game and hasn't found anything to attach to. The unwavering justified agent of God is a better NPC, because it's a rather boring PC. (Not that it's boring to play, I think it's neat to play a character who starts that way, but if they've still never questioned any of their actions after 4 or 5 sessions maximum, something isn't right, and it's probably obvious after only 1 or 2 sessions).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349566/#Comment_349566" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T13:01:15+00:00" title="November 23, 2011  1:01PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>But the important thing about Dogs is that every action they do is justified, whether they feel it or not</b><br/>^this.

If the GM makes a town full of zealots ready to immolate themselves for their mistaken beliefs, the Dogs will either be leaving town having backed off their convictions, or the place will be in flames.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350152/#Comment_350152" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T12:24:09+00:00" title="December  1, 2011 12:24PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2011 12:24PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I can't relate the rest of your post to my play experience.

But I'll take the blame for reading quickly and also injecting my own perception of your situation based on the reactions of others in the thread, and my own assumptions on an interesting twist in perspective and theme.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I meant that "How do we decide we're done with this town?" is tied to "How do we feel about the state we'd be leaving it in?"</blockquote>\nAha! Yeah. That's mostly a GM thing, as JD says, but I don't agree that the players don't get to decide it at all.  There's certainly problems to be "solved" that the GM creates in the initial set up. But the player's are the ones who decide what gets solved, and how.  <br/><br/>I've only run it a few times, and never a connected series, but I've found that it's a pretty organic process. The first part of the game is all about the players rooting out the trouble. Then, as they get to endin' sinnin', they'll be ruffling a lot of feathers.<br/><br/>I'd say one major decision point is from the GM. Is there still unsettled business? If the previous conflict didn't automatically raise another, and the players don't have a clear direction for one, is there someone still pissed off or at work with sin, or might a reaction to the Dog's actions provoke someone to sin?<br/><br/>It's rare to leave a town completely content with how things went to pass (which we know is a feature).  There can be cases where the players are leading the GM in this. For example, the GM might think the sin has been handled, but one of the players latched onto a throwaway line from a school marm and needs to make sure that her situation is taken care of.  <br/><br/>In most cases in my experience, I end up (as GM) with the sense that sins have been mostly handled, and there's no case where a townsperson is unhappy enough, or caught up with sin enough, to go against the Dogs anymore (this could be because the Dogs have already made some example executions, but more often it's just that the Dogs tried their best and won conflicts in the right way that no one is up to oppose them anymore), and the players feel like there's not much more they can do. Ultimately, the decision is a group one, with the me highlighting that they might have done all the Good Work they can and it's time to move on, if they seem unsure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
