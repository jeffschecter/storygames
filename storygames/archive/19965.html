She smelled sex and candy, and muttered aloud as she opened the door to her long-empty office: "Hmm. This surely is a dream." <br/><br/>Her twin sister, Candy, was sitting in the chair behind her desk, a nervous look on her face. <br/><br/>The last time Alice had seen Candy had been <span style="color: #808080;">eight years ago</span> when they fished her corpse out of the Hudson river - a corpse which, inexplicably, could not later be found at the morgue. <br/><br/><span style="color: #808080;">There was someone or something stretched out on the floor in front of the desk.</span> The parts of the body seemed mis-matched; limbs were misshapen, wounds gaping, organs missing. The eyes, gaping open and unmoving, were those of a fly--Alice could see her surprised reflection in each of their facets. <br/><br/><span style="color: #808080;">Alice had seen something like this before</span> in a dream she had the night her sister Candy's body was fished out of the river. <span style="color: #808080;">[...]</span> She'd visited a museum of curiosities in the basement of a teaching hospital, a dream that had seemed more real than any dream she'd ever had before. <br/><br/>Candy was pulling her stockings back on as Alice, utterly speechless, took in this phantasmagoric scene. A retinoscope, for conducting eye examinations, inlaid with gold and pearl, rested on the desk.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441463/#Comment_441463" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T06:18:13+00:00" title="January 14, 2015  6:18AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2015 11:02PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>2.</b><br/><br/>"What do you think, Sis?" smiled Candy, clipping her second stocking into place. "Is seeing really believing?"<br/><br/>Finally finding her voice, Alice managed to say, "Hi Sis, I'm so happy to see that you're still alive. Now what in the name of the 9th circle of Hell is going on here?"<br/><br/>"What does it look like?" Candy shrugged. "I knew you didn't use this office much anymore... so I'm <i>taking advantage</i> of it."<br/><br/>Hearing her sister's bossy tone reminded Alice that on that dark day when they found Candy's body, deep inside Alice's secret self she had finally felt free.<br/><br/>Alice responded by crouching into her legs and leaping to the window.<br/><br/>"I wouldn't do that if I were you, Sis, trust me. You open the window and the increased oxygen content will wake him up."<br/><br/>Alice looked out the window and saw that the Mafia car was still waiting in the street outside; the burly goons were leaning on their car, smoking. Alice knew now that she would never get the thing she came for out of the office without Candy noticing. She was fairly sure that the goons, whoever they were, wouldn't get paid unless they delivered her back to the scene of the crime ("unhurt and unmolested", Alice had overheard that line clearly enough, even if she wasn't too certain of any other details).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441864/#Comment_441864" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T06:16:10+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  6:16AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2015 6:07AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>3.</b><br/><br/>Alice moved her gaze back into the office, focusing her eyes on the black statuette that her sister (if that thing really was her sister) was holding.
