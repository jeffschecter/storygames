The last time it came up was <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5729" rel="nofollow">almost exactly a year ago</a> (Feb 2008), which spun off the Owlbear criticism group, which ultimately came to naught.  Remember that?  That was back when I didn't like Graham.  Seems so long ago.  And then <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8778" rel="nofollow">Ralph just brought it up again</a>.<br/><br/>The meme goes like this: <b><i>if we are tougher in our criticism of games, then indie games as a whole will get better.</i></b><br/><br/>While I think the intentions surrounding this meme are commendable (improving games, etc.), I believe the meme is potentially poisonous for a productive social environment.  I'm going to try to explain why.<br/><br/><b>1. The Internet Makes This Tough</b><br/><br/>The indie games community exists in three places, 1) locally, in various communities, 2) at conventions, and 3) on the internet.  While the first two places are great for communicating, the internet, as many people have noticed, is terrible, especially when it comes to talking about highly emotional and touchy topics like the quality of someone else's creative work.  However, when people talking about being tougher in their criticism, they almost universally mean criticizing other people's work by posting things online.<br/><br/><b>2. Criticism is Inherently Caught Up in Status Games</b><br/><br/>Whatever the intent of criticizing someone else's work, it inevitably becomes a status issue if you are criticizing someone you don't know very well.  In retrospect, I used to argue about theory with Ron on the Forge partially because it was a way to feel important, like I was actually contributing, and get attention from folks with a lot more social status than me.  And when high status folks criticize folks with a small amount of status in the community, folks who have just come out with their first game, for example, it creates the sense that the old crowd isn't welcoming the new crowd in.<br/><br/>Other status issues can also manifest.  For example, the fact that the first printing of Shock: was missing certain critical rules never threatened Joshua's status in the community because of his personal relationships with folks.  But if a similar thing happened with a designer who was more on the outside, who lacked personal connections, a harshly critical environment could drive them away. Also, criticism of the work of folks you don't know happens differently than that of folks you do know.  If you don't know someone, you're more likely to publicly post about your problems with their work.  Whereas, if you do know someone well, you can tell them in person or email them or post publicly but in a more personal and direct manner.<br/><br/><b>3. Focusing on Game Texts Before People is Backwards</b><br/><br/>It's much easier to provide constructive criticism when you know someone reasonably well and/or if you're both relatively secure in your status with the community. But it sounds like Ralph doesn't know Greg Saunders from a hole in the ground, yet he implies that Greg's game is unplayable and should never have been carried by IPR. Ouch! Not a good way to begin a friendly, productive, helpful relationship with someone.  Offering harsh, public criticism of a game written by someone you don't really know places your concerns about the game text before your concerns about the person behind it. Otherwise, why not contact a person directly, get to know them first, or approach public criticism more cautiously, because you don't know the author or how to offer criticism in a way that will really be helpful.<br/><br/><b>4. The Community is Only as Strong as Our Relationships</b><br/><br/>On the whole, I'm much more excited about a <b><i>people first, texts second</i></b> approach to offering criticism.  The indie game community is very clearly not like the commercial book publishing community or even mainstream game publishing in that we almost inevitably move from taking interest in each other as fellow players, designer/publishers, and customers to taking interest in each other as people.  This is our greatest strength, I would argue, far more important than having games that are flawlessly crafted.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194253/#Comment_194253" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T20:18:14+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  8:18PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. I agree. The internet is a harsh medium for criticism, which is why I strive to give dedicated criticism in other mediums as well (when asked).<br/><br/>2. Do you think Ralph was playing status games with his post? Was I playing unconscious status games with Chad when he sat me down this weekend? I think you're right to say that if you're playing status games with criticism, you should stop. Criticism is vital, status games are not. I do not think there is inherent status games in criticism.<br/><br/>3. Ralph was criticizing the text and its lack of clear instructions. His post had nothing to do with Greg. What's your point here? It seems like obfuscation.<br/><br/>4. If strong communities are built on people, then strong relationships are built on honesty. Having a community of toothless, smiling congratulators doesn't interest me. Being part of a thriving community of thinking people with differing opinions does.<br/><br/>And to head off an obvious digression: I'm not advocating uncivil behavior or a lack of discretion. <br/><br/>And, if you're going to base your argument on the strength of people, then you must accept that some of your people grumble and curse on the internet.<br/><br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194256/#Comment_194256" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T20:33:03+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  8:33PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2009 8:34PM by shreyas.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So i just read that thread you linked to and I didn't see a single poster fail to make an ass of himself.</p>\n<p>There are venues where review is appropriate. Like, say, the RPGnet Reviews section.</p>\n<p>There are places where critique is appropriate. Like, say, in conversation with the author when he asks you what you think.</p>\n<p>It's often hard to tell when "criticism" means "review, telling some folks what I think so they can make decisions about the product," and when it means "critique, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of a product with the creator in order to better realise his perfect vision." So when we're talking about products, I think we just need to ask ourselves, hey, what environment am I speaking in? Is it an appropriate environment for the kind of discussion I'm starting?</p>\n<p>And when the answer is no, then we need to shut up, or we need to find an appropriate venue. If I'm having a hard time with a game text, I'll turn to my game group first and its (presumed) Internet fanbase second before telling the author, 'ur buk sux'. If I want to know <em>why</em> something works the way it does, I'll probably ask the author. If I'm in a reviewing mood, I'll be careful to separate "stuff I like" from "stuff I don't like but other people might like" and "stuff that probably isn't very good at all." But I don't need to do <em>that</em> among friends, you know?</p>\n<p>We can't be tougher in our criticism by being ruder to each other. That just makes everyone stop listening. We <em>can</em> be tougher in our criticism by seeking out dedicated, discerning feedback, and celebrating the people who give feedback in an honest, clear, and balanced way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194257/#Comment_194257" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T20:37:38+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  8:37PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I too, feel like the OP in the Summerland thread failed to clarify what this is.

Like, obviously the internet sucks for interaction, but I don't think the solution is to say that people can't critique the texts of people they don't know. There's never an excuse for being a jerk, and there's a lot of uncouth behavior in that thread-- but divorcing the example from your general principles, there's nothing inherently wrong with considering the text you purchased before the person you don't know who authored said text. I mean, there's a reason I include my email address with every copy of my game (and send personal emails to people who buy the PDFs)-- so that I can get whatever feedback is neccessary to satisfy the people who shell out money. But if I didn't do that (or even, despite the fact I do that), I'd still be grudgingly okay with people voicing their concerns in a public forum. I worked on this game publicly, with feedback on a forum; I announced my game's availability on a forum; I've posted APs and solicited opinions on a forum. It'd be hypocritical of me to wring my hands and say "But you don't KNOW me!" when people make harsh critique of my game on a forum. If I wanted to shut out the internet from this whole process, I wouldn't have opted into the positive parts in the first place.<br/><br/>I've had some really harsh, dismissive crap broadcasted about my game by someone who was practically a stranger, and it upset me; I mean, I do have feelings. But the person had, in fact, played my game as written and explained by me-- and to me, that's really the only barrier to entry when it comes to talking shit about my work. It forced me to take another look at how to really communicate my game's vision, and I think the text is better for that.<br/><br/>I mean, I have friends. Lots of them are from this community. What I don't have is a flawlessly crafted game. I'd like to think my friends would help me get to that point-- and if people I don't know care about my game enough to get pissed about it and that helps me craft my game better, well, I want to be friends with them too. Does that make sense? I'm not sure how clear I'm being.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194261/#Comment_194261" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T21:02:11+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  9:02PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, focusing on game text before people is not backwards.

Criticism is a form of review that affects what I, as a consumer, will buy. I don't only want to know what the author strived to do, and what he did, I also want to hear what wasn't done well.<br><br>I'm going to quote an idiom, in English it seems to be "Justice must be seen to be done.*" I like the version in Hebrew a bit better, "Justice must not only be done, but be seen."<br>No, this is not about "Justice", but criticism regarding games that are for sale, for money? Public please. Criticism that is of a game not yet released, can be done in private, also so people who look at a game's later version will not be confused by criticism that is no longer valid.<br><br/>The act of selling a game is an ultimate game of making it public. Within the publisher, the game will forever be tied to their soul, from which it was carved (I really like Bialik's (I think) ars poetic description there), but it now also exists on a different plane, the public one, where it will be judged.<br/><br/>* Edit: Or "Not only done, but must be seen to be done." It can be done without being seen, but it doesn't serve its full purpose.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194281/#Comment_194281" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T00:38:19+00:00" title="February 26, 2009 12:38AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2009 12:41AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I don't think it is productive to turn this thread into a forum on whether or not Ralph's OP in another thread was clear enough -- that part of the conversation seems eminently suited to the original thread, where 'what Ralph meant' is entirely on-topic.)<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>On the whole, I'm much more excited about a<b><i>people first, texts second</i></b>approach to offering criticism.</blockquote>\nJonathan, I'm not really sure I understand the people/text distinction at work here. Is this mostly a recapitulation of the previous points (that you should be sensitive to status issues, try to approach them personally, etc.?) or are there other ways you see this 'people first' mentality shaking out <i>in actual criticism</i>?<br/><br/>Based on my background in writing workshops and the like, 'people first' is absolutely the opposite of a good idea -- as a rule, in a workshop scenario (which is semi-public but generally socially closed) you should never talk about the person, and instead limit your critique almost exclusively to <i>the work</i> being critiqued. This is in part to protect against ad hominem confusion and defensiveness, but also because (as several people have pointed out) <i>the work is the thing</i> that you are critiquing.<br/><br/>It is much easier to offer helpful, useful criticism of a specific text than it is to offer helpful, useful criticism of a person -- this is an intentional misreading of 'people first', but there is a point behind it (I think.) Which is that while there is definitely more value in a critique that fully incorporates a personal, engaged knowledge of the individual who produced the work... limiting yourself to giving or receiving that kind of critique is not going to do anyone any favours. Because the other kind of critique -- the impersonal, anonymous, work-specific kind -- is still valuable, and it is <i>fantastically easier to acquire</i>.<br/><br/>I mean it would be great if I could somehow gather enough information about you and your body of work (a particularly excellent example since I think most of it is unreleased!) to make a nuanced critique of Game X that incorporates all this deeper knowledge about your play priorities &amp; where you're coming from &amp; your past work &amp; all that. But given that we have never interacted except on forums that's pretty unlikely, and in fact I would suggest that if I <i>tried</i> to offer that sort of rich/sensitive critique I would probably cause more harm than if I just stuck to 'I don't get what you say on page 8 here' or 'the game fiction was distracting me from the rules' or whatever.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>All of that is kind of jumping the gun a bit, since for all I know you meant something totally different by 'people first' -- but I guess for me it raises the spectre of making everything <i>personal.</i> (At the risk of shooting this thread in the foot I will note briefly that this was why I pitched in my opinion on the other thread, because I felt Ralph's tone had become unintentionally <i>personal</i>.) It seems like you are saying, on the one hand, that the best critique is in fact a personal critique -- but also that there are major obstacles to personal critique on the Internet. I suggest that those obstacles are major whether or not they are on the Internet or elsewhere, and that truly personal critiques should never be part of an established set of community interactions -- they should <i>only</i> result from personal interactions between the two parties that occur outside of the community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194283/#Comment_194283" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T00:47:35+00:00" title="February 26, 2009 12:47AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand that Jonathan and others are trying to work out ways to make criticism work.

They can all write pretty well! So now my book has been properly edited!" No, it hasn't. You've avoided real critique. The text has been read by people who understand what you mean already. <br/><br/>If you want real critique of your text before publication, <i>you need an editor. </i> If you don't get one, and then <i>charge money for your game</i>, you're shooting yourself in the foot. In my book, you deserve everything you get on any forum. You're <i>asking for it</i> by not making sure your text is well-edited before publication.<br/><br/>The real problem, as I see it, is that indie designers want to be treated both as professionals and amateurs; both as real writers and as the purchaser's buddy. <i>No</i>. If you come to my house and cook, you're my buddy. If you're someone I've never met who uploaded their PDFs on lulu and want me to pay for it, you're not my buddy. You're a publisher.

Try posting a thread where you ask for editing help. Preferably, pick someone you don't know personally, from a different gaming culture. (A bit like Frederik did for Montsegur, when he asked Jason to comment on the text, if I'm not mistaken? They've met, but they're still from pretty different traditions.) You'll be in full creative control anyway, so they won't be telling you to change your game; they will, however, ask the sort of stupid questions that are needed for you to improve the clarity of your text.<br/><br/>You could ask me, for example. I've offered my services on Story Games before. I'm editing this year's Knutepunkt book, am co-editing a line of role-playing scenarios, and edited the N\xf8rwegian Style book (which is now dead, sad to say). I've written and published five books, four of which are role-playing books. I've also edited several fanzines. Ideally, in addition to an editor you'll be using a proofreader (to catch grammar and spelling mistakes).<br/><br/>For L\xe6relyst, which is an intro-level game for people with absolutely no gaming experience, we used an editor with no gaming experience (in addition to in-house editing and comments from external playtest). Solid gold. Days of extra work, head-wringing discussions, a lot of explaining of really obvious stuff. If he hadn't caught all my underlying assumptions, our books would have been much harder to use.<br/><br/>So you need to know who you're writing for, and - if possible - choose an editor that suits your target audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194310/#Comment_194310" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T05:12:21+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  5:12AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generally a pissed off customer is not going to give good feedback on a game. I'm not saying Valamir can't complain. I'm saying if it's "what did I spend my $20 on?" then unless the punter gets his $20, the relationship is probably not going to work. Obviously as an author, you don't like to have that kind of thing lying around on the web but it's probably wisest to employ a very light touch or even ignore. It's to the author's credit that he didn't.<br/><br/>The problem here is that "where's my $20?" sounds a lot like "you bastard, you took my $20", it's pratically ad hominem, especially without the benefit of a wry smile or the proferred pint of beer. And so I don't agree with the person then text. I'm not judging anyone by their game. I can't read Mountain Witch but that doesn't make the author a bad person. It doesn't even make it a bad game. Which wasn't quite what you're saying, but it does mean the language, or the passion of the criticism needs to be more precisely targeted. I'm not sure of the value of passion in criticism anyway. Unless you write very well, any negative passion is going to be taken as a personal attack and positive passion can often be taken as fanboyism. That said, what are You doing for Vincent Baker Day?<br/><br/>I also don't agree with the just the text critiques. Unless you've played the bloody thing, then all you can really offer is a comment on readability and prettiness. These are important factors in a product but not so much in the experience delivered by the game. Unless you've had the experience, it's pretty much just supposition. OK, I exaggerate somewhat you can tell from text to a certain extent what the play is going to be like, especially as an experienced gamer but you do get surprises like in Mortal Coil when you realise how important the passions are for play. They build a strong bridge between narration, character and mechanics.<br/><br/>Most of what passes for criticism on RPGnet, even from those who write well, is either hurrah! or boo!, this is my kind of game so its good, otherwise it sucks. It's not useful and even damaging if your first review is written by someone who isn't your kind of gamer. I still don't like 4e but it seems to me it does what it says on the packet. So, really, there's little point in criticising something which you think has no merit or is never going to push your buttons. You wasted your $20.

It's about my worries about some trends I seen in the indie game community. If you feel like you can't participate in the discussion, because of the way it started, I apologize.  I do think that, when you buy indie games, you're effectively buying a relationship with the designer. You're buying into (if you want) emailing them with questions or talking with them on forums or playing games with them at conventions. You're buying into asking them questions about the game you yourself are designing and the expectation that they'll be willing to help you out.  That's what makes the indie games community awesome (one of the key things, at least).<br/><br/><b>Luke:</b> I don't think Ralph was playing status games but I do worry that he unintentionally made things harder for Greg instead of better. You're right, sometimes people do get ornery on the internet.  I'm just trying to resist a meme that says, basically, "People should get ornery on the internet more often."  I think there are much better ways of actually improving games, if that's what our ultimate goal is.<br/><br/><b>Shreyas:</b> You're getting closer to the points I was hoping we could talk about, which is to say, how can we actually make games better by creating a social environment that's supportive of game designers, rather than simply critical of them in potentially non-helpful ways?  I think the recent rise in the number of game projects that have editors working on them is a good sign, but you're right that finding those connections and building a constructive relationship with an editor sometimes takes a fair amount of work. Also, I don't think there's the general expectation yet that, when following the autuer model of solo-producing a game, that having good editing is critical.  Many folks, I think, still plan on doing everything themselves.  And part of me thinks that's okay too, because there should be a variety of publication models and not all of them should require editing (frex: XXXtream Street Luge, ashcans, roleplaying poems, Ghost/Echo), since not all of them are 100+ page books.<br/><br/><b>Elizabeth:</b> I agree (I think) with your suggestion that, because we operate in public, we should be able to handle complaints in public too.  I think when customers that we have no relationship with post critical things, yes, we should be able to deal with that.  I guess I'm more concerned about the dynamics between designer/publishers and feel that... hmm... we owe something different to other folks who are struggling with producing games, because we've been in their shoes, and should be able to find a way to be more productive in our communication and criticism when it comes to them.  I realize that's a bit idealistic and, as Luke says, sometimes people get ugly on the internet, but I think it's worth trying to aim for something better.<br/><br/><b>Daniel:</b> Hopefully I've clarified what I mean by "people first" in some of these other responses.  I'm basically saying: don't let our desire to make games better harm the supportive relationships between designer/publishers that are our ultimate source of strength.  By all means, do whatever you need to do to make the critique and editing process work, but have that be based on a productive and helpful relationship between people, even if its strictly a professional relationship between an author and an editor.  I don't mean you have to be friends with someone in order to critique their work.  That's going a bit overboard.  My intention is more like... being an indie designer/publisher is like being part of a trade guild in medieval times, where fellow craftsmen were obligated to help each other out.

I do think that, when you buy indie games, you're effectively buying a relationship with the designer. You're buying into (if you want) emailing them with questions or talking with them on forums or playing games with them at conventions. You're buying into asking them questions about the game you yourself are designing and the expectation that they'll be willing to help you out.  That's what makes the indie games community awesome (one of the key things, at least).<br/><br/></blockquote>\nAgain, speaking as a story-games noob this is beyond me. Over my head and out the window. If a product is sold to me explicitly stating what you wrote, fine, i can make an informed descision and decide whether i want to BUY myself into this community. Alas, it is not so. Indie games are NOT sold with a warning stating:   this game supposes familiarity with story games of indie tradition. game experience might chance for those with no experience with these kind of games. <br/><br/>No instead these games are sold like any other product.

Granted, I haven't done a lot of criticism of game texts, but I've done plenty of both creative writing and essays, and I think it's much much easier to provide useful and constructive feedback in an nearly anonymous context or when you know someone VERY well.  But just reasonably well?  Then I have to be worrying about whether I'm going to hurt the person's feelings and whether my feedback will be disregarded because they've decided they don't like me.  It's a mess, especially because, if you're critiquing my work, I don't WANT you to spare my feelings.  I want you to tell me everything you hate, everything that you think doesn't work.  If you happen to point out some things that you think work well, awesome, but what I really want to know is everything that fails.  You don't need to be a jerk about it, of course.  And, of course, I might choose to ignore you.  But if multiple people tell me the same thing is a problem, then I'm going to seriously reexamine my approach to that thing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>There are places where critique is appropriate.

Because if so, I completely disagree.  If a person offers a work up for public consumption, they must be prepared for public criticism.  Again, I think anyone offering a critique of a work would do well to not be a dick about it.  After all, there's no reason to go out of your way to be rude.  But the idea that if I have criticism to offer I should hold my tongue because I don't know the author personally and he or she hasn't actually ASKED for my opinion seems absurd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194335/#Comment_194335" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T07:04:52+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  7:04AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Am I a consumer who has the right to criticize a product I purchased and find lacking?<br/>Or am I a friend who's supposed to have the best interests of my friend in mind?</blockquote>I don't think it matters.

That's exactly the point I was trying to make about not charging money for your game if its one that requires a shared understanding to play.  Once you make it available to people who don't have your shared understanding and you charge money for it you have an OBLIGATION as a producer of product to make your product useable to those people.  And if you don't, you don't get to hide behind notions of "can't we all be friends".  Yes.  Friends are good.  But that's an entirely seperate issue from being the producer of a product.<br/><br/>This distinction is important, and its why, Jonathan, I don't think, that you're the right host of a discussion on this topic.  You've elected to give your games away for free in whatever state of completion they happen to be in at the time.  A decision I respect, admire, and support.  But it does mean that you have taken yourself out of the Ven circle that includes producers of product for which money is charged.  Your needs and desires and ideal model for social criticism...quite frankly really don't apply IMO to the world where money changes hands.  In fact, I find your points above alien and largely unapplicable to the post production world where money has already changed hands.  All of your points are great while the game is still a product being produced.  But once its out the door with a price tag on it.  No.  Those points are not useful anymore.  <br/><br/>Once money changes hands, yes, my concerns about the product very much come before my concerns about the person.  Once the person takes money from me they are a supplier, a vendor, a producer.  Our personal relationship is over here...our transactional relationship is over there.  Frankly if an individual cannot seperate those two and know which hat they're wearing at any given time, and be able to tell the difference between "your product sucks" and "I hate you as a person" then they've no business being a producer of a for sale product.   <br/><br/>And Shreyas.  Yes.  Those questions are EXACTLY what you should be asking your editor about.  Not "hey Editor can you answer these questions for me".  But "Hey Editor can you uncover questions about my text that I failed to answer effectively".   "Hey Editor who is not a gamer, can you understand the process and the steps involved in playing this game just from reading this book, and if not, where do I lose you."  If you aren't asking your editor that, then you don''t have an editor, you have a proof reader.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194346/#Comment_194346" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T07:20:49+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  7:20AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Yeah but we're pretty clearly having a disagreement here on how that criticism should be carried out, not on whether criticism is helpful or not.

I don't participate in this community to sell games or make money, so constructing my relationships with other people based on those things just isn't the way I operate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194371/#Comment_194371" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T08:12:42+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  8:12AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2009 8:12AM by khelek.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every consumer interacts differently with their products.

I know that i read post differently based on author. <br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly don't think it serves anyone to censor feed back, even if we personally disagree with the format. We will all just have to send Ralph some warm feelings and hope that his next criticism has nicer in tone. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy next goal is to read Summerland without undue influence by other posts. It was purchased this weekend and is now sitting on my shelf.

We have social protocols for how to deal with people we buy things from and different ones for how to deal with our friends. When those people are our friends things get a little hairy. I will deal with problems I have with the text of How to Host a Dungeon differently with Tony who I don't know from Adam than I will with the text of Dictionary of Mu whose author I live with.<br/><br/>When places like IPR distribute to retailers and you have a 14 year old who's never heard of Story Games picking up a Mouseguard, it doesn't matter if you call them writers and players, the relationship between her and Luke is quite impersonal.<br/><br/>Maybe this is far afield of what Jonathan is talking about, but I think the indie games community and the population of people who could feasibly end up critiquing an indie game extends beyond Story Games's walls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194430/#Comment_194430" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T10:27:44+00:00" title="February 26, 2009 10:27AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I don't know that people who have published a game have a <i>duty</i> to be kinder and more gentle than the average consumer. I mean, when Ryan Dancey buys my game, he has as much right to be grumpy if it's not good as someone who's never considered game design-- heck, he probably has <i>more</i> right, because he knows what a good, professional game looks like.<br/><br/>I just cringe at the idea of mixing business and friendship too much. It hasn't worked well for the community in the past, I think.

Because... I totally disagree.  I don't see it as telling creators how to behave any more than I'm telling movie-makers how to behave when I describe what I thought worked well or poorly about a particular movie.    Similarly, I always try my best NOT to speak as though my opinion were anything more than an opinion.  But just because it's <i>only</i> an opinion doesn't mean it can't contain valuable information.<br/><br/>So... yeah.  I don't see anything inherently "uncool" in saying: "I think this game does Thing A really well and Thing B really poorly and I'd like to see more games that do stuff like Thing A and less like Thing B."<br/>I have no intention of holding myself back from saying something like that if I read something that really rubs me the right or wrong way.  Everyone is more than welcome to ignore it because it is, as you say, only an opinion, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't be allowed to share it.  If/when I eventually produce some kind of game-thing, I certainly hope everyone will tell me what they think works or doesn't work about it, and if they want to do that in a public forum, that's fine with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194454/#Comment_194454" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T11:10:28+00:00" title="February 26, 2009 11:10AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>If your object, with your discussion of my product, is to better inform other consumers, then<strong>do it in public, but don't address me.</strong>I have already decided my product is worth buying.

They make such a fuss, usually over a small matter and do no favours to anyone involved.

I mean, this is even in story-games' mission statement thingy that Andy wrote.  Confusing "Story Games" for "the Internet" is just silly.  The Internet is a valuable tool for communication.  That this forum is crap for communicating criticism does not by any means equate to the internet being crap for communicating criticism.  <strong><em>Story Games is not a creative community</em></strong>, and expecting it to act as such is asking for disappointment.<br/><br/>Second, the vast majority of first-time game designers and publishers are not ready to take any sort of criticism in anything like a constructive fashion.  Having been one of the big supporters of "more criticism" last year, this is the conclusion that I came to: the community that I sought to help is largely incapable of being helped \u2014 and doesn't want to be helped.  Most folks just want to see their game in print and look nice, and that's fine.  It's now my policy to let designers get that out of their system before actually offering criticism.  This usually means I only offer criticism to (a) people who are working on game number two or three, and/or (b) people I know and interact with face-to-face.  Basically, I make sure that the person is actually serious about quality and not seeking microfame recognition or a sense of accomplishment.  Otherwise it's not worth my time or theirs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194478/#Comment_194478" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T11:56:45+00:00" title="February 26, 2009 11:56AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Hardly, in indie gaming, surely?

And to those that I find that are, I offer criticism.  Determining that a designer is committed to quality, though, really requires talking with them <em>a lot</em>, and mostly only happens with folks I talk to regularly and face-to-face.  This has nothing to do with internet-mediated communication sucking and works purely on frequency \u2014 I talk to those people more often, therefore I am more certain of their commitment to quality.<br/><br/>There is also a big difference in my mind, and probably a difference I should have pointed out, but whatever, between offering criticism and offering advice.  I am totally all over offering first-timers advice on how to get their games out there.  So I'm not saying, "Fuck the newbies!"  I'm very interested in helping.  There are just different kinds of help that are appropriate for different people at different points in their publishing careers and with whom I have different relationships.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194496/#Comment_194496" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T12:24:34+00:00" title="February 26, 2009 12:24PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My girlfriend and I were talking the other day about how our second dog is going to be named Shenanigans.<br/><br/>Just wait until I call Shenanigans on you, Judd.

But I hate giving private criticism. The only creator who benefits from private criticism is the one receiving it, and then, my experience is that half the time it doesn't get processed as well as public criticism would have. And with public feedback, other creators benefit by following the synthetic thinking and participating in the conversation.<br/><br/>So these days I pretty much only give public feedback. And this is the way to do it. You simply have to communicate as part of your feedback that you understand what the game designer is trying to achieve, and that you love that same vision and that you can see and you love the parts of the game that are contributing to it. Then, doesn't matter whether you've never previously spoken a word to the designer, you can give ruthless and exhaustive constructive criticism, publicly. They already know you love their game.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194527/#Comment_194527" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T13:40:44+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  1:40PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Brian, I don't understand what you mean in the context of this thread.

Luke and his fanboys promptly swooped in.  Rather than calm these fans down or stay out of the fray, Luke decided to stick around and put the boot in yourself thereby establishing that he has no interest in being a "part of a thriving community of thinking people with differing opinions".  In fact, his behaviour could easily serve as a demonstration of why a culture of robust online RPG criticism is absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>I don't have a wider opinion on Luke and have no interest in his games, but I do think that for the purposes of pursuing the dream of a "thriving community of thinking people with differing opinions" it is necessary to defend it and to draw attention to people who profess to support that dream whilst displaying through their actions very different sympathies indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194547/#Comment_194547" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T14:07:13+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  2:07PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, that is a great example.<br/><br/>Because that was not criticism.

What I wanted to do was use what was published as a conversation piece about what works and doesn't <em>not for the person who published it but for the next generation of things to be more awesome and to make new "mistakes" instead of old.</em>  That very intent was the cause of a day's argument as people said that that was bullshit.<br/><br/>* And then I got caught up in internet bullshit that made my initially leave this forum, almost quit my podcast, and overall make me decide to hermit the fuck up and only talk with people whom I could trust and had a rapport with enough to get past any internet bullshit.<br/><br/>* But no, I got all the fuck caught up in "a cause" of "trying to make something better" when I posted my criticisms on the Ashcan Front shortly before GenCon.  That ruined my vacation in Vegas, because my phone kept beeping with hate mail.  A good part of that was my wording and my lack of tone &amp; inflection, but as much of it is the fact that other people are going to read your text not for your good points but to attack you as a way of defending this thing that perceive (correctly or no) as attacking.  And once you get to that mode with some people, they never let up, regardless of how much you try to dial back, personally apologize over IM, etc.  Once you cross that line, you fuck yourself for a long time.<br/><br/>* One of the lessons I learned in that one, by the way, was to not fucking use hyperbole on the internet.  I tried it as a way to diffuse something serious, as those who know me know I swear &amp; say shit as a joke.  But it's not taken that way on the internet, so saying (not looking it up to verify the exact wording) that "the Ashcan Front was a blight on the community" was, definitely, a BAD THING to say.  And I didn't mean it.  I mean, who the fuck actually means shit like that?!?<br/><br/>Oh, right, it's the fucking Internet.<br/><br/>* I started writing up some serious criticism, of the "scholarly, let's explore and learn from this thing" kind for In a Wicked Age..., but that just fatigued me.  And, in the end, I felt like it was going to start more arguments than it was going to help anyone out.  I would rather talk with Vincent about this now, even though it wouldn't "help the next generation," because it has become clear that the cost-benefit ratio is...well, there's a shitton of cost and low-if-any benefit for me, and personally talking with Vincent would at least make that ratio less out of favor, because it would be me getting to learn some shit and maybe having a good conversation in person.<br/><br/>* I have also chosen to never, ever speak of things that I think shouldn't be engaged.  I don't want to give free press to anything I consider pure shit.  So, when I say anything about ashcans or IAWA, it's because there's at least a kernel of awesome there I recognize, and only want to help make things based on that better.  That said, no one will accept that truth when they're reading you with hostile intent, and pointing that out in the middle of a flame war you're caught it does exactly no good.<br/><br/>So, would we be a healthier community if we could engage in honest, public criticism of published works for current and future creators?  Hell yes we would, but only because the only way we could be is if the internet was a more civil, in-person, nicer place...and that alone would make this a healthier community.  I feel a bit like Ben Lehman last year, who shat on those of use who wanted to do this very thing because "we've brought it up before to no avail."  But there's a reason this idea never gets traction -- you're fighting against a stream of internet hate to criticize things and there's little self-benefit.  You have to want to be an asshole who is okay with being hated, and if that's the case then even those who might otherwise "follow" you want to distance themselves as the message is trashed by the messenger.  Then you end up with a pile of shit and seen as (if I recall the phrase used to describe me correctly) "relentlessly negative and only worshiping innovation."<br/><br/>Fuck, that's bileous.  Let me restate this more positively, but leave that intact for those who want to ask "Wait, Mack, tell us how you really feel?"<br/><br/>I have seen first- and second-hand that communities like this reject criticism, even when individuals don't.  To focus on the community is, then, unfortunately the harder and more likely to fail choice.  But individuals can be spoken to on a more personal level, can engage more directly in dialog, don't generally suffer from "internet time" the way a cacophonous forum thread can be, etc.  Communities do not want this, even when they might be healthier for it (and that is of no guarantee when the critic is reviled).  Individuals, however, can benefit.  But, since individuals are what make up a community, this isn't a lost cause -- help enough out, and you'll make a dent.  You can't "fix" a community overnight (or maybe ever), but you can help make one or two people happier with their craft.<br/><br/>And that's awesome.  I wish whoever does that luck in achieving it.  For my money, I actually enjoy this community of indie awesome when I'm making a fun podcast and running a forum about how gaming isn't the same thing to everyone -- and trying to be a "champion of an ideal" nearly broke me last year.<br/><br/>(Feel free to criticize the shit out of this.  And me.  It's not like I can stop you.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194563/#Comment_194563" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T14:20:56+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  2:20PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>But Paul's advice seems, to me, significantly different.

I am weak. I come down to earth and talk to people about ideas. I challenge people to defend what they say. And this is why you and I are at odds here. I want honest discourse, even if it means that we're rude to one another occassionally. You, you are jealous that I have fanboys.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm upset because I'm a critic.  Not of games but of other things.  I've seen websites brought down by irate authors and their fans, I've seen fans stalk critics and I've seen critics give up and never write another review because of the hordes of shut-ins who took it upon themselves to avenge the honour of their favourite authors.  The reason why this happens is because authors have power and critics have none.  Critics are the guys who take time out of their day to offer up an opinion about something because they think someone else might find it helpful.  Most of them aren't paid and nobody ever steps up to defend them.  There is no way a critic can win an argument against an author and his fans, the best he can hope for is to crawl up in a ball and hope that other people think the author is a dick for kicking him. Because of that, any author who tries to shut up a reviewer is a bully.<br/><br/>In the case of Kurt, the guy is a terrible reviewer.  His tastes are dire, his analytical skills are not what they should be and his review of Burning Empires was, as you correctly point out, not a review.  However, he took time out of his day to read your game, write down some opinions, get himself filmed and produce a video and then put it all online because he thought someone might benefit from it.  He was doing something for the wider gaming community and that, in my book, makes him one of the good guys.<br/><br/>You don't get to mistreat the good guys and then pretend to be one of them, that's why I said what I said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194586/#Comment_194586" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T14:41:29+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  2:41PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>communities like this</blockquote>What do you mean by this?

Thanks, Ryan.  You didn't answer my last question, though, which was the one I was most interested in.  Are there communities (and I suppose I'm speaking primarily about RPG communities) that are more open to criticism?

I'm not sure I agree.  I think it's harder on the internet, but I think it can be done.  Of course, I'm of the opinion that you don't need to get to know someone personally before critiquing their work.  I know there are many internet-based groups set up specifically for the purpose of sharing and critiquing fiction.  I don't belong to any of them (though possibly I should...) but I doubt they try to get to know everyone personally first.  I think it's entirely possible a similar thing could be done for game designers and critics, though it would probably work best if it were a private forum created specifically for that purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194644/#Comment_194644" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T15:45:28+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  3:45PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite><br/>Just as I don't want this thread to be about how much you're not a dick.</blockquote>\n:-) point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_194649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194649/#Comment_194649" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T15:50:25+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  3:50PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2009 3:52PM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>The meme goes like this:<b><i>if we are tougher in our criticism of games, then indie games as a whole will get better.</i></b></blockquote>\nI believe that by widening our scope of possible criticism/responses, we will learn a lot more about what a single game need at just the time it is presented to us.

Or are they friends, colleagues and fellow travelers?) seems misplaced to me. It's something that is a concern ONLY to a limited number of people, but the question pre-supposes that it applies to everyone.<br/><br/>For example, I read threads at Story Games, because people here sometimes talk about games I like, in a manner I like. And I like the fact that buying/playing small-press, independent games means I can interact directly with the creator. <br/><br/>But I (like many gamers) don't identify myself as a member of any particular community, so the question that seems so galvanizing doesn't even really apply. If I pick up a game I heard neat things about, and play it, and don't like it, I might post an AP, or contribute a comment to a thread somewhere, and say "I didn't like this game" or "This game was nowhere near as fun for me as Poster X says" or even "I really hated this game / didn't get it".<br/><br/>I have every right to do that, without giving any thought to the game designer as a person. Because I don't have a relationship with him or her. I just played the game they wrote. A relationship was not cited as a prerequesite for play. In fact, just the opposite was implied (in almost all cases).<br/><br/>When I pick up a game by a designer who *is* a member of a given community, I don't automatically subscribe to that community and its standards and expectations and shared history. I may not even know about it. <br/><br/>Unless you're explicitly making games for friends or members of a certain group, you don't have any real power over what form discussion of that game takes. You should be able to expect basic courtesy, even on the internets, but that's the extent of it.<br/><br/>PS - To me, this applies whether I paid for the game or not. These are creative efforts, forms of art .. not mass-produced goods.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194665/#Comment_194665" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T16:30:23+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  4:30PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some replies, to stuff!\n<blockquote>I love reading games in development and thinking about and having conversations about them.

The only creator who benefits from private criticism is the one receiving it, and then, my experience is that half the time it doesn't get processed as well as public criticism would have. And with public feedback, other creators benefit by following the synthetic thinking and participating in the conversation.</blockquote>\nThat's Paul Czege. So, here's another thing, if someone releases a game with holes, and he never got pointed at the holes, and he can show us he engaged in massive and multi-layered playtesting and editing, we'll sigh, but we'll move on. If someone receives a note that something is problematic but continues to disregard it... that's also how we look at some government issues: If you call them out when they can change things, and they don't change them, it's important to be able to call them out on this, and point at said public constructive criticism.<br/>Sure, "Shaming" should not be done when possible, but some people fully deserve to wear the Hubcup of Shame.<br/><br/>Judd totally stole my thunder with the cop-out comment.

He had played in a game of Ganakagok that I ran a little bit earlier, and I ran into him at the hotel bar.<br/><br/>"What did you think of that game of Ganakagok?" he said.<br/><br/>This was the second time I'd run the game that weekend, and I felt pretty good about it. It was a small, personal story mainly about people confronting their own limitations and the recalcitrance of others. I was proud of myself, mainly for two moments: (1) Challenging Dave Cleaver's pessimistic hermit to paddle out as far as the horizon to see the dawn and thereby regain his hope (in the fiction) -- and convincing Dave that he wanted to take that challenge, even though at first he thought it was crazy (at the table). (2) Pleading with Andrew's character as the collective spirits of the Ancestors not to be sent into oblivion by his efforts to rid the people of their old ways.<br/><br/>"Best game ever," I said, expansively, fully expecting him to agree. "How'd you like it?"<br/><br/>"Mmm...not so much," he said. "It was my least favorite of all the games of Ganakagok I've played."<br/><br/>This of course took me aback, and so we talked about why he had that response. It turned out that Andrew wasn't taken with exactly the prosaic but intimate quality that I thought was a strength in that game: it didn't feel mythic to him in the same way as other sessions of the game had felt. <br/><br/>"Yeah, I get that," I told him. "It's not like the time you became the sun and had to spend the rest of eternity screaming in pain as you burned in the sky."<br/><br/>"So what I learned," Andrew said a little later, "is that if I want that mythic quality, I have to push harder against what other players want."<br/><br/>Notice that in our discussion of the game we'd played, we both were able to reflect upon what had happened, and why, and how responsibility for the outcome of play could be apportioned between the system and the people at the table. In short: we talked about the game, and we learned something about it. <i>That was criticism.</i> It emerged from our roles as players in the game, not from identifying ourselves as "critic" and "criticized" in some sort of formal way.<br/><br/>I offer that in order to expand upon what I meant by "case-by-case basis."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194703/#Comment_194703" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T20:39:19+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  8:39PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2009 8:40PM by fnord3125.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>I offer that in order to expand upon what I meant by "case-by-case basis."</blockquote>That is a GREAT story.<br/>But here's my question:<br/>This was criticism of a <i>particular instance</i> of the game.

I believe you are to singularly focused on the individual, Bill. You have to give more serious thought to the social/environmental part of this.<br/><br/>No man is an island. We communicate in an environment, and forming the environment is done in the meta-communication. In regards to criticism we need to talk about what kind of criticism we need and want, and how we will receive it. By creating a consensus that several forms of criticism is constructive to our chances for better games, we may awaken an attitude amongst us which in turn will decide much off how we take criticism.<br/><br/>The attitude may enable us to take criticism in a constructive manner. By supporting this attitude in each other, we may create the necessary basis for a more effective communication on design. There is no other way to do this, than to uphold such an attitude in debates like this.<br/><br/>By suppressing the meta-communication, or undermining it, we will surely fail in building a constructive environment for criticism, or any other constructive dialogue. So please give your best in these debates too, as they build the social environment for our game-dialogue.<br/><br/>A flexible and dynamic environment driven by acceptance is indeed possible on the net. This forum is close enough, so we may as well make it happen here too. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194730/#Comment_194730" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-27T04:21:31+00:00" title="February 27, 2009  4:21AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>It seems to me as though criticism of a game<i>as a text</i>is different [from criticism of an instance of play] and can be approached in in a somewhat more "formal" way and still be useful.<br/>What do you think?</blockquote>\nI'm willing to be convinced that they are different, but I don't know that I'd accept the difference as granted (that is, I'd argue that there is really very little difference, and see which of us convinces the other first). I'm not sure the outcome of that argument would affect things much, though, since we'd still have to get through what makes criticism "useful" or "constructive."<br/><br/>So what do you mean by "formal," exactly? I think you mean operating under precisely the sort of rules of engagement that this thread is trying to hash out. My position is <i>not</i> that there are no rules at all, but rather that a more-or-less consensual "culture of critique" will emerge (and continue to emerge, evolvingly) from our individual efforts to communicate with each other about our games. That's already happened, and its character can be divined from how "the story-games community" is painted as alternatively supportive or self-congratulatory, egalitarian or rife with invidious status distinctions (people see it differently, in other words). To the extent that we're unhappy with the culture of critique as it stands, the solution seems to me to be to engage in the sort of critique you'd like to see and hope that it will serve as a model and exemplar for others.<br/><br/>If you are saying that we should establish a set of formal conventions, Magna Carta-like, to govern the informal but very powerful ones that already guide our interactions, I'm not sure that effort will be fruitful. But if you're saying that we should as individuals be self-conscious about what we're up to when we engage in what we consider "criticism of game-texts" and attempt to abide by an ethics of communication, then I'd absolutely agree.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Bill, I think the reason this devolves into shit-storms, and that I take your "Do what you want, take full responsibility for it" is that attempts to codify are attempting to bind, someone. Either A can only criticize in way X and no other, or B must receive criticism in this manner.</blockquote>\nLet me just say that I'm sensitive to the argument that my position as stated ignores the social dynamics of criticism in which saying something that can be construed as negative opens one up to vituperative personal attacks from others who take offense at the fact of your criticism rather than engaging with its substance. And so I don't believe and am not arguing that the "invisible hand" of the marketplace of ideas will produce the best possible discursive outcome; occasionally it is necessary to engage in the sort of communal self-reflection that's taking place here. My point is that you shouldn't expect that self-reflection to produce a set of binding and all-encompassing rules or procedures; the most that it can do -- and hopefully it will be enough -- is sensitize those who participate to the variety of perspectives and range of viewpoints that exist, and make them more self-conscious about their own communicative efforts. Metacommunication is good precisely because it makes us aware of how what we say is interpreted by others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194732/#Comment_194732" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-27T04:34:53+00:00" title="February 27, 2009  4:34AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we're in agreement Bill.

But I hate giving private criticism. The only creator who benefits from private criticism is the one receiving it, and then, my experience is that half the time it doesn't get processed as well as public criticism would have. And with public feedback, other creators benefit by following the synthetic thinking and participating in the conversation.</blockquote>\nWhilst you might hate giving it, it is an exceptionally useful and, I think, undervalued method of getting feedback. Many novelists have a small group of preferred readers who will give them feedback, untainted by an audience or the other readers. This ties in to what I was talking about, the difference between public and quarantined playtests.<br/><br/>A negative critique by a well known game designer of a half-finished game can sit at the top of the google search like rotting roadkill long after that game is published. <br/><br/>But public discussion by peers is helpful, too. In our writing group, we say what we like about something before we say what we don't like, and only give constructive negative feedback. If a particular genre is not to our taste, we make that clear, too. Finally, everyone gets to have their say without the writer saying defensive things in response to the others, before asking more questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_194741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194741/#Comment_194741" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-27T06:42:10+00:00" title="February 27, 2009  6:42AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>And while my original formulation may seem to privilege the individual in a way that seems too strong, I want to argue that focusing on individual agency is a necessary rhetorical move toward developing a communal "ethics of critique" in which people take ownership of their communication behavior.

Our group uses the Clarion rules, which can be pretty simply summed up as (1) critique the manuscript, and only the manuscript, that's on the table; (2) no personal commentary about the author, though pointing to apparent skill level or intent as manifested in the manuscript is OK; (3) nothing ad hominem or insulting ("This story blows goat cheese!"); (4) substantive, constructive comments should be the focus of oral critiques, not nitpicking over punctuation errors.  In practice, most folks at the table try to point to some aspects of the story they like before dealing with what doesn't work.  Typically, we try to explain why something isn't working, and suggest some possible solutions.  We also pose questions to check our understanding of the author's intent.<br/><br/>This isn't Pollyanna-ish feel-goodism for the sake of happy puppies, hugz, and starbrite flower sprinkles.  I've seen some stories that had *nothing* good to recommend them other than that they came to a merciful end before I started to spurt blood from the eyeballs.  But you still try to find <i>something</i> good to say: "great effort," "congratulations on submitting such an...ambitious manuscript," "I'm a big fan of this genre," "I liked the scene where your character was strained through the chainlink fence," etc.  That's basic respect, IMO; baseline validation and support for the act of putting your work into a public forum.<br/><br/>Critique is not a one-way process.  There is a grace and philosophy to how you receive a critique.  You can ask questions, follow up on particular comments, check to see if the critic understood your text properly.   Anytime you invest yourself in a creative work, there will be some parts about which you'll feel especially and inevitably defensive.  Some critiques will trigger the hell out of you, sometimes because they come from so-and-so, the mouth-breather at the end of the table who spends his crit minute droning about the minutiae of black powder weapon ignition and how you fucked the pooch with it in your story.  If you submit something with a thick ego-wrapping, and you can't take a deep breath and let it flow over you, your creative career is probably destined to be nasty, brutish, and short.  Have your feelings, but don't expect everyone else to be the caretaker of them.<br/><br/>If you put your story into the stream of commerce, I think you're opening yourself completely to criticism.  I bought Dogs in the Vineyard.  Do I know Vincent?  Not personally.  It seems a bit absurd to assume that my critique of his game is or should therefore be  less valid.  Ignore the rants, but accept that you'll get a few from the wilds.  Deep breath.  Move on.<br/><br/>If you put your playtest version up for feedback, you're asking for feedback on the manuscript, not speculation about your personal life, etc.  If constructive criticism is offered with respect and a decent focus on the manuscript and the critiquer's reaction to it, I think the recipient should suck it up, regardless of whether defensive feelings come up.  Some people will be more thin- or thick-skinned than others.  That's not something we as critics or potential-consumers-with-feedback have control over.   I assume that if someone puts something up here for critique, they're admitting their baby is a work in progress and acknowledging (tacitly) that people are going to poke some holes in it.<br/><br/>Everyone wants validation, but beyond the basic boundaries of respect, validation has to be earned.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0033FF;"><i>Edited to add:  Part of the value of public criticism is hearing how other critics are reacting and then responding to that as well.

Because in the past, I've spoken of critiques and being a critic.  Here is what I learn in art school.<br/><br/>A constructive critique is a gift.  My taking time out of my schedule and life and looking at a 16 year old's drawing of wolverine... I'm giving her experience, a trained eye and a particular stylistic point of view.  If the 16 year old is smart, she will listen.  EVEN if she feels I'm flat out wrong.  Because she can react to what is both wrong or right and hopefully continue to develop her abilities to draw the next wolverine picture.  I have an local artist friend who is older and in a lot of ways downright better painter than I.  But I do not hesitate in giving my particular take on his art.  My own mom has recieved and given my critiques, as she too is an artist with a very different eye.  Two sets of eyes on the project is always better than one.  Even if they have to defend themselves a bit on why my advice is wrong... I've gotten them to think for a moment outside of their own skulls.  <br/><br/> If both the deliverer and the bestowed can view the critique as a gift.... then so much of the hurt is gone.  It just vanishes.  As soon as I realized that in art school, I didn't avoid or cringe from critique, the exact opposite, I hungered for it.  I wanted it, that give and take on how to make the art better.  Shit.  I live for conversations like that.  <br/><br/>But giving a critique is a responsibility.  I look forward to helping out my fellow artists.  I want them to be better.  I love seeing the light go on and them to  often go in a direction that I didn't even expect.  The critique is a springboard to better stuff, better than anything I was saying.  And saying what you do like about it or what is working is a great way to soften the blow.  I tend to reserve that for last, so I don't leave someone with the last discussion point on the piece as negative.  I think that is just good etiquette.  <br/><br/>And I think game design is an artform.  So I think my model of how to conduct a critique is a pretty damn good rule of thumb.  But I agree with Bill, all of these things are case by case.  Some folks want to be ripped a new one.  Other folks need a bit of hand holding.  Coming up with a one size fits all for INDEPENDENT gaming seems a tough stretch.  However, to discuss rules of thumb?  Not a bad idea at all.<br/><br/>As for the internets...  I think it can serve a purpose.  Go to Ten Ton Studios and look at reviews of the weekly sketch challenge.  They are respectful and helpful at the same time.  I used to run Storn's Bootcamp for Artists and assign faux and sometimes real assignments to anyone who wanted to submit artwork and then critique the art.  It was HUGELY successful.  So successful, I stopped doing it because writing out 3 or 4 paragraphs for some 20+ artists was taking away from time to do art too much.

So you either have to avoid the issue by making sure all criticism is either anonymous or private, or embrace the issue by making sure giving and accepting well thought out criticism is an action that generates status itself, like on The Forge.<br/><br/>A designer who did not seek out criticism will rarely assimilate it when given, especially if the creation of their game was driven by status in the first place. The best you can hope for is that other designers are paying attention, but even that is rarer than the folks who just like to see a good flame war or who are able to see the same problems in their own game designs.<br/><br/>And while public criticism <i>may</i> benefit more than the designer receiving it, such should be done after the game has been released commercially, because a controversial critique can remain at the top of the search charts long after it becomes obsolete. And in those rare times I critique a friend's work with the intent to help, I ALWAYS do so privately even after release unless I am asked directly about it. Friendship and criticism are a hard mix at the best of times, and a nearly impossible one when made a public spectacle.<br/><br/>Again, (public) criticism is ALWAYS entangled with status issues.<br/><br/>Another BIG problem is that most people will not feel compelled to criticize until it costs or earns them something (time, money, status), which is why you'll get more feedback about a commercial game than a free prototype. This is just a sad fact of human nature. Even sadder is that people tend to be more honest in their commentary when they're slightly angry, at least when outside the internet.<br/><br/>Now, why to I critique games? Is it because I want to help people design better games? Is it because their work reflects on my own? Not really. I do it because I'm intensely frustrated with the current state of the art, and critiquing other people's work and assimilating the resulting feedback helps ME design better games. If it's entertaining or benefits someone else, more power to them. I think it would be rather arrogant and condescending of me to claim my critical commentary is done in an effort to help those less able to design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195683/#Comment_195683" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T14:26:09+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  2:26PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anon.adderlan</cite>Again, (public) criticism is ALWAYS entangled with status issues.</blockquote>Isn't that like saying, "Whenever you conduct business in New Jersey, it's in New Jersey." ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195690/#Comment_195690" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T14:57:17+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  2:57PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anon.adderlan</cite>So you either have to avoid the issue by making sure all criticism is either anonymous or private, or embrace the issue by making sure giving and accepting well thought out criticism is an action that generates status itself, like on The Forge.</blockquote>\nI don't think anonymous critiques would work.

The problem is that much of online RPG culture focuses not upon playing games but upon buying them.  As a forum member you pick up social capital either by writing games or by keeping up with the joneses and surfing the waves of popularity.  In effect, you buy games because they make you look and feel like the kind of person who plays awesome new cutting edge games.   Even if you haven't actually gamed in decades.<br/><br/>Given those kinds of lines of social credit someone who stands up and says "actually this game sucks" is endangering the whole edifice of generating social credit because if a game IS shit then being the guy who picked it up at gencon and chatted to the writer is not a source of social cachet but of looking like a sucker and a fanboy who falls for marketing buzz.  The social capital to be gained from preventing people from buying bad games is nothing compared to the social capital you are denying others by pulling the plug on the hype-conformism-social capital cycle.<br/><br/>In that kind of hypercommercialised public sphere (to borrow a term from Terry Eagleton), the critic is a public menace.  He's a downer.  A killjoy.<br/><br/>Someone like SteveD is a really good example of what happens in this type of climate.  SteveD is a fantastic evangelist for games.  Buffy and My Life With Master benefited hugely from SteveD talking about how awesome they were.  He even writes up things that pass themselves off as reviews.  He gets shitloads of social cachet because he's the guy who makes everyone else feel good about their consumerism.<br/><br/>In order to have a healthy critical sphere you need to either place a value on honest evaluation OR place a value in criticism as an artform in and of itself.  Indeed, most academic literary critics are not in the business of evaluation at all.  Instead they display interpretative skill and theoretical erudition and earn social capital that way.<br/><br/>So I think the people who are trying to set terms for critical engagement (what the fuck does 'constructive' criticism even mean?) have it the wrong way round.  It's not that game critics aren't focused or disciplined enough, it's that there's no reason whatsoever why they should be and what social capital there is to be gained from reviewing emphatically flows away from honesty and intellectual substance.  The critical culture gaming has at the moment is akin to that of lifestyle journalism and last time I looked nobody in Vogue is picking apart the latest pantsuits or facecreams.<br/><br/>If you want good critics, find a way of changing gamer culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195709/#Comment_195709" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T15:40:41+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  3:40PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting and amusing post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195712/#Comment_195712" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T15:46:29+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  3:46PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>The problem is that much of online RPG culture focuses not upon playing games but upon buying them.

There's no such thing as "X is shit," not when we're talking matters of taste. In fact, framing criticism as "X is shit" is exactly why the culture of criticism people are hoping for is a waste of fucking time.<br/><br/>Real criticism is about analysis. Analysis is never what's on offer, however. Mostly, in my experience, the word "criticism" is used as a thin patina overlaying bullshit posturing and magnification of personal preference into objective fact. I've had enough of that kind of crap in my life, and especially had enough from the geekosphere, which seems to exist to provide this kind of "critique."<br/><br/>If someone wants to honestly do some game analysis, some reasoned critique, then I don't think anyone will have a problem with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195730/#Comment_195730" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T16:55:28+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  4:55PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anonymous criticism only gets interesting if the game's creator is also anonymous.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLow" title="JLow"><img alt="JLow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLow">JLow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195738/#Comment_195738" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T18:49:50+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  6:49PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite><br/><br/>If someone wants to honestly do some game analysis, some reasoned critique, then I don't think anyone will have a problem with it.</blockquote>\nYou split an infinitive there, Rob.  :P<br/><br/>-Julie                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195744/#Comment_195744" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T19:39:23+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  7:39PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fatal is Shit<br/><br/>taste and perspective doesn't change the fact that community agreement can be had. <br/><br/>If the community says its shit, and you still like it, that's fine. Some people like shitty things. <br/><br/>What I don't get is why I have to somehow present reasons to dislike a game more than I have to present reasons to love a game. How many people have 'reasoned' admiration of a game. It seems antithetical, but somehow all criticisim has to follow some rational order of the mind in order to be 'valid'. I can certainly see how reasoned criticism may be easier to act upon(its more transparent because reasoned things generally explain themselves)  but i fail to see how seeing how a group of 16 year old boys won't play your game because it 'sucks balls' and 'makes me want to kill myself' or other rather irrational feelings toward the game is not in itself useful information. <br/><br/>the short

I have a few thoughts on why I feel this way now, though, so thank you.<br/><br/>* Any commentary on art that I'm going to pay attention to must be useful. "I love this shit!" is only slightly more useful to me than "This is shit!" So yes, when people praise something I would prefer more effort put into that, as well.<br/><br/>* I find people talking about the things they love far more interesting, engaging, and intellectually attractive than people whinging about what they dislike.<br/><br/>* I find complaints and cynicism to be easy and lazy. Snark is a commodity that seems not difficult to come by.<br/><br/>* Negativity adds little to my world, positivity adds a lot.<br/><br/>* I prefer that things which people dislike die in quiet ignominy. I don't feel they need to be exhumed and paraded around the public square for people to hurl their rotten vegetables at.<br/><br/>* It seems to me that people who are eager for a "culture of criticism" are uncomfortable with the repercussions their negativity has had (or may have). I'm not that motivated to aid in creating a greenhouse where bile that couldn't survive in the wilderness is protected.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I feel the need to reiterate, as a creative person, that I find critique extremely helpful. I invite anyone to review my shit. It really does help one become a better writer/artist/creator/whatever. However, there's a substantial difference between helpful critique and self-indulgent blowhardism. I think I can actually take both. I just think one is useful, and one isn't.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Another note: for the past several months, I've been endeavoring to restrict myself to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime" rel="nofollow">E-Prime</a> speech when discussing creative works. This is especially important for me to do when I'm talking about things online (though I try to do it face-to-face too unless I'm joking around). I find that these restrictions lead me to talk about creative works--which boil down to matters of taste ultimately--in what I consider to be a more honest way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195785/#Comment_195785" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T02:01:00+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  2:01AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>What I don't get is why I have to somehow present reasons to dislike a game more than I have to present reasons to love a game.

Even if people have absolutely no respect for the position of critic and the skill and experience that goes into being a really good critic, they still like the idea of there being someone who claims to be objective giving out opinions that effectively validate their purchasing decisions.  It's like having Roger Ebert standing outside of the theatre when you come out from seeing Watchmen for the 15th time and telling you you did a good job.  It gives a consumer-slave a nice warm feeling inside.<br/><br/>In this type of climate it's okay to be negative but you have to effectively be pre-empting public opinion.  It's possible to validate people's purchasing decisions but it's also possible to validate their prejudices and groupthink.  This can be achieved by saving up negative criticism for use against safe targets.  Targets in whom people have no social capital invested.  So, for example, you can be as negative as you like about RAHOWA or FATAL.  You can also get social capital from tracking the fine-grained nuances in public opinion so, if at release, you'd gone on RPGnet and put the boot into the Serenity RPG from the point of view that it's nowhere near as good as cinematic Unisystem I think there would have been social capital to be gained there.<br/><br/>Of course, this also means that there's little to be gained from reviewing smaller games with less visibility.  There's not much to be gained from bigging up or putting the boot into something like Grey Ranks as people have no social capital invested in either liking it or hating it so validating people's prejudices one way or the other is likely to net the critic very little kudos.<br/><br/>What's emerging from this discussion is that a lot of people want honesty in their reviews and given that at the moment the vast majority of online reviews are in no way based upon people actually playing the games, I think this is laudable.  However, what we're also seeing is attempts to limit the field of engagement so that you have "constructive" criticism (by which they mean criticism that is useful to them) and not "bile" (by which they mean criticism that is harmful to their best interests).<br/><br/>I would argue that a healthy critical culture is based upon a principle of maximum candour.  You can't have proper criticism without the odd dressing down.  I particularly enjoyed Robert's line about "magnification of personal preference into objective fact".  Just as one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist, I'd argue that one man's magnification of personal preference into objective fact is another man's insightful review.<br/><br/>You can't have it both ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195789/#Comment_195789" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T03:16:17+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  3:16AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Full candour's fine in a flourishing and well established media in which there are many creators but I'm not sure that it's quite so useful in a smaller more fragile environment like roleplaying.<br/><br/>And there's always the issue of personal taste.

Not the aims of the industry.  As a person who games regularly and who, once in a blue moon, buys the odd game I don't care about the industry.  It could implode tomorrow and it would have next to no impact upon my life.  Vincent Baker and Jared Sorensen could die penny-less in the snow pursued by ravening dogs and I would not shed one tear.

Writing a critique, even a very nasty one, I find helps sharpen my analytical skills tremendously. Even if it doesn't, I find it quite fun. Must my fun be chained to someone else's interest? I never agreed to that!<br/><br/>Edit: I guess what I'm saying is, since I'm not a game designer and have no desire to be, and god help me if I'm ever just a game consumer, when I write about a game (virtually any time) I am doing so from a critical perspective, or I try to. And saying I oughtn't be negative about such things, or that I should "think of the poor designer", fuck that. I mean seriously, fuck it, why should I? I never promised them anything, I have no agreements with them, they're not giving me anything I haven't already paid them for in order to motivate me to think of their poor selves when I post on the Internet. I absolutely agree the standards for RPG criticism are degraded and mostly ephemeral (review something without playing it? what the fuck? did people not notice that the most popular and one of the greatest RPGs in the world is a horrible, boring read?), so I try to make my critical remarks more substantial, but that's a challenge I set myself in order to be a decent person, not because I have some desire to help "the community".

I'm glad you enjoyed wot stuff you read :-)<br/><br/>I'm not being an absolutist.  I'm saying that different types of public sphere demand different types of criticism.  For example, in the time of someone like Doctor Johnson the role of the critic was to defend public taste by drawing attention to the stuff that was likely to be popular whilst warning people about works that failed to live up to popular taste whatever those tastes might be.  Gaming culture is now commercialised.  Money changes hands.  Given this type of public sphere then it is necessary for a critic to warn people about mis-spending their money.<br/><br/>I would love it for gaming to be more hobby-centric.  I hate the way that gaming has become all about consumerism instead of playing games and writing your own stuff (the absolute worst thing I've seen expressed on a gaming forum was the idea that someone would not play a game with a home-brewed setting because it meant he couldn't buy up all the supplements in order to exploit the GMs inferior knowledge of the setting).  If the public sphere were that way oriented then I agree with you that there's little space for people who are negative or who set out to warn people away from different games.  In such a world picking up a game would cost you nothing and so nothing would be lost if you picked up the wrong one.  But as long as gamers are consumers then consumer advice is necessary.  You can't have people making hundreds of dollars off of games whilst critics sit on their hands and say "well... if you can't say something nice then don't say anything at all".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It would take about five seconds for someone to spot one of my critiques, for example, he said, egotistically.</blockquote>\nAttribution is another status behavior rooted in people's need for authority. And no matter how anonymous a statement is, it WILL be attributed to someone, usually an individual with particular status/popularity. Hence we have the Arrogant Worms posting lists of songs they DON'T sing, and reviewers attributing satirical songs by female artists to Weird Al.<br/><br/>I myself have been accused of writing scathing commentary I didn't, simply because I'm the guy who does that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>It's not that game critics aren't focused or disciplined enough, it's that <b>there's no reason whatsoever why they should be and what social capital there is to be gained from reviewing emphatically flows away from honesty and intellectual substance</b>.  The critical culture gaming has at the moment is akin to that of lifestyle journalism and last time I looked nobody in Vogue is picking apart the latest pantsuits or facecreams.</blockquote>\nMost criticism is like this wherever you go, and as much performance art as objective analysis.

How many people have 'reasoned' admiration of a game.</blockquote><blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Any commentary on art that I'm going to pay attention to must be useful. "I love this shit!" is only slightly more useful to me than "This is shit!" So yes, when people praise something I would prefer more effort put into that, as well.</blockquote>\nIt is extremely hard for people to elucidate why they love a thing, and doing so often leads them to love it less. It is also much easier to describe how something does not live up to one's expectations than it is to describe something that surpasses them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Snark is a commodity that seems not difficult to come by.</blockquote>\nWhile the internet is indeed littered with snark, quality snark is anything BUT common.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>You can also get social capital from tracking the fine-grained nuances in public opinion so, if at release, you'd gone on RPGnet and put the boot into the Serenity RPG from the point of view that it's nowhere near as good as cinematic Unisystem I think there would have been social capital to be gained there.</blockquote>\nHow did you KNOW?<br/><br/>*ahem*, what I mean is, I didn't make this comparison at release, but it is a reasonable one to make.<br/><br/>The thing is that to effectively criticize something, you need to have a model to compare it to. The problem is that most people cannot codify their tastes into a model which would allow them to do this. And ultimately you can't, because while you can explain how one kind of a thing is crap, you can't explain why you like that kind of thing in the first place.<br/><br/>In the case of Serenity, there were several ways in which it failed to be a game for non-gamers, appeal to fans of the show, and emulate the feel of the movie.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>I much prefer Ken Hite's approach where he will only review things he likes, not that he has to like them wholeheartedly but they have to have something to recommend.</blockquote>\nWhile good in theory, lots of people seem unable to objectively analyze something they like a lot. Like a little, maybe.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>All game players are (at least proto-)designers, certainly all those playing these games. The player-designer division is false, and as such, we have many designers, we are drowning in designers.</blockquote>\nCompletely true, though you would think this environment would lead to better criticism, wouldn't you?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>As a gamer I regret the fact that when I want to learn more about a game I have to wade through 20 reviews written by people who haven't played the fucking thing.</blockquote>\nThis is exactly why specific reviewers get read more often than others.<br/><br/>Of course that kind of system fails when you take status OUT of the mix. Now there's no way to seek out a responsible, honest, and capable reviewer who shares your tastes.<br/><br/>I think it's interesting to look at how Apple is handling this issue at the AppStore. Before they took action, many reviews were submitted by rival developers, or people who never even used the application. I'm curious as to how effective they can be at stemming bad (as in inaccurate and libelous) reviews.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196167/#Comment_196167" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T09:17:23+00:00" title="March  8, 2009  9:17AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Status Status Status Blah Blah Blah<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is this knife fight?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196169/#Comment_196169" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T10:09:04+00:00" title="March  8, 2009 10:09AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2009 10:12AM by Graham.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you would say that, Ralph.

I kind of have to agree with GB steve, in that there is some productivity somewhere here, and although I don't think the original aim (building a social environment for criticism, if that is what it is) is possible I think the criticism talk itself has been useful. So I'm going to recap a bit of the OP with some of my own thoughts in here, and hope if i blow hard enough the seeds will scatter ( I was thinking of a dandelion) <br/><br/>Op's reasons why this is badwrongfun<br/><b><br/>1. The Internet Makes This Tough<br/><br/>2. Criticism is Inherently Caught Up in Status Games<br/><br/>3. Focusing on Game Texts Before People is Backwards<br/><br/>4. The Community is Only as Strong as Our Relationships<br/></b><br/>and some counterpoints from myself. <br/><br/>cp1. yes the internet makes this tought, see thread for reasons  why, but it is also a great enabler. Between being able to say more or less anything and various degrees of anonymity you have a pretty great engine for feedback and discussion of all kinds, even if that includes undesireible kinds. <br/><br/>cp2. I agree with the op, and I have no reason why this either makes it harder to do criticism. Those status games are more or less a requirement for a 'social environment' and help ensure that 'criticism is recieved' because the critics are litterally being payed in status. <br/><br/>cp3. All I can say is when we are talking about games how is focusing on games before the people backwards. This one bugs me the most because I really feel it clashes with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. If we're focusing on the game text thats wrong but if we are focusing on the people, we're playing status games. All i know is that chances are I will never see more of you than what I can count on one hand, and talk to only a small percentage of the community over these crazy electronic contraptions. I cannot focus on the person because I don't know them except their text. <br/><br/>cp4. Is it? If it is, so what? The OP was talking about a 'social environment' when in fact I believe he rather wanted a community. That's not horrible but entirely different. I don't believe that Story Games is a community. I Think some people with the 'status' would like it to be, but its not. Wouldn't a community consist of indivudals who do more than interact with each other when and how they want?<br/><br/>I hope more people, Read this thread and rather than posting here start new threads.

I think that producing reviews that are nothing but critiques of a game's text is a complete waste of time.  Games exist to be played and the only way in which it is possible to gain useful and practical insight into a game's published text is by doing with said text what you're supposed to do with it; namely play it.  Reviews based upon text alone are like reviews of restaurants based upon listings of the fat and sugar content of the food.  You can gain SOME insight into the food (namely is it fattening or not) but the most important component of that food (namely what it tastes like) simply does not get addressed if you write your review from that perspective.<br/><br/>Personally, from the point of view of productivity, I'd be interested to know if people are thinking of refining the existing model for RPG reviewing (which could be done by setting up a website with tighter editorial control) or whether people are talking about setting up a critical community similar to that of the Forge.  The thread title implies the second but a lot of the discussion seems to have flowed towards the first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196432/#Comment_196432" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T13:14:25+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  1:14PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2009 1:19PM by Valamir.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, ultimately the final review of a game comes down to actual play.  But there are a number of fundamentals that come from the text.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo continue with your analogy, for a person who is a vegan or is gluten intolerant analysis of the menu can determine whether its even worthwhile to GO to that restaurant.  Only after that basic hurdle is exceeded does the taste of the food matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly with a role playing text there are certain fundamental questions that can be answered by the text.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot play the game without someone having learned the game.  If you are learning the game from the text then the text must convey certain procedural requirements that enable play to happen.  Evaluating the quantity and quality of how well the text conveys that information does not require actual play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, actual play can often obfuscate the very thing you're trying to evaluate.  If the rules don't contain critical information but your group is capable of "just winging it" and inventing a solution on the fly so that play can continue, and you go on to have fun...how do you review that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my view that's an example of successful play and a failed text.  Too often reviews based on actual play focus on the success of play and forget (or never even realize) how much of that success came from the group's own play talent rather than the quality of the text's communication.  This is a problem, because it is not reliably reproduceable.  Other groups may not have the same ability to just wing their way to a solution.  Or perhaps they do...but the solution they wing their way to was completely different from yours and totally incompatable with how the game plays.  Such a review...one that ignores the quality of the textual communication...actually failed to convey the information that was necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf what one is trying to evaluate is "does this text give me sufficient information to play without having to make up a significant number of procedures myself" then actual play is entirely not necessary to this.  It can be helpful it that it can identify edge cases that come up in play but that you hadn't thought of while reading the rules...but if the rules are completely devoid of even the basic cases, this becomes immediately clear just from reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  The rules say "Players determine the next scene and play continues".<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't need actual play to immediately see the questions that will need to be answered in order for play to happen:  namely WHO determines, and HOW do they determine it.  Is it by consensus?  If so, what happens if consensus can't be reached?  Is it the GM? If so is the GM expected to incorporate other players' ideas as standard procedure?  Is it whichever player has a good idea?  If so, what happens if two players have good ideas that are incompatable.  Is the answer to all these questions...just talk it out until you reach a decision?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever the answer is, it should be stated in the text somewhere nearby.  If not, then my group will have to invent the answer ourselves.  Because play literally CANNOT happen AT ALL without an answer.  SOMEBODY in the real time event of actual play will have to actually speak words and have those words carry weight and be accepted.  If the rules don't give guidance for who that somebody is...we'll have to figure out a method ourselves.  This is true of the game designers own group, as well.  Somebody actually spoke words that allowed play to happen.  Basic rules writing 101 says "be sure to identify how those things happened at your table and write about them in your text"<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't need actual play to be able to identify that this information is missing from the text, any more than a vegan needs to actually eat a steak to know that's made of meat.<br/>\n<br/>\nReviews that focus only on a game's text?  Not a complete picture...but definitely not a complete waste of time either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196485/#Comment_196485" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T17:23:38+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  5:23PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am of the "only actual play reviews are really worth anything" camp, yet I agree with Ralph's analysis. How can this be?!?! Maybe I am a contradictory SOB and I should change my mind on something. Let's see.<br><br>At <i>some point</i> the text is not going to tell you things, at some point your group's own procedures and (more important in some cases) actual contributions are going to take over. It doesn't matter how detailed the game is, eventually you are going to have to make a character, say "I pick the lock" or "I want to roll my Angst score" and right there everything the designer has done is for naught and probably they would hate what you just said.<br><br>What a decent RPG review will produce (beyond the usual 'hay there are a lot of grammatical errorz' or 'teh art is niec' junk, which is the content of most non-actual-play reviews) is a detailed story of how you got from the text to the game. Did you get stuck on anything? (A bad procedure!) Did you miss something? (A hole!) Did you find something that you shouldn't have?  (An exploit!)  What did you do?  Was it cool? If something wasn't cool, what happened?  If something was cool, what happened? ...and so on.<br><br>I gave an example in my other thread of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8462" rel="nofollow">an "all-thief" AD&amp;D game</a>, and how it was nothing at all like the "standard" AD&amp;D game. Could we still have produced a decent critique of AD&amp;D if we'd done an "all-thief" campaign? Of course we could!  In fact, we did!  We analyzed the hell out of that game, and AD&amp;D, and how they related, and I thought about it for years after!<br><br>But what is the value of such a critique?  Why do I say that's the only critique worth reading?  That kind of critique has no commercial value.  Nobody is going to read it and go "oh, well, it sounds like AD&amp;D is worth twenty dollars" (or whatever).  Nobody is going to read it and go "oh, well, the designers of AD&amp;D sure did a good job there".  Maybe that is what Ralph is getting at? The OP? I don't really know.<br><br>The value of such a critique is in improving <i>play</i>, both our own (through analysis, expression and response) and other people's.  Plenty of people who we talked about it with said "that sounds fucking great" and came up with their own one-class AD&amp;D play and had a good time with it.  Certainly it was neither what the designers intended under any reasonable definition of intent, nor was it anything they disallowed. Hell, the critique can be beneficial even if we never played AD&amp;D again! And that is fucking amazing.<br><br>I guess the reason I only put value on actual-play critiques is because I'm a player, not a designer and please God, please don't ever, ever let me just be a consumer. Of anything.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8783/building-a-social-environment-for-criticism/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8783/building-a-social-environment-for-criticism">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8783/building-a-social-environment-for-criticism/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8783/building-a-social-environment-for-criticism/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8783/building-a-social-environment-for-criticism/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8783%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8783%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
