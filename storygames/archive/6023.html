First, the concept and inspirations:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>WOEBEGONE</b><br/>\n<i>Are you strong enough to lift a spirit?</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIf no one can see the stars beyond the lights of the city, will anyone notice when one of them goes missing? A star has fallen to earth with the hopes of secretly helping ease some of the troubles it saw from above. It manifests as a boy or girl, but found itself in need of help, and asks for assistance from dreamers it encounters, which are the characters. With the characters acting like both caretakers and friends (like in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotsuba&amp;!" rel="nofollow">Yotsuba</a>), they set about secretly helping people (like in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelie" rel="nofollow">Amelie</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_iron" rel="nofollow">3 Iron</a>), and also helping to lift the star's heavy heart so that it may return to the heavens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe world of Endless City is inspired by the illustrations by <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tksn.web.infoseek.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">Imperial Boy</a>. It's not a world filled with magic or great danger, but a lot of rather odd characters. My intention is to make the game seem very playful and always hovering near the edge of fantasy, but the star will be the only thing that is truly magical. There will actually be several stars for the gamemaster to choose from, and which one is chosen will shape the campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the system, I want adapt a kid's cardgame that can be played with regular playing cards to give a playful feel to the game. I also want to avoid cardgames that are regularly associated with gambling, like poker or blackjack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus far I've come up with, or had suggested, the following possible games:<br/>\nWar, Go Fish, UNO, Old Maid, Rook, Canasta, Rummy, Crazy Eights, Slapjack, Hearts<br/>\nDoes anyone know any other playing card games they played as a kid that I might look into?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134787/#Comment_134787" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T04:30:52+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  4:30AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Cheat" was my favorite game as a kid.  There are lots of variants.  The object is to get rid of all the cards in your hand.  One player leads, and then players take turns to play a higher card on top of it.  If the first player leads a pair or triple, you can only play a higher pair or triple on it.  If no one can play on the trick, the highest card wins it, and that player leads the next trick.  The winner is the first person to lose their hand.<br><br>The catch is that the cards are all played face down, and the player says what they're playing.  If someone calls "cheat", you look at the played cards.  If they're what the player said they were, the player who called "cheat" must pick up the stack of played cards.  If the player was cheating, then that player must pick up the cards.<br><br>Maybe not what you're looking for, but I have many fond memories of that game.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.
