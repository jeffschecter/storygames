                    Right, I want this conversation out of the shadow of Brain Damage. <br/><br/>What are your opinions about the ability of the common person in modern western society to tell a story? To recognize a story? <br/><br/>I suppose we should also talk about what we consider a story and not. Is a story of the day (an anecdote) a story? Is a joke a story? Is a novel a story? Are all novels stories? <br/><br/>Lets have this one out here, so that we can keep the other threads from becoming mires of crossed messages. <br/><br/>For my initial take on the matter, it's all <a href="http://yudhishthirasdice.blogspot.com/2006/01/naturalism-story-of-day-and-rpgs.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note that I think of story in a very wide sense, and from a rhetoic/communication background as well as an English background. If we want to get into discussions of specific types of stories (novel or screenwriting, for example) my answers will change.                </div>

<p>I think that the ability to tell and understand a story was the evolutionary leap that put humans into a different category than animals, and it's intrinsic to our life. Having a damaged ability to tell and comprehend stories is the definition of mental illness.</p>
<p>So, that's my take.</p>

                            Well, I guess I'll just repost my comment from the other thread, for completeness' sake. Other than that, I once more happen to be in agreement with Brand.<br/>
<br/>
I have three kids (well, two stepkids I've been raising for the past six years and one toddler). The older two are 11 and 13. Their natural tendency in storytelling is to ramble and include every single detail. They don't know how to summarize. They don't even remotely have an idea of what a theme or premise is. When they tell you what went on in the latest Simpsons episode, they make sure to tell you not only every word of dialogue (and interrupt each other to say nuh-uh, that's not what he said), they also, in the middle of telling the story, reach back to tell you all the previous things that happened so you have the proper context. In short, they don't possess a natural ability to filter out the "core story."<br/>
<br/>
Now, you might say: Yes, but they're kids! True. But how are they going to get to the point where they can understand and relate the core of a story? They need to learn it. In fact, since we're homeschooling, Lisa and I need to teach them.<br/>
<br/>
That's one anecdotal piece of evidence. Now, the other pieces in my anecdotal chest come from being an aspiring author who has been to workshops and writing groups--and from my own learning process regarding stories. I can now, finally, distill a premise from a story, but I'm still not highly proficient in it. And most aspiring writers I've met are terrible at that and at most other aspects of writing a good story.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that's not a bad thing. In fact, I frequently have to argue with assholes who think that writing is somehow a "talent" and you either have it or you don't (like Darren did on the Forge, and in response to which I wrote him a private message). That's utter bullshit. Storytelling is a craft; in fact, it's a larger field with several sub-crafts. It can be learned by just about anyone, but it's always hard work. Even for people who seem "gifted", they need to practice and edit and spend a lot of time on making a good story.<br/>
<br/>
Now, maybe that's not the level of proficiency we're talking about here. But even the basics, when people are told and go "ahh yes, conflict and characters and resolution and change", are not that easy to translate into actively creating a story.<br/>
<br/>
That all said: while I disagree that most people have a natural talent for storytelling, I agree that so-called storytelling games have tended to muddy the waters, give people bad habits, and overall created what I like to non-confrontationally refer to as "preconceived or conditioned notions" about how (storytelling) play should go. Getting those out of people's brains is hard work. Empowering them to actually focus on the story instead of those built-up artifacts will take time and energy, but most of all, probably more of a cooperative rather than an incinerating approach.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening :)<br/>

                            I'm getting tired of the word "story" because it's quickly coming to the same place I keep words like "nice" and "like" -- communicatively useless.<br/><br/>Can the common man of Western society recognize narrative structure (conflict, rising action, climax, denouement)?  Meh, maybe.  Not necessarily with those words but, given basic education, they can probably say "this guy was against this guy, and this happened and then <em>this</em> happened, and then the first guy did this-and-such to win, and then he got the girl."<br/><br/>There are two leaps, however, to make.  The first, harder-but-smaller leap is from being able to recognize these things happening in a story to recognizing that those are the essential parts of a story.  The easier-but-bigger leap is then, when creating or retelling a story, to include these things in the telling.<br/><br/>Your story-of-the-day, Brand, is usually lacking a climax or denouement -- although in my experience, the story-of-the-day is usually just bitching about how the person was abused (conflict and rising action).<br/><br/>Note that I'm coming from a background without much respect for the common man -- I used to teach middle school.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Well the definition of story is, in fact, improtant. As you say by your Aristotalian-logic-chopping mode of definition the story of the day is not a story. However, by the communcative definition of a contained and artifical recreation of events, it is. <br/><br/>So which definition shall we use? <br/><br/>Though, it is worth noting that Christians kids aren't telling a story in either definition -- the literal redacation of events per say is not a story. Of course kids in middle school are also a questionable case, as 12 year olds are only entering the stage where they have a fully formed ego-complex, so the fact that most of them aren't good at creating stories (which are largely shaped by fusions of self and not-self) isn't surprising. <br/><br/>Do most 30 year olds have the same problem?                        </div>

                            Chris, <br/><br/>The point is to, once we have some basics on the ground, get back to talking about how games make stories. <br/><br/>Because if normal people can tell stories then we're good -- we just need to make games that tell them how to do that in this particular way to get the exact effect we want our game to have. <br/><br/>If normal people can't do that, however, we have to do a fuck lot more work.<br/><br/>We also might want to think about the types of stories we want people to tell with our games. For example, if you take the story of the day as a model for what your game will do, you will need a different systemic structure to support it than if you go with the classical Aristotalian model. <br/><br/>Josh's note about the lack of resolution is correct on that count, and just take a moment to think about what it says about story and games if you do or do not need resoultion and falling action to make a story.                        </div>

                            Just to toss this out there, to see how the act of observation changes that observed, here are some definitions from the Bedford Glossary of Critical and Literary Terms that I had lying about from my grad-school days: <br/><br/><b>Story</b>: A narrative of events ordered chronologically. <br/><br/><b>Narrative</b>: A story or a telling of a story, or an account of a situation or events.<br/><br/><b>Plot</b>: The arrangement and interrelation of events in a narrative work, chosen and designed to engage the readers attention and interest (or even to around suspense or anxiety) while also providing a framework for the exposition of the author's message, or theme, and for other elements such as characterization, symbol, and conflict. <br/><br/>Plot is distingueshed from story, which referes to a narrative of events, due to an emphasis on establishing causality. Story is the raw material from which plot is constructed. Crafting a plot requires chosing not only which elements of the story in include, but also relating the evtns of a story to one another so that causality may be established conciningly. As E.M. Forester explained, to say "the kind died and the queen died" is to tell a story. Adding three words, "The king died and then the queen died of grief" transforms the story into a plot by including an emphasizing causality. <br/><br/>So, are we all saying that people can tell stories, some people can tell good stories, but that many people have trouble constructing a plot?                        </div>

                            Brand, I didn't say that narrative structure constituted a story.  Go reread my post; I very explicitly did not attempt to define "story" because I find it rather futile.<br/><br/>I don't think I'd really ever call anything a "good story" -- I'd say "that film had interesting character development" or "the novel offers an intriguing allegory to modern politics" or "the narrative structure of that show was fascinatingly complex."<br/><br/>It's like saying something was a "good meal" -- is there any way for that <em>not</em> to be an idiosyncratic statement about personal preference?                        </div>

                            So Joshua, are you suggesting that when we create games we need to not think about what we are doing with story, but instead think about the ways in which we want to use specific techniques in order to create specific effects with the game?                        </div>

                            Two quick points about 'story-making' in rpgs:<br/>
<br/>
First: I think people are reasonably competant at making narrative--maybe not very good narrative, but there you go.  <br/>
<br/>
However, rpgs are not about telling stories, they are about telling stories _collaboratively_, with _other people_.  Everyday practice with this: not so much beyond brief sketch comedy.  Transferability of other skills--patchy at best.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings us to:<br/>
<br/>
Two: Much of the coherent narrative creation that goes on around a gaming table isn't communicated.  It's in people's heads--they are doing their darndest to make a coherent and enjoyable story out of the stuff that happens at the table, and that stuff includes both in-game SIS and out of game system mechanics.  Tends to make a mess.<br/>
<br/>
The worse the game experience, the more the players do this editing of experience.  Because they are desperate to make a good story, and they'll do what it takes.  Which, of course, usually hurts the game as a whole.                        </div>

                            A tangent that hearkens back to the titling of of the site:<br/><br/>"Story" may certainly be poorly defined and none too descriptive of what we do -- but is "game" any better?<br/><br/>I make a conscious effort to avoid the word "game" in the text of my game-in-development, because I want to escape its competitive connotations. I use "story" as a substitute, not because it is any more accurate than "game," but because its connotations are at least creative and narrative.<br/><br/>Of course, these discussions are making me consider finding some third term.                        </div>

                            My thoughts are basically in agreement with Clinton in terms of context, but I also think that the complete, conscious destruction of any sort of oral tradition has essentially led to people who, while capable of seeing and understanding stories, are basically incapable of making their own, or even retelling the ones that they have seen without training.<br/>
<br/>
Used to be storytelling was a pretty common activity, like music, dance, or cooking.  Now, for most people, the ability is atrophied, though not necessarily beyond repair.  The similarity between writer's training and physical therapy is not a coincidence.<br/>
