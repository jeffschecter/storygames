I need all this information to be complete before the end of June (though ideally before the end of this WEEK would be awesome).<br/><br/>Here's the information from the spreadsheet:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.deadlyfredly.com/gencon07/menuitems.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.deadlyfredly.com/gencon07/menuitems.htm</a><br/><br/><b>If you are participating in the Forge Booth, it is <i>vital</i> that you check the above URL and look over your information to ensure it will be accurate.</b> I've got somewhere around 15 publishers whose information is incomplete, so there's a statistically strong chance that if you're a part of the booth, you need to give this a look!<br/><br/>Please also note that in an effort to build a complete price-list, my pull from the IPR product database was somewhat indiscriminate.  I don't (yet) know how complete of a catalog IPR will be bringing to the convention, though I do believe the intention is to have at least a few copies of everything.  If you're a "worrier" like me and you want to be sure your game *is* brought, make sure to contact IPR and say so, just to keep it on IPR's radar (that said, if you've participated in past years and Brennan brought your stuff and you were satisfied with that, you probably have nothing to worry about this year).  <br/><br/>I've also indicated on here where products are currently (June 6th) listed out-of-stock at IPR.  If you're expecting IPR to supply your games, take this as a nudge to set your plans in motion to make sure IPR has your game in stock throughout the summer convention season!<br/><br/>If you have any updates, corrections, concerns, or questions about this list, <b>please contact me ASAP at evilhat AT gmail DOT com</b>.  I'm going to start work on the menu tonight, so the sooner you get me any new info, the better!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74173/#Comment_74173" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T04:10:23+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  4:10AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dead of Night is down in italics.

That's something that Gregor would have to check with Ron Edwards about.  I'm not in charge of determining what games can and can't be listed on the menu.  I'm sure Gregor can still demo the game, but I'm unclear as to whether or not the "advertised demos" of the menu are meant as a booth member privilege.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74191/#Comment_74191" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T07:05:19+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  7:05AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this is up to Ron.
