Also, when I'm playtesting a game, I usually have all my notes and drafts on my computer and don't really want to print out stuff that I know will change. I will usually turn off the wireless, though.<br/><br/>Also, in response to the "I don't like distracting things at the table" - I'm one of those people that needs to be doing something with my hands when I'm sitting down. It's like my mind doesn't work if I'm not doing something -else-. So if I'm not actually talking or making a decision, I doodle, or look at the book, or check my text messages when I get them. It doesn't mean I'm not listening or engaged. It just means I can't sit there and listen to other people speak without doing something else with my body.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239418/#Comment_239418" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T08:53:47+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  8:53AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2009 8:54AM by jenskot.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">@jessecoombs</a>: "Can't they just tell me?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish they would.

Whether they are worth the distraction potential or not depends on the system, the game, or both. For particularly long running games, with lots of characters, locations and politics, it definitely helped both the players and the GM to be able to search for stuff. For crunchy systems, particularly those that use a lot of stacked effects, it definitely helped tracking stuff. (I don't think I'd bother running a d20 game without <a href="http://matthewhutton.com/software/dd-manager/" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Manager</a>, for example, and running Exalted combats is about three times faster when the Storyteller rolls and math are done by machine with a simple python script.)<br/><br/>Being able to search PDFs is also vastly superior to page flipping to find something.<br/><br/>Otherwise, for games that don't need any of these things (which, face it, is pretty much every indie game), they are not really helpful.

Where one player clearly gives singular attention when remote, another clearly is multitasking.

A screen is used because players like not knowing what their PC's don't (and several have good talent for reading upside down), though people are entitled to have dice rolled in open.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239485/#Comment_239485" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T12:38:42+00:00" title="October 28, 2009 12:38PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2009 12:39PM by kevperrine.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't get the hate either...<br/><br/>Perhaps it's because for me (and the players I game with) laptops have become a natural part of living, life and fun.  So they're not distracting and they don't draw eyes, etc...<br/>I'm not saying my group couldn't play without laptops - the game is still the same game.  But they only add to my groups' gaming experiences.  They're a tool like the old DM notebook or reference books or CD players, etc...<br/>We use out laptops for:<br/><br/>-  character creation  (from Excel spreadsheet character builders to WotC's DDI)<br/>-  players chronicling game events<br/>-  playlist for great musics during game<br/>-  instant information access (google, wikipedia, etc...)<br/>-  instant imagery (from stored files to quick google-image searches)<br/>-  PDF access/search<br/>-  online rule search  (WotC's Compendium,  SRD,  etc...)<br/>-  calculators for experience points, etc...<br/>-  quick printed props on the fly  (copy/paste info or pix into a Word Doc and print without skipping a beat)<br/>-  Wiki, Wiki, Wiki  (I create a new Wiki Campaign Bible for EVERY campaign I run, for myself and players to add to - unbelievably better than any other resource I use)<br/>-  "blue-booking" via wiki  (this happens between games but it's handy to reference during)<br/>-  video skype with distant players  (only done this 3-4 times and wouldn't want to deal regularly but it works amazingly well)<br/><br/><br/>I don't like the idea of using a laptop as a GM Screen though...  I'm not much a Screen guy anyway - but I can't imagine the keyboard taking up space in front of me.  I usually have my laptop off to the side.<br/>I also know the limits of laptops and how searching for that "perfect song" CAN be a game hazard.  So I usually consciously relegate my searches for info to a similar amount of time I'd search a book.  Less than 1-2 minutes.  Otherwise it IS a distraction - but NOT for the sake of it being a laptop alone...  It's just taking up my time like any other source/tool that could be better spent getting back into game and going without the "perfect" thing.<br/><br/><br/>One of my friends (player) constantly refers to the "Robocracy" taking over our gaming,  but it's more because he's not so great with computers and has had bad experiences with them in life...  But even he has begun to use character builders, Excel builders, our campaign wiki,  etc...  and enjoys it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239489/#Comment_239489" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T12:51:59+00:00" title="October 28, 2009 12:51PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, anecdotal experience here:  I played with a GM who brought stuff in on his laptop, and even kept track of monster-stats (particularly hit-points) on his laptop.<br/><br/>At first this was <i>freaking annoying</i>!

For some rules light games, it's overkill, but I can always use it to show images and play music or sound effects (In one group, I made the players jump a mile during a horror game with a well-timed scream).<br/><br/>I create programs that help smooth over tedious parts of the game. In one game of Pendragon, I used it to manage player estates-  the players sat at the computer, and made the important decisions (do I build a new manor, go raiding, or whatever), and clicked buttons and saw what happened. Normally, this is something that you have to set aside a full session for, but with the computer it's something we could do when it was needed and none of the players minded giving up rolling dice for those things (though if they'd wanted to, I'd setit up so that they could manually input their dice rolls and let the computer roll all the rest).<br/><br/>I also use tablesmith and have things like lists of place and people names, so if I need one, it spits out a list of 10 or 20 and I pick one and note it in my npc database.<br/><br/>I haven't found any problems with the laptop being a barrier to engaging with the players. I sit at the end of a table and can only put it in front of me, but I certainly don't feel like it's a barrier, and I haven't noticed any difference in interaction from the days before I used a laptop. <br/><br/>I also dreamed when I was younger about having exactly the same kind of table setup as Ralph suggested. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>My players don't use laptops, except when they GM, and I don't bring mine on the rare occasion i'm not GMing. But if a player wanted to use a laptop when I was GMing, as long it was game-related purposes, I wouldn't mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239527/#Comment_239527" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T17:09:27+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  5:09PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GM screens are good and every game that has a GM should have a GM screen.<br/><br/>*arms crossed defiantly*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239528/#Comment_239528" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T17:10:03+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  5:10PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I've found a laptop a lot less intrusive than rulebooks, when I have a decent PDF of the rules.<br/>"What was that rule again?" *thinks of suitable text string, and searches" "Aha, here it is."<br/>A lot quicker in my experience than flipping through pages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EnricPDX" title="EnricPDX"><img alt="EnricPDX" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EnricPDX">EnricPDX</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239548/#Comment_239548" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T20:23:21+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  8:23PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2009 8:24PM by EnricPDX.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't imagine needing a laptop for any of the indie games I've played, but three of the five people in the D&amp;D 3.5 game I'm playing in bring their computers.

For a lot of the stuff I use the laptop for during the middle of game I have a remote so I don't even need to lean over or anything. Like Dylan, I also usually have some kind of slideshow screensaver going that shows pictures from the game (PC and NPC pics, locations, whatever) so that if folks are looking at it, they're at least looking at stuff that's from the game. <br/><br/>Which reminds me, the other thing I do with media in general, but doubly so with the laptop, is to have some organization and treat it as a presentation tool. I always have a discrete set of playlists, short and manageable, on a player that I'm familiar with so that I don't spend time messing about with searches. (Also, playlists done right work much like a soundtrack in a movie or TV show, and add a consistency to the aesthetic of the game.) Similarly, I always have a small number of well labeled folders, and a slideshow or presentation program, that has all the images, maps, and/or Google Maps that I'm most likely to use. It takes very little time to set that sort of thing up, and vastly reduces the amount of time you spend fiddling with the machine. Keeping a focus on the tool being something used to present and enhance, rather than giving a new high-tech way to dither, is generally a good thing. <br/><br/>Folks have occasionally talked about setting up a network at the table (we all have wifi), but we've never actually done it. I think it would probably lead to a bit too much behind the screen time for us. As it is the one laptop is usually more than enough. If we played games with heavier rules sets, more might be nice, but as is one is enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ldd23" title="ldd23"><img alt="ldd23" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ldd23">ldd23</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239614/#Comment_239614" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T10:07:11+00:00" title="October 29, 2009 10:07AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a>: When I use mine I do typically put it off to the side or fold it mostly closed when I'm not actively using it for reference or note-taking.<br/><br/>When I ran or played games in friends' houses, we did a lot of gaming around coffee tables, so I could leave the laptop open and in front of me there without it getting in the way because the table is lower.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239629/#Comment_239629" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T11:09:43+00:00" title="October 29, 2009 11:09AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought about this for a while, and I think I've realized that I'm just not that big of a fan of laptops/iphones/pda's etc. when socializing with other people, regardless of what activity we are or aren't pursuing.

I can position the laptop to my side and see it fine, without blocking view of the players. Plus, it's connected by network to a big monitor behind me (off to the side - I don't block their view), so I can pop up images on that monitor for the players to see easily. They can get up and look closely if they want, which they might if I show a map, but for landscapes or portraits or mood pictures, they don't need to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239680/#Comment_239680" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T21:22:17+00:00" title="October 29, 2009  9:22PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lester mentioned smaller laptops ("netbooks") as a possible way to reduce the annoyance factor. I have one, an Asus N10, at the table every time we game, and it's not intrusive at all because it's so short. We mostly use it to record audio. One of the guys I game with has a pretty cool <a href="http://www.bluemic.com/snowball/" rel="nofollow">field-recording-grade outboard omni USB microphone</a>, also present for every session, which is a little more intrusive but tolerated because it makes such clean recordings. I guess the combination of rarely having the screen on, small size, and high utility more than makes up for the blinkenlights and potential for distraction.<br/><br/>I typically use my smartphone rather than the laptop for on-the-fly lookup of facts, precisely because it's small and doesn't need to come above the level of the table. It's even less distracting than the netbook.<br/><br/>Actual game-changing tech: <a href="http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/products/prod_ew.html" rel="nofollow">2' x 3' Post-It pads</a>. The laptop is helpful; the giant freaking paper that stays put on the table is paradigm-shifting. It turns games tactile, and literally gets your thoughts out where the whole group can see them. This really puts that first 'S' in 'SIS'.  We use Mr Sketch markers, the ones with the foodlike smells, for a more total sensory experience. There's plenty of room for an r-map, sketches, lots of notes, scene summaries, "we owe", or whatever state you need to keep generally visible. Can't recommend this highly enough. When I saw that demo of D&amp;D played on a multitouch surface, I couldn't help but think of the kind of experience I was already having with my outsized sticky notes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239697/#Comment_239697" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T02:15:26+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  2:15AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2009 4:14AM by johnzo.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding twitter: I understand that it is possible to tweet photos.

For example, I've thought of <a href="http://asteroid.divnull.com/2005/06/wasting-money/" rel="nofollow">running a game where laptops were required</a>, but that premise was a bit more like an on-line game conducted face to face.<br/><br/>For certain games, the notion of using machine to chat within the group might be powerful. Seems like there would be three types of message that would be used: player-to-player(s), player-to-gm, gm-to-player(s). As an example, in a game based on a lot of secrets, or where every action had ulterior motives, you could so something where you (as a player) declare your action aloud to the group, then send a message to the GM about what you are <i>really</i> doing.<br/><br/>Another idea would be in something like an espionage game, where the GM could "upload" stuff to you display.<br/><br/>Yet another would be something where the notion of computer game and role-playing game mix slightly. For example, in games that use countdowns, maybe the laptops are involved in displaying/triggering/advancing the countdown in some way.<br/><br/>I suppose this has wandered off the point.<br/><br/>Back to the aforementioned ass-pounding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239769/#Comment_239769" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T09:34:53+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  9:34AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So really the question isn't "should we?" but rather "how far?" <br/><br/>The guys catching up with their email or checking in on their investment portfolio?

When I got rid of the screen and set the books off to one side -- within easy reach if I had to look stuff up, but not serving as a barrier between me and the other people at the table -- I was able to function like a normal, social human being again.<br/><br/>Using a laptop off to the side works the same way, it just takes up less space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239911/#Comment_239911" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T11:17:13+00:00" title="October 31, 2009 11:17AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>Given this pattern, rational arguments for the usefulness of the blasted things just sound to me like a lot of hooey.</blockquote>\nActually, it sounds to me that those over 35 don't see them as useful over traditional references and that you're probably one of them.

I modified it so it would work for a modern city, and brought it on my little notebook to a session with some of my old gamer friends.
