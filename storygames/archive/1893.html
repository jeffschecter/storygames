Jesse, elaborate on this one for me?  I get the gist of it, but I'd like to hear if you've developed the distinction any further in your head.                </div>

                            Sure, but I'm going to have to go all Big Model on you.  What I'm talking about is a Technique viewed from two different camera angles, Story Now vs. Step On Up.  I'm labeling the camera angles.  The technique by itself is the same: Characters within the fiction are in pusuit of something.  But what role does that pursuit play in the game as a whole?  Arbitarily I make a distincition between a Character Goal and Scenario Objective although the source of either may be exactly the same within the created fiction.<br/><br/>I tend to think of a character goal as something the character I've created is invested in achieving.  In our Sailing To Atlantis game that was the resurection of my characters dead wife.  But as a player I want the situation at hand to question, threaten and otherwise tax that goal as an opportunity for me to say something thematically about my character and that goal.  Success and failure are important but they aren't the defining feature.  I personally like striving for success with my characters and their goals but failure often results in equally awesome things from a character viewpoint.  Again, our Sailing to Atlantis is an excelent example where I failed misserably but the result was the creation of another character opportunity.<br/><br/>A Scenario Objective on the other hand is something in which success and failure are directly linked to me as a player.  Again I want the situation to threaten and tax this goal but for purposes of showing off my ability to surmount those threats.  If the character fails, I, the player have failed.  I've lost the game, so to speak.  Many, Many D&amp;D scenarios are setup like this.  Go to this dungeon and retrieve the challice of Moonshadow or whatever.<br/><br/>Now again my labels are rather arbitrary.  I made them up specific to that discussion at hand because I wanted to make a distinction between a personal character goal and the fact that the World's Largest Dungeon may provide objectives that the players are expected pursue.  I find having character goals AND scenario objectives at the same time is bad news.  That very situation very nearly killed my Ravenloft campaign as the players increasingly ignored the scenario at hand for the personal character drama that was developing between themselves.  As the GM I was very nearly cut out of participation in the game at all.<br/><br/>It's entirely possible to have a personal character goal like "resurect my dead wife" be treated by a game as a competative objective.  In fact, I'd like to see more games where what the characters within the fiction are trying to achieve are less video-game-esq artificies but that the underlying game is in fact rather competative and ruthless.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

                            On a different slant than Jesse, but maybe along the same lines of differentiation...<br/><br/>There are a lot of games that are pretty hard-core about the mission completion. Things like Spycraft 2.0 and the like. In those games you've got a mission that your team has to beat, and they can be really hard to complete even if every player and PC is on the same page and working together as a well oiled machine. Putting in a differing agenda for even one PC can lead to brutality all around. If your Wheelman goes off to romance the love of his life while you're in the final stages of the game, you know what will happen exactly 20 minutes later? Total Party Kill. <br/><br/>Games that are totally kicker based, otoh, get their grove from the personal goals of the characters being the over-riding force of the game. I've seen some big explosive Sorcerer-style games where putting mission goals into the middle of character goals will kill the game just as dead. Sure Johnny is dealing with his possesed baby and is trying to figure out if he has to kill his wife or not, and Max is having an affair with Johnny's wife and wondering if he's going to have to kill the baby, and its getting really tense... but now we pause to go and fight the vampires who are taking over the Mayor's office. WTF? <br/><br/>The place I think I drift away from Jesse is that I think that it is possible to balance both types of goal in the same game, but you have to know what you're doing and have some degree of deliberatness in doing so. Spycraft does this by having "sub missions" in which it is specifically focused on someone having a personal plot/goal without compromising the group getting the main mission accomplished. <br/><br/>Games like FLFS do this by using the two goals to contrast and highlight each other, often using one to raise the stakes and tension of the other. In those situations you get the oft cited "If they'd all just work together and focus on the external mission, they'd be able to whump the Klingons no problem!" vs "If they'd just focus on their own problems and forget the Klingons they'd all have healthy marriages in no time!" -- with both objectives usually being used to presurize a situation that would otherwise be uninteresting. And that's where you need some context to make it flow -- because if you're supposed to be trying to complete both, you need to know that, and if you're supposed to chose one and let the other go in a high moral choice, you need to know that too.<br/><br/>It isn't that having both is bad news so much as having both without a social contract and/or system that lets you know how you are going to balance them is bad news.                        </div>

                            Brand, I actually think we're total agreement.  Character vs Scenario is just a really bad choice of words for the principle as a whole.  I choose those words specific to the original conversation from which Josh pulled the original quote.  I think having individual character goals and group level situation goals are perfectly compatable as long as the camera angles I talked about originally are the same for each.<br/><br/>The thematic tension between a personal goal and the goals of my military unit is awesome.<br/><br/>The competative goal of can I achieve this personal goal without dropping the ball for my team is also awesome.<br/><br/>Trying to make a point about your characters loyalty by abandoning the team to save your character's wife and then getting hammered (socially, by the real players) for droping the ball is pretty much the definition of disfunction.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

                            So objectives are more "we, as a group, have agreed that this is our collective goal in play" whereas character goals are individual methods to fulfill the collective goal of something like "a good story?"                        </div>

                            So here's the question that's become interesting to me: how does the group come to agree on their collective goal(s)?<br/><br/>Were I to create an objective-based game (like, say, a high-action American Revolution game), how might I structure the rules for the selection and ratification of these objectives?<br/><br/>Immediately coming to mind:<br/>a) the GM (Tory Player) creates all objectives by fiat<br/>b) the other players (Patriot Players) each flag one objective on their sheet, and these are synthesized by the Tory Player<br/>c) randomly selecting generic objectives (rescue captured spy from British ship)<br/>d) randomly generating objectives, mad-lib style ( ___[verb]____ _____[NPC]_____ in/at/from ____[location]____)<br/><br/>I don't especially like (a), if only because it's been done a thousand times before and player buy-in is purely derived from the GM's ability to read player interests, often psychically.  I've explored (b) a bit with <em>FLFS</em> situation creation, so I'd like to let that fester on its own before revisiting it.  I believe <em>Grey Ranks</em> is using something like (c), so I should pester Jason for the latest version to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">rip off</span> consider what he's got done.  Alternately, (d) is somewhat like the character generation that I've already got, so that's got points for it already.  I just don't know how crazy those objectives might turn out being (Assassinate George Washington in Paris, France).<br/><br/>What other methods have been explored already, or what's not yet been tried?                        </div>

                            When you play a D&amp;D module, there's a mission/scenario objective that's independent of the characters' personalities; as Jesse said, "retrieve this," or more often, "kill that."  It is then expected that the players and GM either align character goals with the objective ("I guess my character would go on this mission to gain money/win fame/impress the prince/avenge her mentor") or don't care about character goals at all and just go as play pieces.  And yeah, usually an objective is given to the whole party together.<br/><br/>Character goals, on the other hand, are personal to the character.  I think they can very well be independent of "good story" if the character's goals are killing things and gaining wealth, or becoming the most powerful wizard in the land, or whatnot.  They can be challenge-based goals instead of story-based goals, motivated by the player's interest in encountering and defeating the most difficult challenges in the game.<br/><br/>At least that's the perspective that makes the distinction most useful for me.                        </div>

                            Well, this is getting muddled by the context of the original discussion.  In the original discussion the poster was expressing disappointment and discomfort with the lack of individual characters not having goals.  My immediate thought was, "Well, we're talking about World's Largest Dungeon here so doesn't the scenario itself provide goals."  It's since been clearified in the original thread that it does in fact provide one: Get out alive.<br/><br/>So originally I was thinking about the SOURCE of a character goal.  One source is the character itself another source is the situation at hand.  So, the source of a character goal is Creative Agenda neutral.  It's just a technique.  For that matter group vs. individual goals is a creative agenda netural technique is well.  Having character goals at all is just a technique as I could imagine a party scenario in which characters were just "being themselves."<br/><br/>Anyway, when you brought the spotlight in on my distinction and I thought about it some more I realized something else.  In addition to just talking about the source of character motivation I was also making unthinking intuitive leap across Creative Agenda borders.  In my first post I basically tried to illuminate this and how it had unconsciously colored my thinking in the original thread.  Brand's post brings to light why this was probably a mistake.<br/><br/>I realize now that the source of character movtivation and creative agenda are very tightly linked in my own personal brain.  So when someone says, "Character Goals" I immediately begin thinking down Story Now lines.  I start thinking about deeply personal motives that what those motives say about a character and what means is that character willing to use to get them?  How will he react to failure?  What events could stray him from those motivations?<br/><br/>On the other hand when I think of an external source of motivation being FED to a character (i.e. Scenario Goal) I almost immediately go into a Step On Up mode of thinking.  What are the obstacles between me and my objective?  What role do I play in my team?  What resources are at my disposal and how do I get more of them.  And so on.<br/><br/>So way back in the original thread when the original poster expressed concern for the lack of character goals plus the desire to play Worlds Largest Dungeon I saw a CA clash waiting to happen.  In this thread Brand pointed out that this may not neccessarily be the case.  This was also at the heart of my entire day spent in frustation at Lacuna as I tried to reconcile the surface idea of "You are a team of agents sent out to dispose of a hostile personality" with certain design elements of the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Well that certainly made things clearer for me.  I have no idea if it helps you at all. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

                            Nah, this is good stuff, Jesse.  And as Christian points out, as it's often assumed that players will be retroactively engaging their characters with whole-group or situation-based objectives, I think it's even clearer how such objectives can play out in a Story Now or even Right to Dream setting.                        </div>

                            I also think one of the big issues in the mixup is around the idea of the group, party, or team. <br/><br/>I mean it's one of the most common player formations in RPGs right? That they're all a unit that works together for... something, at least most of the time. And yet we also get told that each individual PC should have goals and motivations of their own. <br/><br/>And as soon as you've got the "there is no I in team" on one side and the "There is no team in my wedding bed" on the other, you've got some issues you need to address.<br/><br/>I know that since I've abandoned the assumption that every PC in any given game will be even vaugly on the same side, much less in the same unit, all sorts of possibilities for play have exploded across my vision.                        </div>
