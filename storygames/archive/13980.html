And as part of that process, Ive been thinking about different types of conflict, and if there are some types of 'conflict' you just dont want to be bothered treating as a conflict at all.<br/><br/>So I made a list of types of conflict. and I came up with fightin and talkin.  And then I maybe 'challenging situations' as a third type.<br/><br/>Is that it, does it all come down to fightin and talkin and maybe a few challenging situations?  My personal definition of a challenging situation is something that dosent involve fightin or talkin, but is a task that is being performed under pressure.  Like defusing a bomb, or competing in some kind of contest.  <br/><br/>Does all <i>interesting</i> conflict basically involve being in opposition to another character?  Like maybe the bomb defuser vs the bomb maker?  Or the other competitor in the archery contest, etc...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316767/#Comment_316767" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T23:24:03+00:00" title="March 15, 2011 11:24PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also man vs. God - surviving a tornado or cancer.<br/><br/>There's also man vs. himself - overcoming a temptation or a bad habit.<br/><br/>But yeah, most RPGs focus on man vs. man.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316770/#Comment_316770" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T00:47:46+00:00" title="March 16, 2011 12:47AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Im not expressing myself well.   Surviving cancer or a tornado wouldnt be an interesting conflict - like "roll a dice - yay, you live / oh, you die!"<br/><br/>And I dont see man vs. self as interesting either.  OK, maybe it is interesting, but not something you would roll for.  It would be even more interesting to have the player decide under what circumstances the character wins or looses vs himself than have it decided randomly.<br/><br/>So Im thinking the only things worth rolling for are fighting, talking and contesting.  Where contesting means a challenging situation for the character that can be represented in some way as a contest with another character, even if the character isnt actively present at the time.  Like the bomb maker vs the bomb defuser.<br/><br/>Can you think of an interesting conflict that isnt fighting, talking or contesting?

Sticking narration to the resources you used, it makes interesting to see "how" you managed to survive or failed trying.<br/>Maybe you survived the tornado, but you sacrificed all your camping material for that, which adds a lot to the future scenes... I think that interesting conflicts are those who actually add something that change the story in a way that results clear to the players. It's the way they get in the story that makes them interesting.<br/>So, can you make a brief example of a conflict for your game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316796/#Comment_316796" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T08:58:00+00:00" title="March 16, 2011  8:58AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about societal conflicts.

I like the <i>situation </i>, but I think the others are implying in that situation, the conflict is about if Spidey stops for the crime, or not.  And lets roll a dice to determine if he does.   You are talking about the player resolving the characters internal struggle with a decision (which I agree with) and letting the dice decide the consequences of the man vs himself conflict.  Thats fortune in the middle, right?  (not too sure on forge terminology)  <br/><br/>This isnt really relevent, but with Ingenero, that would play out differently.  Spidey would have one or more goals which the player sets before the challenge - maybe stopping the crime, maybe keeping MJ happy, maybe both.  then the bastard GM would try to engineer a dilemma that forces the player had to choose which goal was more important -- lets say teh choice is crime.  The consequences would be that MJ is let down, and then the Spidey rolls to see if he can stop the crime.  If he does, he gets points for achieving a goal.  He may have decided to abandon the goal and go to MJ.

But even if you don't, I think you can have equally valid and playable models.<br/><br/>In BW you set up the conflicts you're interested in following a pretty loose formula with lots of "best practices" to help. The mechanic pays you to build in internal conflicts -- man vs. self in the above scheme -- and that does a great job of prompting players to take up conflicted, even self-destructive, storylines for their characters. Best practices goes beyond the actual mechanics and prompts players to agree to a "situation" about which everyone agrees they will create a conflict (a Belief that needs to be resolved), but that "situation" might be a problem created by another intelligent entity (a corrupt summoner has taken the land by force and placed himself as Emperor) or by something entirely natural (the past generation has seen massive flooding, and what was once a unified nation is now broken up into island-nations).<br/><br/>What's the game that explicitly specifies that the only mechanized conflicts are those between intelligent agents? Is it an Edwards thing? I feel so dumb. But that's also totally legit; it just makes for a different game.<br/><br/>Then there's Heroquest, I think maybe (?), that maps "intelligence" onto natural phenomena that oppose the wishes of characters. The storm "wants" to keep your ship from reaching shore. The cliff "wants" to keep you from climbing it. It's abstract and interesting and is probably a smart way to standardize all conflict.<br/><br/>I think the folks who can't wrap their heads around internal conflicts being a) interesting and/or b) mechanized probably can't buy into the idea of playing as the character's author, rather than as the character. I've still got a couple ex-players with whom I am still friends who shake their heads at the idea of any game that can "make" (?) "you" (???) change your mind about something through a die roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316953/#Comment_316953" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T12:51:47+00:00" title="March 17, 2011 12:51PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Man vs himself is definitely interesting, but you wouldnt make it a<b>randomly</b>decided conflict, would you?</blockquote>\nFor some games, it can be a good choice.<br/><br/>Most good solutions I've seen to this kind of situation, however, deal more with costs and consequences than the choice itself. The mechanics serve to set up consequences and challenges (in the Spiderman example, the mechanics would serve its role by making sure it was impossible or really unlikely for Spiderman to BOTH stop the crime and impress Mary Jane).<br/><br/>It can be as simple as differing incentives:<br/><br/>In The Shadow of Yesterday, Keys often have opposing rewards at different levels, with the Buyoff being the prime example: "You can get 3 XPs right now for helping the Princess, or you can get 10 XPs if you betray her. Which do you choose?"<br/><br/>That said, I think a lot of people do play PTA with stakes like, "Can he bring himself to forgive her?" (And I hope we'll hear more from them in this thread.) In other games where Beliefs or goals are on the line, you can make the game do it for you by saying, "My goal/challenge is to overcome my fear of spiders," even if that's not what the game normally does.<br/><br/>If I can play a game where I try to maneuver and improve my character's chances of defeating a bad guy, why not a game where I can maneuver to improve my character's chances of finally telling the truth to his loved ones? I think that could be a totally gripping game, in much the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316958/#Comment_316958" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T13:30:51+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  1:30PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fighting and talking are conflicts because they inherently are - they involve opposing wills.<br/><br/>man v nature etc.. are tasks (unless you anthropomorphise nature)<br/><br/>I think as long as the <b>task</b> is being performed under pressure, then it can be classified as an interesting conflict.

Your OP pondered whether other types of conflict existed, and then people responded with other types of conflict. Some were conflicts in the classic literary sense (man vs. nature, man vs. self) and others were more tailored to your particular inquiry. And you've roundly rejected a lot of them for rather immaterial reasons... most frequently that you don't think that they'd be exciting if reduced to a succeed/fail die roll.<br/><br/>This is a weird stance to be taking, given your intitial inquiry.<br/><br/>1.) Reducing any type of conflict to a flat succeed/fail die roll is sub-optimal game design. Games that do this without leveraging resource management or hard choices or skill dependency generally suck. If you aren't in immediate agreement with that statement, we can spin it into its own thread.<br/><br/>2.) The fact that something doesn't make for an interesting succeed/fail die roll doesn't mean that it makes for an uninteresting conflict. Some conflicts aren't about success or failure, but rather about how much stress you accumulate, what you do with your resources, or what something is worth to you. In fact, good conflict is rarely about success and failure, just as suspense is rarely about finding out whether or not something happens. If you aren't in immediate agreement with that statement, I'd love to link a few articles (especially one of Vincent Baker's, about suspense).<br/><br/>3.) Stepping away from points 1 and 2, many of the conflicts you've dismissed actually ARE interesting if reduced to a succeed/fail die roll, in comparison to the other types of conflict that you're choosing to accept. "Let's roll to see if you survive the harsh climate and man-eating plants of the Rag Waste" is at least as good an idea as "Let's roll to see if you defeat the village guards." In fact, I find the Rag Wastes conflict more interesting, because it focuses in more intimately on the protagonist's struggle, rather than pitting A (the protagonist) and B (the guards) against one another to compare values.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316975/#Comment_316975" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T14:46:42+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  2:46PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2011 2:48PM by Stephen P.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EDIT: Cross-posted x2. Joe speaks the truth.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Frankly, I think that your preoccupation with "types of conflict" isn't doing too much work here. Really, the classifications of pressure are much more useful. Look at it this way: what you are really asking is, "What makes me, as an audience member, care about what's happening in the fiction?" (That's what I interpret you saying when you keep mentioning but not defining 'interesting.') What you are trying to do is find ways to "make" the audience care; of course you can't actually generate concern from scratch, but there are certain techniques to amplify it.<br/><br/>The type of pressure, then, is much more important than the type of conflict. Consider:<br/>1) I'm trying to fight off a horde of mutant-beasts long enough for the shuttle to escape! (Pressures: I'm out-numbered and physically out-matched, there is a time constraint, I am risking harm to my life, the people in the shuttle are counting on me, etc.)<br/><br/>2) I'm trying to talk the angry mob out of burning down the decrepit mansion where my deformed "monster" friends live. (Pressures: I'm outnumbered and physically/socially outmatched, there is a time constraint, I am risking harm to myself by standing in the way of the mob, my friends in the mansion are counting on me, etc.)<br/><br/>3) I'm trying to bake 100 cupcakes with just the materials on hand in order to win the high-profile cupcake competition tomorrow over the three head cooks and my hated rivals from the Mega Cupcake Emporium, Inc. (Pressures: I'm out-numbered and materially out-matched, there is a time constraint, I am risking harm to my reputation by challenging my rivals in an extremely public arena, my fans/supporters/investors/backers are counting on me, etc.)<br/><br/>4) I'm trying to beat my cocaine addiction before the end of the summer so that I can get a job and stable housing before the deadline when the court will take away my daughter forever. (Pressures: I'm out-matched psychically, there is a time constraint, I am risking permanent deterioration of my relationship with my daughter, my daughter-- and myself!-- are counting on me, etc.)<br/><br/>5) My boat has been wreaked and I'm trying to keep my head above water until help arrives. (Pressures: I am grossly out-matched in strength and stamina, there is a time constraint, I am risking death, I and all of my dependents are counting on me to survive, etc.).<br/><br/>I don't think I need to go on-- you get the idea. If you are looking for 'interesting,' then looking at the <i>type</i> of conflict is a red herring. The pressures involved plus what the character is risking (i.e. what is at stake) are what really matter. The tasks in each of those conflicts are wildly different, but the elements of pressure and risk make (read: help make) the audience care-- i.e., they make the drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316985/#Comment_316985" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T16:00:03+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  4:00PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2011 4:01PM by stefoid.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Stephen P</cite>EDIT: Cross-posted x2.

(Pressures: I am grossly out-matched in strength and stamina, there is a time constraint, I am risking death, I and all of my dependents are counting on me to survive, etc.).<br/><br/>I don't think I need to go on-- you get the idea. If you are looking for 'interesting,' then looking at the<i>type</i>of conflict is a red herring. The pressures involved plus what the character is risking (i.e. what is at stake) are what really matter. The tasks in each of those conflicts are wildly different, but the elements of pressure and risk make (read: help make) the audience care-- i.e., they make the drama.</blockquote>\nI think we are already in agreement, given my last post.  <br/><br/>The point to classification is that it helps recognition.  GMing is hard, and if you have a few rules of thumb or best practices in the back of your mind, you can use the useful human skill of pattern recognition to come up with an approach for the situation -- as long as there arent too many patterns and solutions to remember.  sure theres always going to be exceptions and whatnot, but if you can cover the larger percentage of situations with a few general approaches, then its helpful.<br/><br/>As for classification of types of conflict over context of conflict. (pressure)  well, some <i>types </i>of conflict occur much more frequently than others, and in the case of talking and fighting, they are conflicts where you are opposed to other characters, so to some degree they are inherently interesting/dramatic.   So I dont mind separating those out.  The context of the talking and fighting is also important, but because they are opposed conflicts, I would say less important than 'tasky' conflicts where the context is critical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316990/#Comment_316990" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T16:13:42+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  4:13PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>So, I think Im happy saying that there are four types of conflict - fighting, talking, contesting and performing under pressure.</blockquote>\nStefoid, it seems like you're really apprehensive about expanding your definition of conflict. Your OP pondered whether other types of conflict existed, and then people responded with other types of conflict. Some were conflicts in the classic literary sense (man vs. nature, man vs. self) and others were more tailored to your particular inquiry. And you've roundly rejected a lot of them for rather immaterial reasons... most frequently that you don't think that they'd be exciting if reduced to a succeed/fail die roll.<br/><br/>This is a weird stance to be taking, given your intitial inquiry.<br/><br/>1.) Reducing any type of conflict to a flat succeed/fail die roll is sub-optimal game design. Games that do this without leveraging resource management or hard choices or skill dependency generally suck. If you aren't in immediate agreement with that statement, we can spin it into its own thread.<br/><br/>2.) The fact that something doesn't make for an interesting succeed/fail die roll doesn't mean that it makes for an uninteresting conflict. Some conflicts aren't about success or failure, but rather about how much stress you accumulate, what you do with your resources, or what something is worth to you. In fact, good conflict is rarely about success and failure, just as suspense is rarely about finding out whether or not something happens. If you aren't in immediate agreement with that statement, I'd love to link a few articles (especially one of Vincent Baker's, about suspense).<br/><br/>3.) Stepping away from points 1 and 2, many of the conflicts you've dismissed actually ARE interesting if reduced to a succeed/fail die roll, in comparison to the other types of conflict that you're choosing to accept. "Let's roll to see if you survive the harsh climate and man-eating plants of the Rag Waste" is at least as good an idea as "Let's roll to see if you defeat the village guards." In fact, I find the Rag Wastes conflict more interesting, because it focuses in more intimately on the protagonist's struggle, rather than pitting A (the protagonist) and B (the guards) against one another to compare values.<br/><br/>no not apprehensive -- just trying to keep the amount of classification manageable.  Classifying something into 1000 categories isnt helpful.<br/><br/>1) ultimately things in RPGs do come down to a die roll.  Choosing what to make the die roll about and when to make it is the hard thing I am trying to clarify. (for my game).  I have concepts in my head - but I need to be able to make those concepts understandable on paper as clearly and concisely as possible.  Maybe I cant do that -- then paragraphs of hand wavy advice is the fallback option.<br/><br/>2) My whole game is about trying to engineer dramatic contexts for conflict, but please link those articles anyway.<br/><br/>3) Im not sure what are the many conflicts Ive dismissed that you are referring to?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316992/#Comment_316992" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T16:29:43+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  4:29PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>2) My whole game is about trying to engineer dramatic contexts for conflict, but please link those articles anyway.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow">Roleplaying Theory, Hardcore</a> by Vincent Baker.

This and playing out a nature conflict in Mouse Guard, say, as a forest fire with an agenda can be very rewarding and fun for me. I think the key is to play the opposing side of the conflict as a character, even if it's not a sentient or rational thing.

Joe speaks the truth.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Frankly, I think that your preoccupation with "types of conflict" isn't doing too much work here. Really, the classifications of pressure are much more useful. Look at it this way: what you are really asking is, "What makes me, as an audience member, care about what's happening in the fiction?" (That's what I interpret you saying when you keep mentioning but not defining 'interesting.') What you are trying to do is find ways to "make" the audience care; of course you can't actually generate concern from scratch, but there are certain techniques to amplify it.<br/><br/>The type of pressure, then, is much more important than the type of conflict. Consider:<br/>1) I'm trying to fight off a horde of mutant-beasts long enough for the shuttle to escape! (Pressures: I'm out-numbered and physically out-matched, there is a time constraint, I am risking harm to my life, the people in the shuttle are counting on me, etc.)<br/><br/>2) I'm trying to talk the angry mob out of burning down the decrepit mansion where my deformed "monster" friends live. (Pressures: I'm outnumbered and physically/socially outmatched, there is a time constraint, I am risking harm to myself by standing in the way of the mob, my friends in the mansion are counting on me, etc.)<br/><br/>3) I'm trying to bake 100 cupcakes with just the materials on hand in order to win the high-profile cupcake competition tomorrow over the three head cooks and my hated rivals from the Mega Cupcake Emporium, Inc. (Pressures: I'm out-numbered and materially out-matched, there is a time constraint, I am risking harm to my reputation by challenging my rivals in an extremely public arena, my fans/supporters/investors/backers are counting on me, etc.)<br/><br/>4) I'm trying to beat my cocaine addiction before the end of the summer so that I can get a job and stable housing before the deadline when the court will take away my daughter forever. (Pressures: I'm out-matched psychically, there is a time constraint, I am risking permanent deterioration of my relationship with my daughter, my daughter-- and myself!-- are counting on me, etc.)<br/><br/>5) My boat has been wreaked and I'm trying to keep my head above water until help arrives. (Pressures: I am grossly out-matched in strength and stamina, there is a time constraint, I am risking death, I and all of my dependents are counting on me to survive, etc.).<br/><br/>I don't think I need to go on-- you get the idea. If you are looking for 'interesting,' then looking at the<i>type</i>of conflict is a red herring. The pressures involved plus what the character is risking (i.e. what is at stake) are what really matter. The tasks in each of those conflicts are wildly different, but the elements of pressure and risk make (read: help make) the audience care-- i.e., they make the drama.</blockquote>\nThank you for this post, Stephen. This is exactly what I struggle with as a GM - how to build up a sense of pressure in my players so that they are more engaged. This post is helping me think about it. Those examples are great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317544/#Comment_317544" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T03:36:42+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  3:36AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>OK, Im still thinking about Ingenero specifically, but I have another sort of question(s) to ask which I can probably already guess your answers to, but:<br/><br/><i>Does all types interesting conflict have to involve rolling dice?</i><br/><i><br/>If no, do you think that certain types of conflict are better suited to involving dice rolling and other types are better suited to not involve dice?</i><br/><br/>Now obviously the answer to most of these types of queries is 'it depends' - it depends on the game, there is no true universal rule, yada yada...  However, what I am after is your generalizations.  Theres no right answer, I wont even agree/disagree, I promise, Im just after your thoughts.</blockquote>\nNow this is a very interesting question <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I think that talking about "dice" is a bit misleading. Interesting means that there is uncertainty - we want to find out how things will turn out because we currently do not know. How the uncertainty and "find out" is determined is not all that interesting. But (important bit) the amount of uncertainty should be comprehensible to the player.<br/><br/>An example, I am playing Thud the barbarian, i am being faced by an ork. As a player I know I am good at fighting because I have Excellent skill/stat/equipment. The uncertainty is - is the ork better or worse than Thud? The player will then ask questions about the ork - is he wearing armor, does it look stronger than me, is it faster or slower than me etc etc. You might get a couple of rounds of interest with determining how risky it is to fight, but eventually you want enough information to know "I will win" or "I will loose". If you make it certain then it is no longer interesting, just narrate and continue to next challenge.<br/><br/>Its all about what am I risking. If I am risking that Thud will die and the game is over, I want to be really really certain about the fight - to the point of, I dont want to make that particular bet with my character life So I want to run away, but if the risk i I might get hurt a bit to hurt badly, but I will win and continue the game I would be happy to make that bet. If there is no real risk of even being hurt, then why the heck are we even rolling?<br/><br/>But using cards, dice, etc is not so important, as long as I can gauge how risky a particular conflict is, and i KNOW what is at stake for me here as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Theres

There is a 50% chance of dying, but I save the princess if I get through.<br/><br/>Thats a bad scenario for me. I want to know how can i reduce that 50% so that I dont die. I want to know ways of reducing the chance of dying. If there isn't any way and the game hinges on a coin toss (literally, I will die and game over for me) then I will say - screw you princess, you can rit in there, I'm going over somewhere else.<br/><br/>good scenario would be - there is an expensive resurection scroll... so the trap is now a 50% chance of loosing 500gp. I am much happier with that choice because the risk to the player is reduced. I am now certain that I will survive, but I have reduced the risk to just be about gold. Or another option would be I can cover the princess in special material worth 100gold, but she then has a 75% chance of dieing. Again, its a higher risk of failure, but the risk to me is only 100gold and a king angry at me for killing his daughter.<br/><br/>I might actually prefer the last one as it leads to an interesting new story.<br/><br/>basically, the more interesting (to me the player) the failure option is, the less I care if I win or loose. The less interesting/more painful the failure option is, the more I want to be able to do to make the chance of failure as close to 0.<br/><br/>This is why "save or die" is such a sucky mechanic for any game.<br/><br/>its also possibly why Apocalypse World and similar games have become popular. ALL the risk is in the players hands, they get to heavily influence what they are risking, and more importantly, all the failures are interesting and lead to plot twists. You are at 0 risk of dying UNLESS YOU __CHOOSE__ TO MAKE THAT RISK.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317552/#Comment_317552" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T05:56:32+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  5:56AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that in man vs self, most often the consequences are what matter but this type of conflict can be played randomly rather than just relying on the player/character choice. <br/><br/>Can an addict resist using drugs just one more time?<br/>Can a wife resist not cheating on her husband?

I am playing a "tony stark" character. I need to make a self control check to see if I get totally wasted at a party and make a fool of myself, in front of start industry investors even...<br/><br/>Now to me as a player, I am happy to loose that. My character is about "having trouble with alcohol", so i WANT to see problems happen to me because of that.<br/><br/>But I am IRON MAN. I never even want to see a conflict that pits IRON MAN vs street punk with a shotgun. If the GM keeps making me run into street punk with shotgun holding up a shop its booooring. Always winning is boooring.<br/><br/>If you present there is a "uranium man" running around that is tougher than you and I know he would wipe the floor with me, the contest changes. I am NOT going to risk a standup fight where I have a 75% chance of dying and ending the game. I will be trying other thigns (which will be win/loose etc) trying to get information about uranium man, trying various things to weaken him, or find the special gun that is his weakness. The story becomes about all sorts of challenges in which it will be interesting to see if I win or loose until we get to the final scene where I have worked out all the weak spots of uranium man, made super weapons for iron man etc, and we get to the conclusion of the story where i know i will eventually NOT DIE, but where I have a chance of killing uranium man, or making him fly away to come back another day.<br/><br/>its not "ALWAYS WIN", it is "there is always a way to win, what will you sacrifice to win, or how much effort and cost will you expend to win".<br/><br/>The fun is not the _winning_, its in the path you take to get there, and what failures you encounter along the way.<br/><br/>If I am playing the "zero to hero" farmboy destined to be the kung-fu master. I want to become a kung-fu master eventually, thats the game I'm interested in playing - becoming a kung-fu master. The fact that I will live and become the best kung-fu fighter ever is inevitable. The question of randomness and danger should be what I have to give up, what trials do I need to get through to become there.<br/><br/>Will farmboy become the champion of the people, full of goodness and light? or will he leave a trail of dead bodies and crying children and desolation in his wake to becoming the terror of the nation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317591/#Comment_317591" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T11:29:07+00:00" title="March 23, 2011 11:29AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2011 11:30AM by Todd_L.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get where you're coming from, D.<br/>But I also think your princess example falls well-within<br/>the criticism at the ptgptb link.<br/><br/>(And the criticism implicit in the infamous 'dlckwolves' cartoon,<br/>for that matter.)<br/><br/>My perspective is-- that's fine.

This means the GM framing 'preliminary conflicts' -- those on the path to the goal conflict, but not the goal conflict itself -- such that what is resolved is not whether the character progresses but how (at what cost).  Progression is assumed.<br/><br/>I was thinking of firming that up with a little mechanical backing that makes it more explicit instead of dumping the entire responsibility onto the GM.<br/><br/> i.e. to use an example from my doco: lets say a pirate wants to board the enemy ship and his goal is to kill the enemy captain.  On the path to that goal, he has to board the ship and fight through the melee to first reach the captain.  boarding the ship and fighting through the melee is a preliminary conflict -- a hurdle.  Its would be inherently undramatic for the player to fail the scene there without a climactic battle to determine if he could achieve his goal.  A movie would never script the scene with the hero falling at the first hurdle, unless it was for comic effect.<br/><br/>So rather than the GM frame the scene as a what, you could assume success and frame it as a how - the character would be making a play such as "I battle through the melee with my pistol in one hand and my cutlass in the other, on order to reach the enemy captain".   then what is resolved is - what does it cost you to do that?    The mechanic says that a succeed roll means it costs nothing, while the magnitude of the failed roll results a proportionate disadvantage going into the next contest.  i.e. you loose 4 to 7 means you get a -3 during the contest after the hurdle, which diminishes your chance of achieving your eventual goal.<br/><br/>In fact, you could leave the GM off the hook totally and leave it to the player to decide how the conflict is framed.  If the player decides to spend some resources, they have the power to demand that a scene be framed as a 'how it happens' instead of a 'what happens'.<br/><br/>so the equation for the player is :<br/><br/>How badly do I want to pass this hurdle?  By spending resources I can change the equation from a what happens to a how it happens.<br/><br/>and then for the test itself, the player can risk resources to increase their chance at passing the hurdle without negative consequences.<br/><br/>Would that appeal?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13980/theres-only-three-types-of-intetresting-conflict" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13980/theres-only-three-types-of-intetresting-conflict" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13980/theres-only-three-types-of-intetresting-conflict/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13980%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13980%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
