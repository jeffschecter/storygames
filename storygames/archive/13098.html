That was all long ago, when lives were larger, before things were settled. Now, if there is any greatness left, it is great evil, evil that will change the world for the worse. In the last hour of that age, a new story begins. Will it be the story of a hero, rising up to save what is good and true about the old age to shepherd it into the new, or will it be a sad lament for things long gone to usher in a new age of darkness? It is now the final hour of a storied age, and telling the story falls to you.<br/><br/><i>Storied Age</i> is a no-prep GM-less story game that, over a few sessions of play, creates an epic fantasy story in the vein of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, or <i>The Sword of Truth</i>. The game weaves together the creative contributions of each individual player in a structured plot arc and then helps you play through a chapter-by-chapter account of how your characters face adversity, similar to the way an author starts with an outline and fleshes it out into a full novel. By breaking up the creative responsibility and providing creative constraints to guide players\u2019 contributions, <i>Final Hour of a Storied Age</i> lets everyone experience an epic fantasy story without asking anyone to shoulder an epic creative burden.</blockquote>\nI recently released a new playtest draft of the game that I'm eager to put to the test. I'm primarily interested in finding alpha playtesters who are willing to play with me over Skype. I wouldn't turn away feedback from people who wanted to play with their own groups (especially if they could record the session), but I'm not confident that the game is ready for full beta testing yet. I'd also love to get feedback from people who might be interested in the game but can't commit to playtesting -- <a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=303&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">this Praxis thread</a> is a great place for that. Although they're based on earlier versions of the game, you can get a feel for how it plays by listening to some recent episodes of my AP podcast <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast" rel="nofollow">Designer vs. Reality</a> or by reading these <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2010/06/17/final-hour-of-a-storied-age-playtest-6a/" rel="nofollow">playtest</a> <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2010/06/21/final-hour-of-a-storied-age-playtest-6b/" rel="nofollow">reports</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296074/#Comment_296074" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-06T11:27:19+00:00" title="October  6, 2010 11:27AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just posted the latest revision of the rules: <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Storied-Age-RPG-rev066.pdf" rel="nofollow">Final Hour of a Storied Age rev 0.66</a>. If anyone's on the fence about giving me feedback or volunteering to playtest, let me know if there's anything I can do to convince you to help me.

My playtests with Dan have had their problems, but that I think has had more to do with communicating intent than game mechanics. It's worth a shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
