We used my pre-SG-era freeform gaming system, which was basically "Player states intention, roll, GM describes."  But even with the R-mapping and collective setting design, the game felt flat.<br/><br/>So Tuesday night I suggested we write each PC's name on the Owe List 3 times each, use the setup we did as the baseline, and pick up right where we left off with those characters.  The game brought the sauce, the session was great, and before we knew it we were like "Hey, it's 4 hours later.  Crap!  I have to work tomorrow."<br/><br/>Observations:   \n<ul><li>Best interests that name another character is a great way to get the PCs to have friction, even if we go in with PCs all working together.</li><li>I could play my NPCs passionately and didn't have to hold back on anything.</li><li>I found a new thing Oracles do for the game.</li><li>You can prep some stuff in advance and use IAWA to do it right.</li><li>For our setup, a non-random Oracle worked great</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Since this session was primarily PCs vs the world, which IAWA doesn't typically do, most resolution was just one or two PCs rolling against one or two NPCs, with the DM or the player holding the stick, as it were.  It worked just as it would in a typical IAWA game, though, so there weren't any problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis" title="Morten Greis"><img alt="Morten Greis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis">Morten Greis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189689/#Comment_189689" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T01:12:11+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  1:12AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once shifted my campaign from the regular rules to IAWA and it worked great. <br/><br/>It was a Nephilim-campaign, and the Nephilim rules are devrived from Basic/Call of Cthulhu, just a lot more complicated and somewhat cumbersome, "Complicated Basic" might be the right name. So when we were at the great showdown with a huge climatic battle around the secret headquarters in London, I told the players, that we would use IAWA for the showdown (a single episode/chapter) and we converted their characters to IAWA, along with a bunch of NPC's, which was quickly done, and then we had the great showdown in a few hours. It was dramatic, it was cool and we accomplished a lot more, than the traditional style of "Declare action, roll dice, DM describes, repeat" allows for. <br/><br/>We didn't use oracles or we owe, as this was just a one-shot ep inside the regular campaign designed for handling a great and complicated conflict with a lot double interests and backstabbing during the showdown. It works, and it works great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189726/#Comment_189726" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T08:58:15+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  8:58AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!
