And its already made it's funding goal. Now let's get some cool stretch goals!<br/><br/><i>Simple Superheroes</i> is a framework that lets you create the rules that govern your characters and universe. It has been extensively playtested in campaign play and at conventions for 6 years.<br/><br/>While characters can have straightforward talents like <i>Might 4- punching [O]</i>, they can also have far more esoteric talents such as <i>Toughness 3- conviction [F]</i>.<br/><br/>Many players appreciate the <i>Strainpoint</i> and <i>Relation</i> mechanics, which tie your superhero into the game world and let them fight harder.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.enworld.org/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=68375&amp;d=1431703248"/><br/><br/>You can find out more at <a href="http://www.composedreamgames.com" rel="nofollow">www.ComposeDreamGames.com</a> and on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-khlTmyWYIfwfRFp_1pqWA/videos" rel="nofollow">youtube channel</a>.<br/><br/>And of course feel free to ask questions here, and I'll do my best to answer them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jKitz" title="jKitz"><img alt="jKitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/773/nPWM17RF2CNB5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jKitz">jKitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445506/#Comment_445506" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-04T02:06:31+00:00" title="June  4, 2015  2:06AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/737794315/simple-superheroes-rpg/posts/1252950" rel="nofollow">kickstarter for Simple Superheroes</a> is going very well. We've already met our first stretch goal! So I've been working on including the mini-scenario <i>Le Jardin du Ciel</i>. A daring robbery by the <i>Emerald Hawk</i> of a charity banquet at a posh skyscraper restaurant.<br/>This section also provides extensive guidance on designing your own scenario's and provides examples of how this scenario might run.<br/><br/>Our next stretch goal involves expanding our interior art. We've decide to go for simple and evocative black and white line art. I find this style fires the imagination.<br/>Using this style of black and white art also allows us to include more pieces, and makes it more printer friendly for individuals who may wish to print our pdf, or use it on an e-reader.<br/>Here is a few examples of our interior art.<br/><br/>Mindfire. <br/><img alt="image" src="http://memberfiles.freewebs.com/95/62/64956295/photos/Promo-Art/Mindfire%20fav-1.jpg"/><br/>Mindfire is the character used in our example of character creation in chapter 1 of Issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%230&amp;Mode=like">#0</a>. The fire effects he uses are primarily illusory, but he can also control real fire. He also has talents that let him stun and mesmerize opponents.<br/><br/>Mr Mercurial<br/><img alt="image" src="http://memberfiles.freewebs.com/95/62/64956295/photos/Promo-Art/mr%20mercurial-1.jpg"/><br/>Mr Mercurial is a brash, pompous speedster, created in one of the first playtests of Simple Superheroes at go-play Ottawa.<br/><br/>Despite our intentions to use entirely black and white interiors, it is fun to see what some of the pieces might look like in colour. Here is Templar in black and white, and in colour.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://memberfiles.freewebs.com/95/62/64956295/photos/Promo-Art/templar.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://memberfiles.freewebs.com/95/62/64956295/photos/Promo-Art/templarcolour-1.PNG"/><br/><br/>Templar is presented as both a starting character and a very experience and revered hero in Issue 0. He makes a good paragon figure, and moral compass for new heroes to look up too.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
