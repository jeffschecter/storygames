I think that's awesome, because I can listen to game design discussion until the speakers are blue in the face! Maybe that's not universal among RPG enthusiasts, though.<br/><br/>If you were attending the convention, what topic(s) would you like to hear designers discuss? Ideally it'd be a topic that's useful for those who play games, not just those who like to tinker with them, but it seems a waste to ignore the fact that the panelists are all accomplished designers as well as players.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229001/#Comment_229001" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T12:36:25+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 12:36PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 7:34AM by lachek.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Soooo.... RPG panels are dead, nobody gives a crap? Is that it?<br/><br/>Let's do this instead. What would you like to hear the following people talk on? Who'd you pair up with who to get a really interesting conversation going, one that's controversial and yet productive?<br/><br/>(yes, Anna and Darcy, I'm calling you out here - feel free to pipe up with subjects you'd like to talk on, if you're reading!)\n<ul>\n<li><b>Robin D. Laws</b> - The Dying Earth, GUMSHOE, HeroQuest, Feng Shui, Mutant City Blues, and more - plus a metric crapton of GM advice</li>\n<li><b>Darcy Burgess</b> - Black Cadillacs, Race</li>\n<li><b>Pieter van Hiel</b> - Usagi Yojimbo, Ironclaw, Jadeclaw</li>\n<li><b>Anna Kreider</b> - Thou Art But A Warrior, Black Sky (in playtest)</li>\n<li><b>Jonathan Lavallee</b> - CyberGeneration, Suitors (card game)</li>\n</ul>\nI'd personally be interested in knowing what these folk think of the role story / plot should play in RPGs to make them entertaining and effective... also, how they see mechanics being used in interesting ways, or not. I've also had suggestions on "GM troubleshooting" (i.e. "my home campaign has this problem, how do I solve it") and "gaming and new media" (i.e. gaming in the age of podcasts, forums, wikis etc).<br/><br/>Thoughts and ideas?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229003/#Comment_229003" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T12:45:20+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 12:45PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 12:47PM by Graham.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things I'd like to hear Robin Danger Laws talk on:<br/><br/>Hamlet<br/>Freelance writing<br/>Your GM troubleshooting thing<br/>The Dying Earth<br/>Indie games<br/>What sort of fish he would like to be, if he could be one.<br/><br/>Things I'd like to hear Anna Kreider talk on:<br/><br/>Pirate Jenny<br/>Why she is so awesome<br/><br/>I don't really know the others.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229112/#Comment_229112" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T19:08:46+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  7:08PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who is actually planning on going, I know robin laws, but I honestly haven't read any of his stuff as for the rest, I don't even know them at all. <br/><br/>So I would probably ask why are they so cool, and if they can tell me how to be cool?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
