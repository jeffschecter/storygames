When you roll to hinder someone you roll + your bond and then if you suceed it's -2. So it's nearly impossible if you're -4. Why would someone ever subtract from their bonds then?<br/><br/>Volley seems soft because it's easy for a character to carry 10+ uses of adventuring supplies and never have to worry about ammo. I have a player who always chooses to mark off ammo and it's never an issue. I suppose encumberance rules will fix that but it seems hard to call BS on too many adventuring supplies when they could represent so many different things.<br/><br/>Parley - Can a player always Parley to intimidate, scare, or hinder monsters? Seems kind of strong if Jim and his friend are facing off against 5 Orcs on Wolves and he parleys to scare them off. He has +3 charisma though so it's pretty easy.<br/><br/>Our characters seem to be hitting nearly 20XP a 3 hour session which seems really high. Is this intended? They blew by level 2 in a hurry.  Admittedly we had a long drawn out fight and someone marked the Fighter's dex which lead to him gaining 19xp during the session - that was probably a mistake highlighting that stat.<br/><br/>The Thief's Use Device ability seems crazy good. Does this mean a Thief can wear platemail and wield a huge weapon? Can he still sneak around and do thief things then? That seems way too good and is a no brainer for any thief to take. <br/><br/>We're still loving the game, we just hit a few little bumps like the above questions. Definitely looking to input on how to handle the above situations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318678/#Comment_318678" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T09:01:29+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  9:01AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2011 9:02AM by Teataine.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>*Why would anyone subtract from their bonds?</i><br/>Yeah this seems weird. I dunno, why would you, ever? Is there a part of the game that makes you subtract from your bonds? I don't remember.<br/><br/><i>*Ammo</i><br/>Remember that in AW (and DW) fictional context is very important. "So where are you keeping all those arrows?" is a perfectly legit DM question to ask, that lets you act on that info - you have the MC moves at your disposal: use up their resources, show a downside to their equipment. I'm not sure how one could carry 10+ uses of adventuring supplies, especially not at the beginning. That would cost 8+ gold just for the arrows.<br/><br/><i>*Parley</i><br/><i>To do it, do it.</i> "So you're trying to parley with this orc that's spitting blood in your face, with an axe inches from your neck? How does that look like, what are you saying to him?" Otherwise, yes, sure.<br/><br/><i>*Use device</i><br/>It says a thief can use those those items, not that they are magically light, small, silent or whatever. Again "So you're trying to sneak in there in full plate?" is a perfectly valid question to ask, and act upon in the fiction.<br/><br/>Not sure about XP, I guess that varies from group to group. Remember that they're going to need more and more xp with each level however, and there aren't many ways to gain it any faster. Getting to level 2 should be easy. Level 10 is going to last for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318686/#Comment_318686" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T09:52:26+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  9:52AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor nails it.<br/><br/>There are things that, in game, can increase and lower the bonds, but yeah, generally you want to get to know your fellow adventurer's better, not worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318690/#Comment_318690" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T10:01:11+00:00" title="April  4, 2011 10:01AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The whole XP thing is a non-issue.

It also makes monster balancing difficult from the GMs perspective when power changes that rapidly.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite><i>*Ammo</i><br/>Remember that in AW (and DW) fictional context is very important.

Right now the choice is easy and the only way I can place the archer in danger is by forcing the fiction which is lame considering the move is designed to guide the fiction in that direction but fails to do so because ammo is so easily obtainable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318745/#Comment_318745" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T15:21:49+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  3:21PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, at present knowing what someone can carry is a bit odd. We're adding rules for that, I think they manage to be simple and fun while also making a Thief, even one who can use plate, think twice about wearing it. Hell, even a Paladin who's just stumbled across a pile a loot will be thinking twice about dropping some armor, or not being able to take that extra sack of coins.<br/><br/>The gear list does top out very, very early. Part of that is just that the rules provide no idea of economy (when can you buy a castle?), and part of that is just the gear list being designed to get people started. It's getting some love in the latest round of revisions, and should be better.<br/><br/>Do you feel there was anything in particular that threw XP out of whack? There are a couple of known issues around some alignments where earning XP becomes a given, Adam and I are working on those, but in general fast XP doesn't worry us too much. We've also worked on damage, HP and damage a little to hopefully make them easier to use, and ease some problems from having a party level differential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318756/#Comment_318756" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T16:29:28+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  4:29PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            XP being thrown out of whack was partially alignment which you've made note of and partially a Fighter having Dex highlighted.

If you're an evil overlord, do you really care what happens to the monsters serving you? So you don't worry if the PCs plow through them, there's more around the next corner. And you, as the GM, should know that monsters are likely to be plowed through, and if they prove to be tough, running away is still interesting stuff. Lots of Defy Danger in running away, and then the PCs have a now-prepared monster to worry about. One of my favorite parts of the low complexity and fictional ties of DW is that, when something unexpected comes up, I can wing it. Players run away from the mad wizard? Well, he probably just cast some protective wards against them, I wonder what those do...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
