I want a specific game that does a bunch of stuff that a bunch of games that I like do. But no game does all the things that I want. Here's an example of what I want:<br/><br/>PRIMETIME ADVENTURES' scene framing<br/>IN A WICKED AGE's reoccurring characters and continuity rules<br/>BURNING EMPIRES' world/setting creation<br/>LACUNA's set task number<br/>DANGER PATROL's character options/focus<br/>NOBILIS' epic feel<br/>etc, etc, etc...<br/><br/>and superheroes.<br/><br/>There's some other games that I want to rip off and graft onto this monster as well, but I don't know if it's really going to work. I know that those individual mechanics work in their games, but I don't know if they'll gel with everything else. I don't mind sanding off the edges of the pieces to get stuff to fit and work, but is it really worth it, or should I just design from the ground up?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237294/#Comment_237294" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T18:45:36+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  6:45PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's nothing wrong with Frankenstein design.  <br/><br/>The key is to make sure those components actually hang together in a meaningful way.

All the problems are with the stuff I added or took away. Maybe you'll do better. Hell, maybe <i>I</i> will in the next rev ("...he said, with unjustified optimism.").<br/><br/>I think the trick is to carve your sources at the joints as much as possible, taking whole "modules" out as cleanly as possible. Identify the synergies, and the points of friction. Play to the combined strengths and the hidden strengths you've discovered in the sources, like the death spiral I found in Lady Blackbird and exploited in my work. And have a plan to minimize the effect of the friction or dike it out - as I did with all the recovery mechanics in all of my source games, which would bail players out of the death spiral I was taking advantage of. Then live up to your predecessors, which is the really hard part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
