That is, I expected this, for some reason, to be an easy answer. I imagined a paradigm of public design that I hadn't yet discovered. I was expecting a couple of links to the de facto solution.<br/><br/>I'm starting to infer that open (or public) design has its place outside of wikis and fancy tech. When people say they design publicly, does that mean they blog about their concepts but keep the game text in a private manuscript?<br/><br/>Can you point me to examples of public design and the tools these designers use?<br/>Can you give me a good reason to start a design blog?<br/>Can you give me a good reason not to start a design blog?<br/>Can you see any advantage in providing a developmental text in wiki format?<br/><br/>And, if you have time, what does designing in public mean, practically, to you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384535/#Comment_384535" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-07T20:54:05+00:00" title="July  7, 2012  8:54PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2012 8:55PM by Onix.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you point me to examples of public design and the tools these designers use?<br/><br/>Erm, I try to the best of my ability. I do have people that jump in every once in a while and give a few thoughts, but I don't have a legion of contributors. As far as tools, forums and Word Press<br/><br/>Can you give me a good reason to start a design blog?<br/><br/>Personally, when I started a blog for my games, at first I set a goal of posting something substantial every day. Sometimes it wasn't about design, but I didn't intend it to be a 100% design blog. What it did was really get me writing and improved my writing skills. I was free to throw out half baked ideas with some hand waving to get the idea across. That made the ideas easier to get down in writing and sketch them out. It also made me a better writer. After a while though, posting every day eats a lot of time and I had to go to posting once a week to actually write up my ideas formally.<br/><br/>Can you give me a good reason not to start a design blog?<br/><br/>It does take up more time to maintain. If you're looking for collaboration, you may not get the level you're expecting. (even with a wiki)<br/><br/>Can you see any advantage in providing a developmental text in wiki format?<br/><br/>For me it's been a bit of a hassle to use a wiki, I've gotten more involvement on neutral ground forums where the community was already established. I've then taken that content and put it into the wiki.<br/><br/>And, if you have time, what does designing in public mean, practically, to you?<br/><br/>I'm always cool with collaborations but there are really very few that will want to help out in a dedicated way. Or at least that's been my experience. I'm not a super charismatic guy so I'll happily take whatever I can get. That said, I have on occasion had someone help out with a project and have it become really awesome. For example <a href="http://www.thefreerpgblog.com/" rel="nofollow">Rob</a> <a href="http://www.icar.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Lang,</a> <a href="http://www.rpglaboratory.com/realms_of_lore/realms_of_lore_v3" rel="nofollow">JK Mosher,</a> and <a href="http://soundcloud.com/rpgambience" rel="nofollow">Joachim Heise</a>* have all helped me out with ideas, organization or in Joachim's case made a soundtrack for a game for me. It wasn't always what I was concentrating on. Rob kicks my butt and makes me do a better job every time I put something out there as a prototype. JK helped make some really cool hunting rules and encouraged me to branch out SPF to include some character ideas from the America's in SPF which I had been thinking of in a euro centric way.<br/><br/>*Had to give a little shout out to these guys because they're awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384539/#Comment_384539" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-07T22:07:31+00:00" title="July  7, 2012 10:07PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neko_Ewen does that with his Magical Burst RPG, he maintains a blog, posts a drafts, takes feedback, and creates a new draft.

It's less free labor (nobody will do your work for you) than people pointing out mistakes and omissions before you've gone too far to easily fix it. If you're worried about focus, start with that focus and usually the commentators will actually hold you to it when you start to stray. "Hey I thought this was a game about greek philosophers socially outmaneuvering each other to become the greatest philosopher of all time, not a game about Hades and Persephone." or something.\n<blockquote>I'd expect a designer to limit the blog posts to considered, honest and constrained topics and that the designer engage with topical commentary.</blockquote>Stay on topic, yes, but keep the topics varied especially if you're keeping to schedule of posting once a day or three times a week. Some days you'd rather write a short story about the setting than work on mechanics.

It started with posting the most recent drafts as "pages" on my Wordpress blog, discussing where I was with them in blog posts, and talking about major updates to the text when I actually got around to making them. For me, this was less about getting feedback on my work and more about developing my own design voice, sharing what I was doing with others, and making sure design projects were available for other people to play and build on even if they ultimately ended up being abandoned or left unfinished (the fate of 99% of design projects). <br/><br/>In general, I've found that the response to posted game drafts lags by at least 6 months and often as much as a year or more, as people find out about them, become interested in them (often due to me running them at meetups, but sometimes independently), and start playing them or talking about them. That's been the story with both Geiger Counter and Metrofinal, the latter of which is just now seeing semi-regular play, though the current beta draft was posted in November 2011. Consequently, IME, open design is pretty terrible if what you want is immediate feedback and collaboration, because it inevitably happens on people's own schedules. That said, if what you have in mind is a slow-burn long-term development process that will take you at least a couple years, it can be great. Knock out a working draft, post it, begin running it when you get the chance, and talk about it on your blog or G+. Hopefully, 6 months from now, people will request you run it at conventions or even run it on their own.<br/><br/>Some people make semi-open design work on a shorter cycle and be more collaborative, but that involves tapping into established currents of design and play. Stuff like Dungeon World and World of Dungeons are great examples of that and have generated a fair about of collaboratively-created material in a short amount of time, especially WoD (and Pocket Danger Patrol) because its brevity makes it easier to grok and build on. So if you're designing in a space where there's a built-in audience and you make something that gets their attention, the time window gets smaller, but that also puts the onus on you to produce something solid the first time around, since other folks may be using it immediately.<br/><br/>In general, I would suggest that designing in the open isn't about finding ways to make the game better, though it can sometimes help you discover problems as you try and articulate your thoughts to other people. I really think it's more about fishing for your potential audience, connecting with them, and not letting your design work take place inside your own head too much, but breathe out there in the real world. It takes courage, in fact, because you're letting folks see things that's not perfect, but do you really want to preserve this "mysterious game designer black box" bullshit anyway? That's not how design works, and it's important for folks to know that it's just this thing that anyone can do, not a magical power. Designing in the open can also be about abstaining from responsibility or any sort of fixed time-table for development. You're handing folks everything that you've got and saying: "Hey, you can play and hack this just as easily as I can. What are you waiting on me for?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384633/#Comment_384633" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-09T17:07:09+00:00" title="July  9, 2012  5:07PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all wonderful stuff.
