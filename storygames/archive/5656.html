I'm not saying they are all persuasive, or even right, but they are the ones I can think of.<br/><br/>Charging enables you to cover costs, which in return allows you to spend more on a higher set of production values, e.g. better art than you could do yourself, better editing, and so forth.<br/><br/>Charging enables you to produce a game on paper, with greater print quality than people might get from themselves from, say Lulu (which still involves charging, but you could always have 0 margin for yourself). Which can be a good thing for those who think that printed games are better than PDF ones.<br/><br/>Selling a book gives you different distribution options from giving it away free. I'm not saying better, but different.<br/><br/>Charging for a game may cause it to be taken more seriously than if it is free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126525/#Comment_126525" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:15:27+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:15AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>Yes.

(I might be wrong, though.) But I'm going to assume an absolute in order to make a point.<br/><br/>(ack, I realized in writing this that I'm assuming a guy. Uh, okay, so my hypothetical person is a dude this time. People can read that as gender-flexible, I hope?)<br/><br/>Let's consider the guy who just wants to produce the best aesthetic experience possible. Well, first, if he wants to produce a printed book with nice pretty bits and such, he might want to charge to cover costs. But even assuming someone of infinite wealth, who could afford to print and give away books, he may not want to.<br/><br/>A big part of aesthetic experience is how it (in this case, the game) fits into your day to day life. How you acquired the text (in a store, on the internet, through mail-order, in person through a friend, in person at a con) is a part of this. And how much money you paid is intimately a part of that.<br/><br/>Let's take an extreme example. Let's imagine a game, called "Eyes and Hands" which is in a handsome leatherbound book. Let's think about three ways the game could be acquired:<br/>1) for $30 at a FLGS.<br/>2) For free, in exchange for writing to the author online.<br/>3) Stumbled across in a used bookstore for $15.<br/>4) Directly purchased from the author for $500.<br/><br/>Now, the last one is a bit extreme, but it makes a point. Your relationship with the game is going to be different, your attitude around it will be different, depending on the situation you came across it and how much you paid.<br/><br/>As an artist, part of my decision making process is 'how much do I want someone to pay for this?' Sometimes reality (production costs, profit concerns) infringes, but it's a relatively big deal.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126544/#Comment_126544" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:33:18+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:33AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Asking you for money so I can cover my costs, or pay for printing, or pay artists, or whatever is not the same as asking you for money just so I can make a profit.</blockquote>\nThat is different.

Because it cost me money to get server space for it I had to ask for donations to cover my costs. When donations didn't cut it I instituted a charging scheme, where people paid for more features, and helped cover costs in the process, which worked fine. Over time, as I put more effort and time into it I decided it was fine to make a profit too, if that ever happened.<br/><br/>Now I have thought about what would happen if I were to win the lottery. Obviously I would splash out on better hardware, and pay the people who volunteer to help mod the game in more than perks (I have offered them money already, and they have turned me down, but if I was a millionaire they'd have to take my cash <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> and so on, but would I stop charging for premium accounts, in-game money and the like? I've come to the conclusion that no, I wouldn't stop, because charging for those things gives them value in the eyes of the players, and in the game. In game money wouldn't mean much if you could just click a button to get loads of it any time you wanted, not like paying real money for it does, and so on.<br/><br/>I think the same applies to an RPG. Even if I was rich I might feel that it devalued my (hypothetical beautifully hand-crafted) game to give it away for free. I might not charge more than it cost to make, after all, I'd be a millionaire, but that doesn't mean I'd charge nothing either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126561/#Comment_126561" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:49:00+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Necessity:  No.  People publish for free.

It took time (which has value), took materials (a computer and software for a PDF at the very least), and took resources to deliver.

People say to themselves, if the author can afford to give it away for free it probably means it didn't involve much effort to produce, which probably means it's not worth my time. There is that idea that free = no good. If something is being sold for money we assume that it involved greater investment, and that in turn (we feel) implies better quality.

If it does well, I offer a bonus. I do not write it into the contract but I think it is a good thing to do. I recently did something similar with the new version of Roma (the True20 version) for the artists who worked on Roma Iridium.<br/><br/>As to the morality of profits, I have no problem with it but I think I have a different definition than some in this thread. Net profit is essentially, what I get paid. Gross profits pay both me and the staff who worked on the book. I am the one who took the risk on the book, I should reap the rewards. If I ever entered into a deal with an artist and they assumed some risk I would most certainly share the profits as agreed on in the contract.<br/><br/>And just to confuse things further, I offer my books for free on my site as well as for pay PDFs and pay for print versions. I am not opposed to free versions of books but as has been noted, the two main reasons for charging is to make money and create value for your game. You can do the latter without charging money but it is far more difficult.<br/><br/>Of course, all of the above is just my take on the OP question.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126711/#Comment_126711" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T18:18:02+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  6:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mm. See, now.. I've an interesting perspective on this. At least, it's interesting to me. <br/><br/>I have only bought one PDF of a game, and that was because the game itself was (I was told?) out of print, and I was told that one of my works-in-progress bore a striking resemblence to The Whispering Vault. So I bought a PDF. <br/><br/>As a rule, I don't think much of the idea of buying PDFs. It's just a thing with me. I could spend a lot less money on the PDF and just play it off my laptop and have much the same convenience of a hardcopy book, plus some of the additional benefits of a digital copy (searching, et al). But I don't. There's just something about having a hard copy of a game that just *feels right*. Obviously I wouldn't expect to get a free hard copy, unless it was maybe an ashcan.. But I want a product. <br/><br/>Now, this doesn't really apply to the various free PDFs out there. I'll admit to having a couple PDFs of big deal commercial products, but these are things I'd never spend my money on anyway. I'm not talking about those. I'm talking about no shit free PDFs. Except a copy of Paladin, I don't own any free PDFs, and other than skimming Paladin (a game that I was excitedly waiting for a rumored second edition of at one point) I've not read any, either. <br/><br/>Ryan Stoughton talks about a few of his projects that he plans to give away for free, and I find that I've no interest. Having talked to the guy in person a few times, I've no doubt that he's put real love and effort into at least one of his projects, but still I find myself discounting them, and when I examine it, I have to realize it's the "free" part. I might download such a product because I like Ryan and I think he's got some interesting ideas, but I'd probably never really look into it because of that cost:value assumption built into my mental workup. <br/><br/>Basically, in my mind free is good for playtest editions, and for sharing with friends. If you want people to play your game, people you don't know, you find a good price-point, and you sell it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sean2099" title="sean2099"><img alt="sean2099" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sean2099">sean2099</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126716/#Comment_126716" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T19:12:17+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  7:12PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To the original OP: Ignoring the greater political and socioeconomic issues attached to your question, I am picking up an undercurrent of "it is altruistic to give away your game."

Putting it on the internet for free (whether in HTML or PDF form) enables people who wouldn't normally be able to acquire it to have access to it. With stuff like the articles in Push, this greatly facilitates the discussion and understanding of roleplaying, allowing better communication between disparate roleplaying communities.<br/><br/>2. <i>Freedom of Use</i>: Say someone wants to hack or translate your game or do something else with it.  Starting from print form, this is really difficult, even if your product is open or you're happy to have them do it.  Sure, they can contact you and ask for it, but it's much easier if they can just have at it.  This lets people do things like, copy and post bits of your game on mailing lists and forums without much trouble, spreading word about your game.<br/><br/>3. <i>Linkability</i>: Speaking of spreading the words, games that are available online can be <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/mwaantaangaand/" rel="nofollow">hyperlinked to</a>, making them far more useful in discussions than saying like, "You should check out Polaris and Agon, because they do some of the things that you're asking about."  With anchors placed in the text, you can even link to a specific sections of the rules.<br/><br/>4. <i>Fighting the Class / Disposable Income / Investment Issue</i>: Roleplaying is dominated by people with enough disposable income that they can participate in a largely commercialized hobby where the basic entry costs for running D&amp;D are getting upwards of $150 and the purchase of at least a half-dozen $20-30 supplements is the expected norm.  In general, books are steadily becoming more expensive.  This ups the requirements for entry into the hobby, making it harder for many people to feel like roleplaying is accessible to them.  Piracy is a solution for some (like pretty much the entire Chinese roleplaying community, which has a mixture of price / access issues), but free internet distribution might be another.<br/><br/>5. <i>Honorable Ancestors</i>: Donjon, Drowning &amp; Falling, Dungeon Squad, Nicotine Girls, The Pool, TSOY, Shadows, Snowball, The Window.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126792/#Comment_126792" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T08:08:05+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  8:08AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the profit factor is something you should consider from the moment you are starting to conceptualize your project.<br/><br/>There are some games that could work very well with the <i>free</i> style, and wouldn't require too much work or expenses.<br/><br/>On the other hands, some games would require a greater resources expendure, or could work a lot better with pro quality elements...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126796/#Comment_126796" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T08:25:56+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  8:25AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2008 9:21AM by Eric Provost.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Edit:  Whoops.

There are exceptions, of course: if someone gives me a gift, then it's got added value as a token of that person's regard for me in addition to its value as a thing. If I go see a band I like in concert and buy a tee shirt, then that tee shirt is also a reminder of my experience seeing the band and is therefore more valuable to me than if I'd just bought the same tee shirt over the internet or whatever. But for the most part, if I even <i>remember</i> where or how I got ahold of something, that's nothing more than an emotionally neutral anecdote that has no bearing on my perception of the object's value.<br/><br/>As far as immoral -- I don't know that I'd go <i>that</i> far.

The only "I like it <i>and</i>..." modifiers that come to mind are: <br/><br/>1) "...it's extra special because someone gave it to me as a gift", or <br/>2) "...I can have interesting conversations with other people who like it."<br/><br/>On the other hand, the number if "I like it <i>but</i>..." scenarios is much, much larger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126855/#Comment_126855" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T11:20:29+00:00" title="February 15, 2008 11:20AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>And who are all these people downloading free things from the Internet and not even reading them?</blockquote>\nHeh.

As such, I want the long-tail effect to steadily increase my hourly rate for the time I spend writing, rewriting, testing, promoting, supporting, laying out, doing (or buying or finding) artwork, managing my sales site portal (whatever that will eventually be), and supporting customers post-sale.<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Even if I felt I wanted a game to be "free," I'd still want a print distribution option (see below) and, as such, I'd have to charge for POD, even though I might not add a profit margin to the print product's final price.<br/>C) Even downloads cost money, in terms of bandwidth. Now, sure, for most small projects, it would take a thousand (tens of thousands of?) downloads a month to hit most hosting limits. Or there's the basic monthly fees for hosting, or the cost of maintaining a private server and static IP. It's all costs, at one level or another: there is no such thing as totally free online distribution.<br/><br/>My perspective, as a player:<br/>I don't want a PDF or a webpage in front of me when I am playing--I live enough of my life in the glow of a computer screen. I want a book, in hand, bound. Often, for me to do that myself at Kinkos involves reformatting, page controls, de-hyperlinking, going to Kinkos, paying 7\xa2 a page (for nicer paper) plus the price to bind it ($2 or more)... hell, at then end of all that, accounting for my time and what it's worth, it costs me MORE to use a "free" downloaded game than it would ever cost me to buy it as a book from IPR or wherever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126930/#Comment_126930" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T13:44:45+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  1:44PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if this whole "charging as part of the aesthetic experience" is part of why people who aren't opposed to free RPGs in theory still get miffed if someone pirates their for-money game ... it'd be the same, on some levels, as people looking at the game with pages missing.

But I treat differently (without thinking about it) free games that aren't pdfs. I don't print them, and so I never play them. (when I wanted to play SoY I brought a bound copy, I didn't want a printout of a web page).<br/><br/>I don't know how common is this, but it shows to me that there are many variables in the interest a game gets, more important that money, and presentation is one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127134/#Comment_127134" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-17T07:22:03+00:00" title="February 17, 2008  7:22AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may make a difference to my enthusiasm for PDF games that I work in a paper-intensive field where running off 50 pages on the printer takes less than a minute and is such a tiny drop in the flood of paper my office produces every hour (yes, hour) that nobody could even muster up the possibility of caring.

This tends to apply to "experience or credence goods" ~ ones that you can't truly evaluate prior to purchase (compared to a music CD you might hear songs from, or a magazine you can leaf through).  Marketers of things like identity theft insurance or 'credit report fraud monitoring' have found that offering it cheaply leads to fewer sales than raising the price a bit.  Consumers mistakenly use price as a short-hand indicator of value rather than simply what they are asked to give in exchange for the value.<br/><br/>In terms of "applying oneself to a product", the same behaviourial psych says you will probably make more effort to read through a product you buy than one you get for free.  Though post-purchase you are in the same situation (you're not getting your money back, it's a sunk cost, you can only now spend more time on the product or not), people look at the money spent as a decision they must "validate" by reading the book etc.<br/><br/>The ashcanor playtest approach likely navigates these issues pretty well.  People expect it to be free/lower cost and don't discount its value because of that, they understand editing issues and other problems likely with any smaller press product (even professional writers have professional editors) and won't savage it for that they way they would a hardback published product, and they will apply themselves because they are interested (having self selected) in working through the product to see if it holds together in order to give feed back.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5656/is-there-a-value-to-charging" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5656/is-there-a-value-to-charging" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5656/is-there-a-value-to-charging/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5656%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5656%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
