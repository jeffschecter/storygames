I'm not thinking map creation during play, like Black Fire or some other games (including my entry for GC), but using a pre-bought map.<br/>P.P.S.

When I see a cool map, I want to grab it. But I can't always come up with a use for it. I have to discipline myself pretty seriously.<br/><br/>Actually, that's a lie. I don't discipline myself at all.<br/><br/>Here are some ways I use or have used maps:<br/> <br/>- As in Trollbabe, where each player gets to point at the map and say "I am here". You could probably do this with almost any kind of information graphic, like a relationship map or a timeline.<br/><br/>- As a visual aid to put on the table as a way of establishing mood and focus. Maybe once in a while someone points at it to establish location, maybe not. This is awesome with historical maps. We did it with Renaissance Venice, and although the map wasn't really required for any utility, it did help keep the setting crisp in our minds. Something as simple as "oh yeah, there are canals here" can really help.<br/><br/>- As a context for your campaign, like the map inside the front cover of a good fantasy novel, it's something to measure your campaign against. Maybe your game starts in the slums of Oxford, but ends up on a noble estate. Here's a neat gimmick: point to the map and ask the players to tell you where their characters live, just as a way of establishing characters.<br/><br/>- To provide fodder for conflict. As Kynn says, you're here and you need to get there. Unfortunately, the shortest route is through a crime-ridden slum/ across a river/ through a noble's private preserve/ in an uncharted nebula.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146024/#Comment_146024" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T10:27:26+00:00" title="May 26, 2008 10:27AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My survival horror game <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/giger/" rel="nofollow">Geiger Counter</a> has drawing a map of the setting as a central mechanic.  Locations have mechanical functions too.  All scenes take place in fixed locations.  Characters can be "trapped" in a single location as a result of losing a conflict.  In the "Black &amp; Gaunt" scenario, the zombies actually gradually occupy all the space on the board, herding the PCs into a smaller and smaller "safe" area (those rules came out of the last playtest, though, and haven't been written up yet).  That's kind of a variation on the old battlemap theme, though, since it's spatially based.  <br/><br/>There's also a ton of thematic stuff you can do with diagrams, but I think you should talk more about your ley line idea, where you could map surges of magic energy through the local "curcuit."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146030/#Comment_146030" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T10:55:12+00:00" title="May 26, 2008 10:55AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted to avoid talking about lewy lines, lest I steer the conversation that way an miss something interesting someone else may think up. I guess it's hard to avoid 'battlemap' or 'setting flavour' when it comes to maps. The thought occures that using a bit of red thread (representing the line between safe and infested) then tightening it like a noose around the player's position might be interesting for a zombie type game.<br/><br/>That said, here's some of the ideas I had about ley-lines...<br/><br/>Players are magicians/geomancer and have a sanctum marked on the map. Ley-lines are drawn on in pencil and must be moved by in-game actions to form magical symbols. The cross sections of ley-lines (nexus points / dragon nests) give a particular 'flavour' to the magic, i.e. if a nexus was on a quarry it would be good at fueling earth magic.<br/><br/>Each spell would require a particular pattern of nodes to work, based on nodes and how they are connected, not the lengths of the lines (too fiddly).<br/><br/>The game would probably be quite political, about who controls what nexus points, especialy since magic would be the slow ritual kind, nothing you cast on the fly (although maybe you could empower charms to let you sometimes). You could also add some Cthulhu-style evil cultists as antagonists.<br/><br/>John,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson" title="Zak Arntson"><img alt="Zak Arntson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/147/nVMQWQSYECWCV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson">Zak Arntson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146032/#Comment_146032" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T11:03:40+00:00" title="May 26, 2008 11:03AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear the upcoming <a href="http://giantsrpg.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Giants RPG</a> uses maps in its system.

The one I'm most proud of is <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/projects/mwaantaangaand/" rel="nofollow">Mwaantaangaand</a>, in which the monsters have an impact by changing what certain spaces on the board mean (the monsters are explicitly non-mechanical, they just affect how the imagery of the game is described, which I find really delicious).  Here's an example:\n<blockquote><b>Kumayuwa / Jinga / Nyambango</b> is a plague spirit associated with menstruation, \u201cderived from a female relative who died a violent death especially involving the spilling of her blood.\u201d Now corrupted, the ancestral spirit has possessed all who once lived in the place wherein she was loosed, making them spill the blood of all those around them, making the ground heavy and wet. She embeds Kala and Kala Rising (\u201dbirth\u201d) with the meaning \u201cGore\u201d at strength 5 (this potency is shared by those two spaces) and any characters currently in the Mpemba part of the diagram must deal with her arrival as if they were in an affected space.</blockquote>\nYou could easily do something like that with a map as well, projecting certain effects onto parts of the terrain or characters currently in it, as if a witch was cursing an entire swath of territory or something.  Or, like Jason said, bombing the hell out of something and dealing with the radiation effects afterwards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146219/#Comment_146219" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T12:37:34+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 12:37PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'm toying with a similarly post-apocalypse project where you toss coins onto a state road map and then trace the radius of each coin.

I mean, don't get me wrong, watching the gelatinous cubes be fruitful and multiple is awesome, but there could be other applications of this as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146245/#Comment_146245" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T14:04:08+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  2:04PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Off the top of my head, what if your rolling, flipping, or what ever actually created the map?  The 'landing spots' would be terrain features and different tossed tokens would represent different terrain.  Similar to Jason's idea but back it up some more.  A random map generator that the players could make themselves based on what they wanted to adventure into that day.  Coins give you 4-5 different terrain types by themselves.  Add dice and you get 5 or 6 more.  Pencils as roads?  Blocks as buildings.  Toss them on the page and trace around them and you have your urban setting or dungeon.  It is like the number generated map that was talked about a couple of months ago but more tactile.<br/>\nThe ecology idea is really sweet.  Environment shapes society.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152501/#Comment_152501" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T15:36:01+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  3:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw a couple draw-the-map-as-you-go games during the last Game Chef, but I haven't seen too many that use an actual, pre-published map as anything but a game board. That's an intriguing idea. I like maps, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could always include a mechanic where players all take a look at the map and write down a place on it (or some coordinates) on a 3x5 or scratch paper, then list something special about that area, something that's triggered when you move into it. Then you could have a set amount of events that you distribute and have those triggered by the movement of characters into different areas of the map. If you wanted to make it more sophisticated, you could split play into several timed stages and have each player list a different event for each stage (or even allow them to purposely skip a few stages here and there. There's no event at Fifth and Vine in the Crisis Stage.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could have each player carry a map and use those maps as movement or who-gets-the-next-scene resolution by this method: each player picks a spot on their map and compares it with the spot the other players have picked (all players should reveal the spots they picked at once.) Depending on how close to the current target number or chart of map key symbols or secret word of the moment each player got, they'd have some control over the next phase of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
