Basically it's a short game about making the other players laugh and having zany adventures.  It's a GM-less game where everyone has a character.  Non player elements of the game world are controlled by spending coins.  Each player starts with a couple coins, with more awarded in play by other players for making them laugh (or other defined ways of doing awesome things in the game, people don't actually laugh out that loud at many of the very funny jokes of the h2g2 style).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe base mechanic seems to be working, my problem is coming up with some kind of pacing mechanic.  I've tried rules for defining 'trouble' of certain sizes where you have to spend 5 or 10 coins to overcome it, but the narrative never matches up with the coin limit.  For the size troubles we've had 5 is too few and 10 is too many.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how to keep the game moving?  Is this even something I really need to worry about?  The last time I ran it it basically didn't use this mechanic, as everyone just kept tossing out coins (I was running with the 5 coin requirement and doing the accounting myself, so I just said we're good when people asked if we had enough coins to be done).  I'm concerned though that you could game the system and solve trouble by only spending a coin or two, thus never really needing to be funny.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181812/#Comment_181812" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T18:51:39+00:00" title="December  5, 2008  6:51PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for referencing ...in Spaaace!  I've read through the rules part, it is very similar to the style of game that I want, but different in a lot of ways.  Maybe I should play it and see how it goes.  The ways in which ...in Spaaace! is different than what I was thinking about are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I want a GM-less game so that everyone has direct control over what the story elements are.  This is augmented with some mad-libs done before play that are drawn as suggestions (for now) for new trouble, and establishing other things about the nature of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I want only way to gain coins to be being funny, and they come from the bank, not other players.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I don't want to get bogged down with bidding, in my boardgaming experience this usually takes much too long as people agonize over how much to bid.  I also don't want to deal with player conflict that much, but have a much more whatever goes attitude (right now I think rules are you can spend a coin to say no).  Play goes very fast, we deal with each 'trouble' in 5 to 10 minutes I think.  The whole game runs in somewhere near an hour with rules explanations and setup.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate your suggestions.  Setting the limit based on the number of coins awarded sounds very interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181832/#Comment_181832" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T21:37:06+00:00" title="December  5, 2008  9:37PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another game you might want to look at for inspiration might be <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/SUPER_ACTION_NOW_3.htm" rel="nofollow">Super Action Now!</a>, which is also an everyone has a character crazy adventure get points for being funny game. It's not in your genre, but it's pretty great and might serve to give you some ideas. Good luck on your game. Hitchhikers guide is a pretty awesome setting, and definitely deserves its own RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182155/#Comment_182155" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T11:38:29+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 11:38AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            whiteknife,<br/>Thanks, I was just about to say that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>timonkey,<br/>I wrote <i>Super Action Now!</i>, and your ideas are quite similar in some ways, so I think it likely that there's stuff in SAN! that can help you.  I would be <i>delighted</i> to discuss it and your game with you, if you think that it can help.<br/><br/>I can tell you right now how pacing is handled in SAN!.  Three major pieces:<br/><br/>1) Random stuff being interjected into the situation, by drawing stuff from a hat<br/>2) Players (and usually but not always PCs) deliberately one-upping and screwing each other over<br/>3) The Drive mechanic, which "fuels" PCs with a finite pool of points that are spent to use Powers and ignore Inconvenience (damage); these points are restored by accomplishing something toward your Drive.  Like, if you're Chainsaw the Angry Bear, "Driven by rage and vengeance against poachers, litterers, and other defilers of nature," you'd get Drive points if you, say, stopped someone from starting a forest fire by clocking them with a shovel ("Prevent THIS!").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
