They could basically make everything up as they went along. It was a diceless game. It used two decks of cards to add randomness, a fortune deck and a vision deck.<br/><br/>The fortune deck included 36 card that could be pulled when some kind of task resolution came up. The GM interpreted what it meant. <br/><br/>The vision deck of 90 cards included suggestive scenes with interesting questions to spur creativity. Again it was interpreted by the GM.<br/><br/>Sounds like this game required a very creative and active referee. The cards did not mechanically make anything happen but just suggested things.  In this way I wonder if cards are really part of the system. The GM making shit up with no set limits on their power is the system. The cards were just ancillary. Still it was a seminal game that broke the mode of role play games and suffered the economic penalty for that reason.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417492/#Comment_417492" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T18:45:07+00:00" title="June 29, 2013  6:45PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fairy Tale Assassin League<br/>Chris Engle/Hamster Press<br/>2013<br/><br/>In this game all the players are equal. Most play a fairy tale hero in modern day Las Vegas. One player runs the bad guy. The games is all about how the heroes defeat the bad guy. It uses character and location cards to make a game board. It uses action and scene cards to guide play. Players want to win action and scene cards to win victory points to determine who gets the last word in the game.<br/><br/>There are 4 scene cards guide play through a coherent story.<br/><br/>There are up to 54 action cards that have suggestive pictures and phrases. Players have a hand of five action cards. They draw back to five cards as they use them.<br/><br/>Each turn a player plays an action card or scene card and make up what happens next. Other players play a card and add to or alter the story. Players roll to see who gets the victory points but actions generally happen regardless of the roll.<br/><br/>The cards are suggestive, like they are in Every Way, but each player has full creative power. The cards limit choices which helps people be more creative (one of life's little paradoxes). The cards are central to play because of this limitation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417494/#Comment_417494" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T19:09:37+00:00" title="June 29, 2013  7:09PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Magic the Gathering<br/>Wizards of the Coast <br/>1993<br/><br/>Not a role play game but definitely the most influential of card games.<br/><br/>Players build decks by running on the treadmill of collectibility.

You draw four cards and may play up to all four on each task - if the suit matches, you get the face value of the card, otherwise you get 1.  The downfall of this system is you IMMEDIATELY REFRESH THE HAND. Blah. In all but the most extreme cases (i.e. I know I'm going to get in a big physical confrontation so I know I need to save this high-ranking card), it's to your advantage to just play all four cards every time.

Everyone has 8 stats, these are added to or subtracted from by skills and traits. A lot of times you just add everything up and if you beat the target number, you succeed.  But sometimes you roll two ten sided dice - add the result of one and subtract the result of the other. Both ten sided dice can "explode" when a 10 is rolled. You also have a hand of cards that can provide big bonuses, especially when played together, based on your Luck score. These don't regenerate until the end of the session.  Everyone loved their Cards in this game so much, though the balance between hoarding, delaying the end of the session, and getting grouchy with a fellow player for getting tired and proposing ending the session before you spent your limited Cards, it didn't work perfectly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417501/#Comment_417501" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T20:48:20+00:00" title="June 29, 2013  8:48PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Untold: the RPG (2010)<br/><br/>You didn't even hear about this one, did you? That's right, because you blinked, and missed that someone printed approximately a hojillion copies of this hand-building card-based battle and RPG game, whose rules were printed on fold-out handouts inside each deck, and where there were expansions for each faction/race, and you could read all about it on the website <a href="http://untoldthegame.com" rel="nofollow">UntoldTheGame.Com</a>, go ahead, click it, I'll wait!<br/><br/>Because I love each and every one of God's abandoned creatures, including this game, I'm gonna tell you all about it.  Basically you had a pool of points which you used to purchase traits, equipment, and so on, each of which was represented by a card. Each card had rules detailing when and how often you could use the card.  Like maybe your gun you could fire once per round, so when you used it, you flipped it, and then at the top of the round you flipped it back. <br/><br/>There were a lot of good kernels in this game, like the advancement system - each card was marked with how you got them (like, you have to go on a quest to get this magic sword, or you have to be trained to use this martial arts style) and story-gamers would like the "implied setting" that came with just cool-looking pictures and awesome-sounding names for things, including locations.  I also like that the GM had a budget by which he filled out the challenges the PCs would face.<br/><br/>But in general it was really underexplained and hard to follow.<br/><br/>For additional lols, here's something from the Facebook page:<br/><br/>"Hey gents, sorry for the delay in response time. Untold is currently on hold thanks to the economy we had to make a number of adjustments across the board. It's not dead just cocooned for the time being. We are revamping our set up due to killer feed back from fans like you guys. There was a lot of request for setting books that fleshed out the three worlds we have currently so that is in the works along with a fantasy setting and a futuristic space setting. As you can see a lot on the plate from a developing stand point. I will send both you guys a personal contact to place orders for any current decks you may need. Feel free to tell anyone else looking for decks.

Basically, you draw a single card from a deck of playing cards and add the value to your skill in order to see if you beat a target number.  You can add additional draws through spending luck points called Fortune, and certain magical effects permit additional draws, or "draw and keep the highest" results and things like that. I'm not super thrilled with this one because really it's just a d52, it doesn't do much with the cards <i>as cards</i> but whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417503/#Comment_417503" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T20:59:31+00:00" title="June 29, 2013  8:59PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Primetime Adventures (2004)<br/><br/>Do I need to go into this one here?

These goals were drawn at the beginning of the session. The winner was the one who reached their goal first, which finished the story. Before they can do that, they had to involve all their cards on their hands, that they also drew at the beginning of the session. The cards had a picture, a short word that explained the picture - a word that had to be used during the narration - and a theme. When the word was mentioned, they played the card so everyone could see that the card was used.<br/><br/>Only one player narrated at the time, but could loose the right in three ways: by leaving the word over to the person to the left, by narrating in a non-fairy tale like way,  or by being interrupted. When the narrative right was lost, that person had to draw a card. If the narrator choose to leave the word over, that person was also allowed throw away a card.<br/><br/>You could be interrupted in two ways. The easiest way was to use interrupt cards that could be played when the narrator played a card with the same theme as the interrupt card. The slightly harder way was when the narrator mentioned a word that you had on one of the cards. This created a tactic of establishing cards on beforehand. If you had a princess on your hand, you could make her important in the story but not playing your card. When the next person took over and told the tale about the princess, you could play your card and take back the narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417523/#Comment_417523" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T04:41:45+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  4:41AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Primetime Adventures (2004)<br/><br/>Do I need to go into this one here?

The player taking a turn "kicks down a door" (the start of the narration?) and draws a card. If it is a monster they compare their present level to the monster's level. If they are higher, they win.

For instance, with Murderous Ghosts, if winning the hand just substitutes in as a die roll to determin a winner but doesn't add to narration then maybe it doesn't fit here. <br/><br/>I did include Magic the Gathering, though, which has NO story, because it is so widely known and has likely limited the development of cards as a story mechanic because of its popularity. <br/><br/>Other games, like Gloom and Munchkin, don't really have meaningful narration but because it happens and is part of the fun of the game, I included them.<br/><br/>Hope that clears up the intent of the thread.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I went back and corrected the spelling.

I will only describe the fast resolution system. What is noticeable is that a conflict is played out as a dialogue. Each turn, you may draw cards from attitudes, emotions and traits but only from each group once. There are four attitudes - confrontation, manipulation, flight and aid -, six emotions ordered as three pairs with two opposites in each, and traits that defines who you are and the relations to the other characters. All these things have numbers and those numbers tell you the amount of cards that you can draw each turn. You can only draw from one source once during a conflict, so you can't draw from, for example, Confrontation twice or more times.<br/><br/>What you use to draw cards from colours the dialogue. If you draw from the attitude Aid and the trait Cop, you will aid with help from the experience as a police officer. Each turn, you must either forfeit or draw cards. If you draw cards, you must play one or more cards of the same rank that are higher than the previously played cards. Single cards are always beat by two of a kind who are beat by three of a kind, and so on. If you forfeit or can't play any higher cards after drawing new, you will loose the conflict.<br/><br/>(I can't remember it to well, but I think it works as) The more card you have on the hand when the conflict is over, the more backlash you will suffer from the conflict. The looser must also pick up the previously played cards. If someone forfeited, they can first throw away their own hand and then pick up the played cards.<br/><br/>The backlash consist of raising the numbers. If any number reaches ten, the character is written out of the story. The game ends when two characters have shared this fate.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's a houserule, but we played with two decks that both had jokers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417549/#Comment_417549" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T07:24:59+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  7:24AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2013 7:32AM by zircher.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Trouble with Rose</b> (2012) uses a standard deck and the suit of the card determines your character's secret agenda each game (love, profit from, defend, or kill the main NPC.)

I prefer to deal with questions in the open. <br/><br/>First I could be dead wrong in including Magic here. So your concern could be more on target than mine.<br/><br/>My reasoning for including it is my impression back in 93. That what Magic had done was to basically take a D+D like combat game and put it into cards. Stripping out all the role play from it kind of like what early computer games did. My impression here could be wrong as well. Magic never appealed to me so I've not studied it much. If I'm right though, Magic is one way to use cards to run a part of a RPG.<br/><br/>More importantly though is Magic's influence on game design. Just like D+D defined what an RPG looked like for way too long, Magic defined what a card game looked like. Think how much creative energy went into other collectible card games. Energy that could have been spent else where. I acknowledge that influence and hope we move beyond it. I don't want to slam Magic, but I don't think it's model will lead to good role playing, and certainly not narrative games. <br/><br/>Those are my thoughts. I really didn't go deeper than that. Magic is a negative example and nothing more.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

rank of face cards) is used for several different mechanics. Character generation uses the Major Arcana only, and only the Minor Arcana are used for task/conflict resolution. Players who wish their characters to take an action play a card; actions are keyed to the four suits, and if the card played is of the appropriate suit, it may be replaced in hand immediately. Non-suit actions may still succeed if numerically sufficient, but are not replaced immediately. Characterization is reinforced by allowing players to replenish any remaining cards at the end of a scene for roleplaying pre-defined personality attributes. Personality attributes may reciprocally aid in relevant actions by adding their values to played cards for dramatically appropriate actions. Hands of cards also represent characters' health/magic/durability, and harm or trauma cause hands to deplete.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RedwoodR" title="RedwoodR"><img alt="RedwoodR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RedwoodR">RedwoodR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417575/#Comment_417575" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T16:13:09+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  4:13PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sacred Steel<br/>Neil de Carteret<br/>2004 (Dev release - there was never a final one, as far as I know)<br/><br/>Cards were either marked with a success or a failure (50/50 mix) - the card sheet in the PDF had green check marks and red x's. Each player (plus the GM) has a separate deck. Draw a number of cards equal to your appropriate trait, attempting to get at least one success. Bonuses and penalties affected the number of cards drawn, and opposed checks were also often used. Decks would only be reshuffled if they ran out.<br/><br/>While this could have been done trivially with dice, the intent was that having a deck guaranteed that luck would even out over the course of a session - if you started out with a bunch of lucky draws early, you'd definitely be getting more of failures as you reached the last few cards of the deck (and vice versa).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417578/#Comment_417578" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T16:32:42+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  4:32PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2013 7:24PM by Rickard.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does that make sense?</blockquote>\nNo, but that's only because I disagree with you all the way through.:) If I recall correctly, Richard Garfield wanted to sell the RoboRally to Wizards of the Coast but even if they liked the idea they wanted him to create another game so they could see his capacity, much like the Wachowskis had to do Bound before the Matrix trilogy. He did that by creating Magic the Gathering for them.<br/><br/>I don't think that Magic even the sightliest resembles D+D combat. I actually wish someone did a strategic cards game as a combat system though, because it would be cool for a <i>competitive</i> roleplaying game. I wish that someone actually did a <i>good</i> strategic combat system for once. Even the CCG idea would interesting to see in form of a roleplaying game but these are ideas that are fit for another thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I do think, just like you, that a lot of designers have gazed upon Magic when they were about to create their own CCG and I agree that such behaviour shrunk the originality but I can't believe it in any form affected roleplaying games.<br/><br/>But in the end, it's just a matter of different opinions between you and me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Oh, and what happened to RoboRally?

Each takes turns; on your turn you play one card from your hand and narrate the next part of the scene according to what card you play. Different cards allow for different kinds of narration, both in general and for specific characters.<br/><br/><b>The Tulip Academy Society For Dangerous Gentlemen</b><br/>Nick Smith<br/>2011<br/><br/>This game uses playing cards differently in several different ways. At the start of an episode you draw a single card to determine the general theme of the game session, and for each scene after the first the player hosting the scene draws two cards to determine its location and who is present. In a Conflict of Science, each participating player gets a hand of 8 cards, and they take turns playing progressively higher cards until one can't play one that's any higher. In Conflicts of Art they also get hands of 8 cards, but play them face-down, and you can call a player on their bluff. In Conflicts of Fencing each duelist gets a deck of 10 cards, and when the other player plays a card, you have 3 chances to flip over a higher card to win that volley of the duel. The winner adds any cards used in a volley to their own dueling deck, until one player gets all of the cards. There are some other bits and pieces, but that's the essence of the game.<br/><br/><b>Maid RPG</b><br/>Ryo Kamiya<br/>2008 (English Version)<br/><br/>The game normally just goes totally crazy with rolling dice, but there is one scenario in it that uses playing cards in an interesting way. The "Maidenrangers of Love and Justice" scenario (p. 172-174) has you set up a 4x4 grid of playing cards representing a map of the mansion. The scenario runs in turns, and during each turn the players have opportunities to move from room to room. Upon arriving in a room the player flips over its card, and the value of the card determines what's inside.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417582/#Comment_417582" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T19:22:45+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  7:22PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>But in the end, it's just a matter of different opinions between you and me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Oh, and what happened to RoboRally?

I've made cards that simulate dice for games I've run, and I've made my own-card based system. I'm currently working on one that uses the tarot deck. I would LOVE to talk more about it at this point, but it is still very much in development. That said:<br/><br/><b>Fortune's Fool</b><br/>Pantheon Press<br/>2010<br/><br/>Uses Tarot cards (the inspiration for me to try my hand at it) for resolution and character creation. The skills are kind of tough on the characters, but the idea is great: While building your character, you are assigned Major Arcana. When you pull these cards for resolution, Fortune Shines (exceptional success). When you pull Major Arcana that aren't assigned to you, Fortune Weeps (exceptional failure). Also, your race (the game is set in a fantasy renaissance Earth) determines which suits favored you. If you pull a suit that favors you, Fortune Smiles (either a good success or not-so-bad a failure depending on the number of the card). If you pull a suit that doesn't favor you, Fortune Frowns (either a scant success or a poor failure, again, depending on the number of the card). <br/><br/>What they do really well are called Fate Twists. Players get ways to manipulate the deck. Maybe they can turn Death face up in the deck so you always know where it is, or maybe they shuffle certain cards into the top three or five of the deck.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417585/#Comment_417585" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T20:14:46+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  8:14PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2013 8:16PM by nemomeme.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric J Boyd's <b>House of Cards</b> and Michael O'Sullivan's <b>Criminal Element</b> (not the 24-hour rpg version) are two great heist movie genre games that I adore.

I made a hundred copies of it in a three booklet set and sold them over the next three years. <br/><br/>The game included a set of cards with action words on them. This was the matrix of the game. It included ideas central to war game campaigns like: Move, retreat, morale, tactical advantage, supply problems, weather, etc. The card were laid out on a table next to a terrain board or game map (I billed them as miniatures games back then). The players would make strategic moves on an area map and fight battles using a quick set of miniatures rules (not important to the present discussion). Campaign actions were done by "arguments".<br/><br/>Each player in turn would step up to the laid out cards and pick one to be the ACTION they were doing, another to be the RESULT, and three cards to be the REASONS to support the argument. Players who argued later could disagree with earlier arguments using the logic "Yes and" "Yes but" or "No actually". The game used a skilled referee who listened to all the arguments and helped decide where these logical conflicts existed (if the player's were not explicit). Players then rolled a dice to see if their action happened. The roll could be better or worse if the referee though the argument was strong or weak. Players in logical conflict rolled for their arguments in a sudden death contest. The last one standing was the winner. <br/><br/>The weakness of this game (aside from a lack of production qualities) was that bad dice rolls blocked player creativity which kills energy in the game. Also it used a very skilled referee who could listen to ten arguments and then be able to tell which were in conflict and which weren't. I happen to be very good at that so I didn't realize that most people aren't. <br/><br/>This was a competitive game so in that way was different from the story games of now - that are much more collaborative. Much closer to the war game roots of the hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417633/#Comment_417633" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-01T20:03:10+00:00" title="July  1, 2013  8:03PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dust Devils<br/>Matt Snyder<br/>2002<br/><br/>This wild west game uses poker hands to resolve conflicts.

The player with the highest numbered card narrates, so  player who lost the conflict might still be the one to narrate the scene. I could see  that leading to some fun/petty narrations.

They are drawn when the character attempts something dramatic/difficult/for which randomization would make the story more interesting. They\u2019re interpreted by one of the players (the player whose action it is chooses which player should interpret the card) and the results are incorporated in the story by the whole group.<br/><br/>The cards read \u201cYes, and\u2026\u201d, \u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d, \u201cYes, but only if\u2026\u201d, \u201cHelp is needed\u201d and similar, with a little additional text on each.<br/><br/>*The chance cards* can be drawn once per session per player, at any point in the story. They\u2019re interpreted by the player who draws them. They\u2019re designed to infuse the game with surrealism. <br/><br/>Some examples: <br/><br/>\u201cCut Scene: Jump forward three hours. Describe what conditions the characters find themselves in. You\u2019re not allowed to describe what has happened in the meantime.\u201d<br/>\u201cNemesis!

If I remember correctly the core mechanics work roughly like this: each skill, attribute or piece of equipment has its own card. There's no 'rating' - you either have an attribute/skill/thing or not. (Like: quick-thinking, resilient, trained shooter, shotgun). When you receive damage, you have to discard that many cards. When you use a card, you have to 'tap' it (turn it sideways, as in Magic the Gathering). There's an untap mechanic but I can't remember what it is. Some cards are 'one of a kind' - you can only use/tap one of those at a time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417646/#Comment_417646" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-02T06:04:39+00:00" title="July  2, 2013  6:04AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SAGA System (Dragonlance Fifth Age and Marvel)<br/>TSR<br/>1996<br/><br/>This was a diceless heroic high fantasy game that was not AD+D, was thought to be very good, and which didn't win in the market place. I suspect that people seeing a fantasy card game wanted Magic the Gathering and were not satisfied that this wasn't that. (My guess I have no data to back up this notion).<br/><br/>The game comes with a deck of 80 unique fate cards divided into nine suits with number rankings. A player has a hand of cards that they play as they encounter challenges. The high number wins. The cards also included positive and negative states (I don't know what that means) and cues to aid role playing (info to help the GM narrate what happens). The number of cards in a player's hand sort of represents their hit points but since players can hold back their big cards till the end they are at their most deadly when they are nearest to death.

As JDCorley says it produces a back and forth action in which players try to best the other guys last move until you can't do it. Player play regular playing cards to do this. The wiki page doesn't say that they narrate as they do this but I imagine they must. <br/><br/>The game also uses a five act game structure that defines the bad guy as stronger early on and the good guys stronger later. The bad guy's plan can not be foiled before the fifth act.

Urges are associated with particular suits, and players may only choose to play against either Hubris or Ar\xeate. The goal is to match suit cards to appropriate traits, with face values being totaled to determine outcomes in conflict, highest numerical values indicating success. Thus a player has to not only draw for a numerical value greater than that of their opponent but also hope for properly matching suit cards, more or less.

It uses a tarot deck divided into minor/suit cards (used for challenge resolution) and major arcana (which each have special effects potentially unique to a campaign). Suit cards are dealt to players, with each suit representing some sphere of capability: strength or brute force (staves), agility or dexterity (swords), intellect or knowledge (coins), intuition or empathy (cups). Cards with higher numerical values beat lower-value cards in challenges. You may hold some cards in your hand and/or some face-up before you in your "trace" (which allows you to use them without discarding them, but tips everyone off as to what you can do). If you run out of cards in your hand, you may draw back up to 5 (minus however many are in your trace). If you draw an ace, you may draw from the major arcana. <br/><br/>Interestingly, "Psychosis is played with cards and only cards." Players aren't given character sheets and aren't allowed to take notes, really trying to drive home the "unreliability of memory" theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417659/#Comment_417659" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-02T08:55:46+00:00" title="July  2, 2013  8:55AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monkey: The Storytelling Game of the Journey to the West<br/>D101 Games<br/>2010<br/><br/>Here is the key information from link Peter game above. I only put it here incase this list last longer that the link does.<br/><br/>"At its most basic the system is as follows. The player draws a number of cards equal to his most relevant skill and chooses whether to go for a Yin (red card, active) or a Yang (black card, passive) action. Once chosen and modified this action hand is played with a bit of player narration (you get a free draw if your narration is particularly entertaining.) The Narrator then draws some cards for the opposing force or character in the same way. The winner succeeds in either completing the action or opposing the action. In combat (social, mental or physical same system) the winner gains a Strike against his opponent. Player characters and big bosses have 3 strikes, supporting characters 2 and extras 1. Once you run out of strikes you are out of action. Being Immortals this isn\u2019t much of an issue as you simply take some time to regain your strength. That\u2019s right a game system without death: doesn\u2019t that make all you multiple total party killers breathe a sigh of relief?"<br/><br/>So it sounds like a conflict resolution mechanic with narration followed by fortune in the middle (the cards) and then concluding narration.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417661/#Comment_417661" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-02T09:40:16+00:00" title="July  2, 2013  9:40AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpg/4478/a-strange-charm" rel="nofollow">A Strange Charm</a><br/>???

Each player would get one at the beginning of the game, and would play them at some point during the game when it would make the story more interesting (or make the PC's lives more difficult!). If the GM liked the use of the Whimsy Card, the player might get another one to replace the one she played. Use of Whimsy Cards is always subject to GM approval and/or modification."<br/><br/>Untitled<br/>Paulo Rivas<br/>2011<br/><br/>I ended using a slighty modified version of the Whimsy Cards to make a different unpublished/untitled game: you divide the whole deck among the players, choose any setting or genre you want, brainstorm one location for each player, a setting-destroying danger, three minor other possible problems and one hope. The game starts with the player who holds more cards, or roll the dice. <br/><br/>First player then uses one card and sets up a challenge to another player he chooses, using the phrase in the card and any of the previously brainstormed elements: dangers, locations, hope, etc. The player then explains what her character does and how it reacts. If he resisted she rolled dice, if succesful, the challenge was overcome and the First player keeps the card. If not, PC is still in trouble and the player who faced the challenge gets the card.<br/><br/>Turns continue clockwise around the table with players setting challenges and rolling to overcome them or just accepting the card. Next turn players get to use two cards, then three and so forth. They could use all in a single challenge or make more challenges to different players on her turn. No PC dies until the end of the game, though their problems can become more and more difficult. Some cards also help players get out of a challenge or give them a second chance at overcoming it.<br/><br/>Game ends when one player uses all her cards on its turn; her PC survives the whole deal and cards are re-shuffled for the epilogue. All players roll dice and draw that number of cards from the deck. Except for the winner, everybody rolls the dice to see if they survive and then everybody uses the cards to tell how it ended for her character.<br/><br/>In playtest it tends to produce nice stories when all players are more collaborative/story oriented and a total gonzo-fest when they get competitive and try to make fun of each other.

Each card can be played for some type of bonus (+3 damage) or story effect (you notice an overlooked clue!)  There's a bit of a pacing mechanic for how the cards can be played in combat.<br/>2 The deck was used to determine initiative, and mix it up a little bit with occasional extra effects for one side or the other (This turn, the villains act twice!)  The initiative card also determines an approved action.  Any player taking that action gets another card.  This encouraged mixing up what you were doing from round to round.<br/>3 The cards had a multi-step skill resolution system, that was imminently ignorable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417674/#Comment_417674" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-02T13:39:29+00:00" title="July  2, 2013  1:39PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just checked out the short order heroes web page.

A terrible and devastating ambush. ... A captured war-horse with a taste for human meat. ... The ghost of a tyrant king, strangled by his own daughter.<br/><br/>Players then choose characters inspired by these elements.  You could choose to be the king's ghost, the murderous daughter, or the exorcist priest called in to deal with the ghost (not directly drawn from any of the Oracle elements).<br/><br/>Players also choose where and when to set the story, based on the Oracle elements.

Most of the games use cards as a form fortune but the cards don't really contribute to the narration more than dice. The other games are the ones where the cards directly engage the narration  dating all the way back to Everway.<br/><br/>Interestingly the "I am zombie" game Mark Rein-Hagen has on Kickstarter definitely fits in the second category. <br/><br/>I wonder how close cards doing this connect to how traits add to narration?

He has a Pyromaniac card, which besides the traits of Explosives, Stealth and Rage, has unique advantages and disadvantages. He knows how to start a fire without leaving any evidence and how to combine household supplies to make combustibles. Very useful indeed. However, his disadvantages are that he absolutely loves to start fires obsessively, can\u2019t resist in fact, and that he always plays with fire, if only with his lighter.<br/><br/>So, Dr.Offenbach is passing down the street at night with his party and sees a school. What is that school special for? Thats right, fire safety protocol misconduct. What does he do? Sets the school on fire. Narrator can give him a chip, since he used his disadvantage to commit a major crime, but which also puts the whole crew at risk.<br/><br/>Dr.Offenbach got a Vengeance Chip (Crazy Dice) of a red Mayhem color. He can use it to turn one red botch, a 1, into a red success. Extremely useful thing, when you can turn a failure into a decent success. Chips can also be traded among players.

I think personally that if card creates a in-game-dilemma for the player, then it's someone else than just having to include the card in the narration. The three trends I can spot is if the card can be used as a response to the story, as something that drives the story or something that is included in the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417909/#Comment_417909" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-07T14:31:42+00:00" title="July  7, 2013  2:31PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just watched a video on character creation.

Spades focus on altering events in time, hearts on social interaction/manipulation, clubs on physical action, and diamonds on knowledge and learning. In general, higher cards are better, but some draws can have special meanings (e.g., Queen is "success at a cost," Joker is a critical failure that somehow leads to profit later, drawing out-of-suit but in-color counts as a success at a cost, etc.).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/albill" title="albill"><img alt="albill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/348/nL4YMQPY0H7JF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/albill">albill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419161/#Comment_419161" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T22:24:13+00:00" title="July 28, 2013 10:24PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Motobushido isn't out yet but I've run a playtest of it.

The better you are at something (based on classes you've taken, stuff you've practiced for homework, the dorm you live in, etc.), the more cards you draw when you attempt to do it. Your cards need to add up to at least 10 to succeed, and after that, every extra card is a "bang" that can be used to make your action even more successful (e.g., making spells last longer).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/darken" title="darken"><img alt="darken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/darken">darken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420405/#Comment_420405" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T06:42:19+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  6:42AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2013 7:06AM by darken.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://gindie.pl/sklep/przetrwaliscie-zaglade/" rel="nofollow">Przetrwaliscie Zaglade</a> (You survived Apocalypse)<br/>Jacek Golebiowski<br/>2013<br/><br/>It polish game about people that survived apocalypse.
