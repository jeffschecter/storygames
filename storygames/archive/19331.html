I'm Rafael! I started posting here about 8 years ago. I designed an RPG called <i>Pandemonio</i> (formerly released as two separate games -- <i>Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium</i> and <i>Spite: The Second Book of Pandemonium</i>), and a video-chat larp called <i>ViewScream</i>. I also made a dark sci-fi <i>Fiasco</i> playset called <i>The White Hole</i> (it's a lot of fun, you should play it).<br/><br/>I got a new thing in the oven. It's a bestiary for OSR games, and it's called <b>Lusus Naturae</b> (Latin for "freaks of nature"). It's pretty nasty!<br/><br/>For this monstrous manual, I'm delving into the myths of my Peruvian ancestors:<br/><br/>* Machukuna, the ancient ones who saw their doom when the Sun was created, and fled to deep waters (where they wait);<br/>* Sarara, a feathered horror summoned from the darkest pits of the underworld by foolhardy sorcerers;<br/>* Chuyanchaki, shapeshifters who always forget one important detail;<br/>* Supay, lord of death, who rules over all demons from his throne in Ukhupacha;<br/><br/>The project funded on day 3, and we're heading for the stretch goal of full-color illustration. If you like horror in your dungeon-crawling, and you're cool with old-school stats like hit points and armor class, then you'll want to check <b>Lusus Naturae</b> out!<br/><br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rafaelchandler/lusus-naturae-a-gruesome-old-school-bestiary" rel="nofollow">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rafaelchandler/lusus-naturae-a-gruesome-old-school-bestiary</a><br/><br/>Questions? Ask me. I like to chatter.<br/><br/>\\m/<br/><br/>-- Rafael                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
