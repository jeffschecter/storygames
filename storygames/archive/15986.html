Am I right in thinking that, under the current rules, if you only write a new Bond when you resolve an old one (and thus gain XP for it), then your number of total Bonds always remains static? I'm kind of pretty not into that. I'd be inclined to let each person write a new Bond if they have an idea for one at the end of each session, but you can never have more than three active Bonds with each other player (and in practice no one is ever going to be even close to their max).<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363907/#Comment_363907" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T12:21:29+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 12:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 12:38PM by mease19.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you get XP from bonds resolving, having a fairly static number keeps everyone on a pretty even keel.  <br/><br/>One thing I did recently was make a custom move that gave the player a bond with a monster as part of its negative effects.

Your net ability to aid/interfere is static, unless a move grants you a new Bond (I LOVE Marshall's idea), but how that's allocated changes. Maybe at one point you're better at aiding Thelian, at another point its Omar.<br/><br/>Adding a new Bond at the end of each session doesn't feed that cycle. Now getting XP means turning down an improved ability to help someone (since the resolved Bond won't count towards your aid/interfere, and since you still only gain one Bond per session). Invoking the simple resolve/replace cycle is now a choice between different rewards, so some people won't want to resolve Bonds. That's not our goal.<br/><br/>Could you expand on why you're not that into that cycle? I'm very into the ongoing play it creates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363933/#Comment_363933" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T13:01:03+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  1:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, what you propose is a completely valid custom move and if that's how you want to play, play like that.

Yeah, I don't know that's something we're designing towards. Part of that is the practical nature of Bonds as sentences: you get more than 5 or so and each one starts meaning less, they're harder to keep track of.<br/><br/>As it stands your ability to help any given person can always be shifting, but your overall ability is capped, which is to my liking. It has the effect of spotlighting player-to-player bonds, instead of an slow growth of overall bonding.<br/><br/>I'm working on the Hacking chapter for Beta 2 today, I may throw something about this in there, but I don't think the current mechanic will change for this particular reason.<br/><br/>One more thing to think about: if you always get a new Bond and have the option of resolving one as well (but you still one get one new Bond) then the optimal long-term strategy seems to me to be: don't resolve until you have three bonds with everyone, then start resolving one every session and replacing it. I'm sure there's a way to design around it, but that is not the goal of how Bonds are supposed to work. They're supposed to be shifting ties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364024/#Comment_364024" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T16:47:30+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  4:47PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For more discussion around these issues, see also: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15934&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">[DW] Confused by Bonds</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364040/#Comment_364040" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T17:37:08+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  5:37PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>One more thing to think about: if you always get a new Bond and have the option of resolving one as well (but you still one get one new Bond) then the optimal long-term strategy seems to me to be: don't resolve until you have three bonds with everyone, then start resolving one every session and replacing it.
