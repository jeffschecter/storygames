Immediately, he asked if he could play.  Mind you, he knows nothing about this game except that Daddy is borrowing it from Mr. Mazza.  After seeing the cover with the picture of the Kerrn, he's sold; he wants to play this game.<br/><br/>Now I'm feeling stuck.  Because I don't think that Isaac is ready for a game like Burning Empires.  He's eight, and I don't think that he has the necessary wherewithal for the game.  But I think that he *could*.  For a while, Crystal and I have agreed that we could totally see Isaac as a wargamer, and I think that the tactical crunchiness of Burning Empires (or Burning Wheel, for that matter) could be the the kind of thing that he would really get into.<br/><br/>So, here's my question.  What games would be good for me to use to bring Isaac down this path?  Should I just jump into Burning Wheel with him?  Are there other games that would be an easier start while still having that tactical crunch which I think he will enjoy?  Any thoughts?<br/><br/>I summon the power of Story Games.

Make World Burning a whole session, explaining about the backstory as each choice is made; also be sure to speak to what sorts of characters become (im)possible with each choice--this will Take Time. Ditto for character creation: you'll need that time, too! Then go straight into something simple: a Duel of Wits, maybe, or a one-on-one Firefight.

I would suggest trying games that have a good deal of narrative control with low handling time. My experience is the most difficult thing to convey is when they need to stop the narrative, so a game that requires a lot of stopping to roll dice can be frustrating for them I think. On the plus kids really seem to like being able to tell stories to / with adults.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140074/#Comment_140074" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T13:36:04+00:00" title="April 16, 2008  1:36PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey folks!<br/><br/>Just to be clear, this isn't Isaac's first roleplaying game. He already has a little bit of experience with the Pool from when he was around 6 or so. He also helped playtest my daughter's forthcoming game <i>Alien Smackdown</i>, which is exactly that "good deal of narrative control with low handling time" that Clyde talks about. In addition, he regularly plays the Lord of the Rings coop board game with a reasonable amount of intelligence. So this isn't his first entry into These Games of Ours.<br/><br/>Well, anyways, when I can carve out some time, we will sit down and do some world burning and character burning. If he's bored afterward...well, it wasn't for him (at least, not yet). But, I'm hoping not. This could be a Very Cool Experience.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140681/#Comment_140681" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T11:53:07+00:00" title="April 21, 2008 11:53AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By my experience with children (I am far from being a father myself, but I have tons of nephews and stuff) as long as you keep him involved and things are about stuff he likes, he won't get bored.<br/><br/>And even if he gets bored about something, you might switch to a different aspect of the game. That may give him some air and allow him to remain involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
