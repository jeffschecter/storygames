I entered, hoping to design my first full-fledge game, but failed to anticipate exactly how busy I was going to be that week.  Sadly, I never managed to get anywhere on the project beyond an initial pitch.  So, here I am, throwing out the idea to the Story Games board, looking for ideas and advice.  I've got a basic premise, but where should I go from here?  I'm still a busy person, but now that there's no pressure, perhaps I can actually make this into something fun.  Any thoughts, suggestions?  Read the pitch below:<br/><br/><b><i>Gossip!</i> The game of schoolyard espionage.<br/></b><br/>Spy on the girls, steal their secrets, and make sure they can't do the same to you!<br/><br/>Can you decipher the coded notes they've been passing in class? Why do they always go to washroom in pairs? What do those weird pseudo-English words really mean? And what really goes on at slumber parties?<br/><br/>Is one classmate being particularly annoying? It might be time to take them out with a water balloon barrage, or to destroy their credibility with a well-placed whoopie-cushion. Be careful of retribution, though; those girls can be real sly, and you never know when they'll strike back. You could be the target of bullies, out for you lunch money, or you could find yourself at the very wrong end of a dreaded <i>makeover</i>.<br/><br/>Don't let the teacher catch you; you've also got to maintain the pretence of being a straight-A student. It's hard to concentrate on your math homework when you're always looking over your shoulder.<br/><br/>-Mike                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196979/#Comment_196979" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-14T22:49:35+00:00" title="March 14, 2009 10:49PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fun.

That's when their story resolves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196994/#Comment_196994" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T06:10:37+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  6:10AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, there's this sweet advanced version of go fish called Fishing for Terrorists, you should check it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.
