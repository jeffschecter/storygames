It held up pretty well, there was some cracking roleplaying, but bits of it were wonky and need tweaking.<br/><br/>Dead Man Talking is an exploration, in extremis, of how a person ended up as they did. I used impending execution as the catalyst for this, following Dr Jonhson's famous dictum that when a man learns that he is to hang in the morning, \u201cit concentrates the mind wonderfully\u201d (Well, my English degree had to be useful for [i]something[/i]). This happened, but not entirely as I had predicted. The three players framed scenes from their past which (possibly) foreshadowed the future negative turn of events, the PCs comprising a contract killer, a woman who had killed her abusive husband, and a young man who had killed someone after reading Ayn Rand- almost as a philosophical exercise, as in the Hitchcock film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040746" rel="nofollow">Rope</a>.  <br/><br/>The scenes ended up being framed a little shakily, which was probably down to my less than precise explanation. That said, there was a lot of good material. There was a scene with the husband-killer and her grandmother (by whom she was raised, as her parents died when she was very young), where we saw that she was deprived of affection, which may have contributed to her ending up with an abusive husband in the first place. Then there was a scene where, immediately after the murder, the intellectual killer went to see his professor, who, we gathered, like the Jimmy Stewart character in Rope, had earlier talked airily about murder as a philosophical exercise. The professor, naturally, was appalled, as it was brought home to him very sharply that abstract ideas can have a potentially disastrous effect on an impressionable mind.<br/><br/>I think there were several problems with the game- or things to work on- that this playtest exposed: <br/><br/><b>Chronology</b> I'd divided the game into Phases, comprising childhood, early adulthood, crime and arrest, and last meal, which I intended to explore in reverse chronological order, the idea being that the players would, as they travelled back through their past, discover how they had become killers. It soon became clear though that each player framing scenes in that order imposed an unnatural restriction on the players, and therefore didn't quite work. Forex the intellectual killer, after the last meal Phase, combined the crime Phase with the early adulthood Phase. My feeling now is that this should be allowable, and moreover that each player should frame scenes in whatever order they choose, since every player is likely to see the events and their relative significance differently.  <br/><br/><b>NPCs</b> One of the players on their feedback form suggested the game should be GMful (my original idea was that it should be GMless), so that the GM could play NPCs, which is a fair point, but I think there was also the question of what role the NPCs should play. The current draft has players paying tokens to be in a scene, in addition to the protagonist inviting them, and to change various details about it, which now strikes me as wrong because the scenes in this game are very personal, so the protoganist should have a great deal of say in what happens in them.  One of the best moments in the game was when I had the warder walking the players the few yards from their cell to the execution chamber. One by one I asked each one how they carried themselves as they were led out of the cell (shuffling, reluctant, walking straight etc.), whether other prisoners reacted to them as they passed their cells, and- probably the moment of purest roleplaying of the whole game- what was going on in their heads in the last few seconds before they entered the chamber.  <br/> <br/><b>Interaction between PCs</b> This is something we didn't really do, but which I think should be explored in future playtests. Another player suggested there should be a scene when they first arrive at the prison. I'd ideally like to have a number of interstitial scenes, with one of the characters being in a certain place- library, exercise yard etc. (obviously, I'll have to do some research on this and other characteristics of a Death Row facility) and other players able to enter the scene and interact with the protagonist. For this, the token system would come into play, and this was another area that I think needs work, so let me explain that:<br/><br/><b>Tokens</b> Each player starts off with ten tokens, which they can spend to do three things: 1) add a minor detail, such as the weather- spend one token, 2) enter the scene- spend two tokens, and 2) make the scene more positive or more negative- spend two tokens. I still think adding details would work, but without having to spend tokens, and spending them to enter a scene I now think goes against the personal nature of the scene framing, although for the interstitial scenes I think they would be useful. However, we did employ the tone-altering mechanic, which works as follows: a player other than the protagonist spends two tokens, takes a d6 and rolls it. 1, 2 and 3 make the tone darker- the change being narrated by the dice-roller- while 2, 4 and 6 make it lighter, that change being narrated by the protagonist. The number on the die 1-6 gives you the severity or otherwise of the change. I like this mechanic and am keen to keep it, but I need to work out how to use it without depriving the protagonist of narrative control.  <br/><br/><b>Crime and arrest Phase</b> In the end, these scenes seemed a bit forced, and I\u2019m not sure how useful they are, but it may depend on the crime in question. One point about the description of the crime: I\u2019ve put in the rules preamble that the group should have a quick L&amp;V discussion prior to game start, particularly wrt the crime itself, but thinking about it- and I know this issue has been done to death on this and other forums- it\u2019s almost impossible to play this sort of game if individual players can veto the crimes. <br/><br/>Some more general comments:<br/><br/>1. I\u2019d advised in the rules that, apart from their physical appearance, players should keep the character sheet player-facing, but we soon ran into a problem when we realised we needed to reveal our names. And then we wondered whether some sections of the character sheet could be eliminated entirely. I\u2019m generally of the opinion that the character sheet provides the player with hooks which they can use or not, as they choose, so I\u2019ll probably leave everything in, but one thing I\u2019m very clear on is that the descriptions should be minimal, either one or two words or a phrase or short concept cue. <br/><br/>2. Should there be advice in the book on what kinds of characters to create? One of the players thought in retrospect that his character didn\u2019t make for as good a story as the other two, and, while I disagree- I think it was just as valid as the others, and just as amenable to exploration- I take the point that some crimes and characters would seem to be a better fit for this game than others, so what do folks think? Would some guidelines be helpful? While I\u2019m extremely loth to put in the rules of any game book proscriptive-sounding passages, I don't have a problem with guidance.<br/><br/>3. I\u2019d put on the character sheet a section for the players to briefly describe what they think tipped them over the edge into killing i.e. was there a single moment or trigger event? The players thought it likely that most killings would be the result of a long-term build-up of resentment, frustration or rage. I still think that at least some murders might have a trigger event, and that it\u2019s probably leaving that section in the character sheet for the time being, until a consensus is reached one way or the other. <br/><br/>4. OOC chat about the characters? I\u2019m a big fan of dropping out of game at various points in order for the players to examine the behaviour of the characters dispassionately. We didn\u2019t do that in this playtest, but I\u2019d like to do it in the next one, just to see what happens.<br/><br/>It\u2019d be great if folks could run their own playtests- I think the game is straightforward enough that it can go directly to beta playtesting without passing Go and collecting \xa3200 (or however much it is nowadays) so please, go ahead- knock yourselves out <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>!

Ref the PC interaction where did it take place? On Death Row they could have player facing cells if set in 1800's London the condemned were all in the same cell</i><br/>Yeah, the feedback was tremendously helpful. As a result of it I'm going to make some major changes. Forex, I now think the main scene-framing should be what I had previously thought would be filler scenes, i.e. PC interactions within the prison. That way you can have NPCs in the scene legitimately, without compromising on the players' narrative authority, and the token system would come into its own, with players seeing an interesting scene develop, and paying to be in it. Plus, the game could have mods for different locations and periods of history, such as the ones you mention. <br/><br/>The scenes I'd had as main Phases (Childhood, Early adulthood etc.) could then be for single-player monologues: once per turn, each player could call for a scene, and relate some story from their life, choosing from all the different periods of it. The chronology would be what you suggest, to whit a slow march to the final scene, during which tensions would build and players' inner fears and hopes etc. be exposed.<br/><br/><i>Anyway sounds like your onto something there</i><br/>I do think it's got legs. As I mentioned before, the initial idea was suggested by a gamer buddy. I played around with it a bit, then got all enthusiastic and wrote the first draft one evening, and now, after this first playtest, I'm really fired up about it.<br/><br/><i>As for the tokens they sound a bit abstract.... Make them trade cigarettes ;-)</i><br/><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/Cigarettes.pdf" rel="nofollow">Done!</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430361/#Comment_430361" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T17:11:32+00:00" title="March 31, 2014  5:11PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Different historical periods == awesome idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430394/#Comment_430394" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T13:54:19+00:00" title="April  1, 2014  1:54PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Different historical periods == awesome idea.</blockquote>\nAgree.

If they spend five tokens, say, they can roll a d20, and if they get 15 or under they walk. Their Epilogue would then involve seeing how they turned out afterwards: do they return to crime, turn  over a new leaf etc.?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430568/#Comment_430568" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-05T18:01:46+00:00" title="April  5, 2014  6:01PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2014 6:03PM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love the pardon idea but personally, I'm less convinced about the die roll.  Are you saying you (the player) can influence the die roll based on the number of tokens spent?  That's certainly better than being arbitrary.  But what if somehow the other players' judgments (of your situation) might come into play?<br/><br/>Note this wouldn't necessarily be a simple matter of whether or not they feel you "deserved" it because they think you "innocent" - plenty of innocents get put to death, and plenty of guilty people get pardoned.  I think this has more to do with "dramatic justice" or even "epic tragedy" than guilt or innocence <i>per se.</i> <br/><br/>Of course, it's not my game so it's easy for me to just tawk and tawk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430569/#Comment_430569" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-05T18:26:02+00:00" title="April  5, 2014  6:26PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2014 6:28PM by catty_big.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just obsessed with tokens <img alt=":s" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confounded.png" title=":s"/> It may not work of course, only further playtesting will really prove that. But how about saying a player can roll for <i>another </i>player to be pardoned? That way, you can have Player A rolling for Player B, where Player B might think themselves guilty and actually <i>deserving </i>of the punishment. They would then, after a successful roll, have to choose whether to take the pardon or not. Not true to real world justice systems, obviously, but it could be an interesting in-game proposition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430583/#Comment_430583" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-06T13:49:05+00:00" title="April  6, 2014  1:49PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I've just realised you're suggesting I should enable the players to get a pardon just by spending tokens, not having to roll a die as well.
