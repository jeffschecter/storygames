What are the structures already in place to help people construct a satisfying story experience out of live acting and action, in a more structure format that improv may be able to provide?  <br/><br/>It's no secret that I'm asking because I got to play several <a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/" rel="nofollow">Jeep Form</a> games at Ropecon, and I'm looking to encompass other related forms as I learn about how to write interactive narrative fiction, you know, frickin' role playing games that way, too. <br/><br/>So, as I look at this massive index of types of games, I'm wondering if there are any insightful and focussed sites or discussions where people have done the same kind of inquiry, that can be a starting point.  Clearly, the jeep page is one. Are there others? If not, how do you folks who have done or currently do improv choose exercises and techniques for your sessions?  What kind of structures have you found satisfying to provide coherent narrative?  I've talked to at least a couple folks about this already. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>yrs,<br/>Em<br/><br/>cross-posted with Majcher.

It's one of those subjects, like LARPs, where people  say How It Is Done, when they mean How Their School Of Improv Does It.<br/><br/>Like Marc, I come from the Keith Johnstone school, so I'll say...<br/><br/>Ignore the games. They won't tell you anything. <br/><br/>There's various techniques that might be useful, though. For example:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Yes, And...</b>: The idea that you should build on what the other person gives you. If you diminish what the other person says (e.g. they say "You're blinded" and you say "But only for a moment"), that's bad. Always heighten.</li>\n<li><b>Status</b>: Status differences lead to interesting scenes. If I play a high-status shop owner (relaxed, direct, sure of himself) and you play a low-status customer (nervy, checking himself), the scene will be much different from if I play a low-status shop owner and you play a high-status customer. And then there's all sorts of tricks with reversing status, changing status, etc.</li>\n<li><b>Reincorporation</b>: If, at the start of the story, we establish you've got a mysterious key in your pocket, it's <i>really impressive</i> if that key is used to open a door at the end of the story</li>\n</ul>\nAs I remember, there's not really a good place on the web to learn about this stuff. Try reading Impro by Keith Johnstone. It's great. Better still, take an improv course. You'll love it.<br/><br/>Like I say, that's a Keith Johnstone view of improv. There's also the Del Close school of improv, which is all about finding the game within the scene, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90170/#Comment_90170" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T12:37:12+00:00" title="August 24, 2007 12:37PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chicago-style improv is terrible at telling stories.

Am I just not Jedi enough?</blockquote>\nWe have this huge discussion on our local improv group boards every few months. Austin is in a neat place, improv-wise, because we have a strong base of Johnstonians, influenced heavily by some killer Chicago-style people, and it's all been incorporated into this wonderful mashup of everything. Naturally, a friendly snark about the Harold or somesuch will spark off a lively debate about the two styles, and it almost always comes back to this: Both of the two main schools of improv are aiming at the same goal, they just get there by different paths. When you see the best players from either side operating at the top of their game, the product can sometimes be indistinguishable - it's just great theater, which happens to be funny along the way. The fact that you come up through the schools in one way or another, concentrating on narrative forms, or thematic ones, or going through a prescribed set of class levels or making your own way, all that doesn't matter. Like Remi said, once you've got the basics down, it's all a matter of style from there - the schools aren't all that different, in the end.<br/><br/>Graham gives some great examples up there - "yes, and", reincorporation, playing with status, and finding the game in the scene are all pretty essential. But the games - so, here's the thing about improv games: most of them suck. Some of them are great for quick gags and easy laughs, but they lack re-playability, and are essentially empty and meaningless. Many short-form games evolved out of other exercises, and they get a laugh, and they get stuck. <b>Good</b> improv games are priceless, because they not only look good on stage, but they teach valuable lessons to beginning improvisers. If you read interviews with Johnstone in the last while or so, you'll see his utter frustration with the state of things in that regard. These games were originally developed to <i>solve problems</i> that they were actually coming across in rehearsals and performances, and many of them have been twisted or neutered to suck those lessons out of them. You'll find some good examples of these in the Impro books, but if you're just looking at a big list, yeah, it's hard to tell what's worthwhile, and why.

Alternately, you just take whatever choices your character makes in the first few moments of the scene - that's <i>who you are</i>, and you hang on to that character like grim death ("sticking to your shit", as they say), and play with the game that arises from the chemistry between them and the others in the scene. <br/><br/>How you "play the game" really depends on how long your scene is, and what kind of scene you're shooting for. If you're doing 1-2 minute bits in a montage, you jump on that game and ride it hard. If you're playing longer scenes, or more grounded ones, you obviously want to draw it out more, and not heighten as ridiculously as you might otherwise - chew on it a little bit, roll it around some, then put it away for a little while while you work on character or environment building, or a different game, and then when you bring it back out and ride it a little more, that's when some magic happens.<br/><br/>You're right, though - it's a hard thing to get across in words, and sometimes it takes a really good teacher to draw it out for you. And practice. Lots of practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90216/#Comment_90216" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T13:57:13+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  1:57PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Emily,<br/><br/>I want to second the recommendation for the first part of the HGWT interview with Remi, because it focuses on parts of improv that <b>don't</b> carry over very well. Given the recent excitement we've seen in this community over potential applications for improv techniques, it's a refreshing conversation about the limitations of improv as a storytelling system.<br/><br/>I'm another Johnstonian-school improviser (mostly through <a href="http://www.improv.org" rel="nofollow">BATS in San Francisco</a>), so I also agree with Graham's big 3, and highly recommend you read <b>Impro</b>.<br/><br/>As a slight tangent, you may want to investigate the Commedia dell Arte, which is a precursor to modern improv. It has a much more rigid structure (archetypal characters in largely fixed relationships following loose plots with definite beginnings/middles/ends), which you may find easier to build rules around. Plus, you can't go wrong with a Harlequin.<br/><br/>As one of my instructors put it, mastering improv is like eating an elephant with a spoon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90304/#Comment_90304" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T20:17:16+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  8:17PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, Graham, this is not too much.

Some of them are great for quick gags and easy laughs, but they lack re-playability, and are essentially empty and meaningless. Many short-form games evolved out of other exercises, and they get a laugh, and they get stuck. Good improv games are priceless, because they not only look good on stage, but they teach valuable lessons to beginning improvisers.</i><br/><br/>Okay, so how do you get beyond this? What is the goal of improv beyond honing your skills and getting a laugh? How do you reach those heights?<br/><br/><i>When you see the best players from either side operating at the top of their game, the product can sometimes be indistinguishable - it's just great theater, which happens to be funny along the way.</i><br/><br/>Is the path to there really just experience?

It's all too much to talk about here: you get the techniques, but not the background.<br/><br/>On structure: it's rather a double-edged sword. It can squeeze stories into the shape you want, but it can stop the story spinning off in an exciting, spontaneous direction.<br/><br/>Our local impro group, The Spontaneity Shop, uses a set structure on their romantic comedy format, Dreamdate. Romantic comedy works well with a rigid structure (boy meets girl, they get along great, there's a problem, they nearly split up, they have an exciting reunion, usually at an airport). They don't use a structure with other stuff.<br/><br/>(Note: when I say "structure is rather a double-edged sword", I'm using Great British Understatement. What I actually mean is: structure is a bad place to start thinking about improv. Oh, depending what you mean by structure. Aaaargh.

Beyond building a skill and putting on a good show, benefits of improv become more personal. Or perhaps you mean, how do you take improvisational theater beyond quick laughs. To the best of my understanding, the answer to that is "a company of actors that trust each other, and an intention set before the performance to try and create a certain type of atmosphere."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91276/#Comment_91276" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T07:13:52+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  7:13AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am loving these threads, and I almost missed this one.

By bringing back your Large, Excellent Coat in a Dogs game you reinforce the importance of that item in the story.<br/><br/>However, I agree that this isn't quite the reincorporation you see in improv. The important thing about improvisational reincorporation is that you're usually recontextualizing whatever it is you're reincorporating. Sometimes this is short-term, such as bringing back a stated belief from earlier in the scene and juxtaposing it with the changes in circumstance that have come about through the scene. Sometimes this is long term, such as reintroducing a character from earlier in the show into a later, different scene. In both you're reincorporating in order to say something about the scene and/or about the thing reincorporated.<br/><br/>This is not always the case with items on a character sheet. You sometimes use the Coat if it's just a handy way to say you have authority, and can use it in this way without ever reflecting on the situation or the item. It's really fun when you use an item in Dogs and it becomes more important, or something is revealed about it or the person using it. Sometimes a gun is a gun, and a belief is a belief, and using them in the game doesn't say much more than that. To go further, I used the same battle axe for almost a year in a D&amp;D campaign (modifying/powering it up as I went along) and it never gained meaning or weight, it was just a battleaxe. Just reusing something doesn't mean you're reincorporating it in the sense we're talking about.<br/><br/>It occurs to me it is easier to reincorporate people, as people are defined by their reactions to a situation, whereas some effort has to be made to imbue an object with meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91526/#Comment_91526" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T04:29:18+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  4:29AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Recontextualization is key.
