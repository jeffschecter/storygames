And if you squint at it, it looks like Europe and Africa.  I've heard people say they think the setting is really creative, so I was surprised that it looked like a cliched Not-Europe.<br/><br/>So, during a break in the game, I went in closer to take a better look.  There's different bubbles pointing at different areas, with a name and quick synopsis.<br/><br/>I had a good laugh looking at the top half of the map.  Scandinavia is huge, because clearly Scandinavia is METAL, and there's a country of viking dwarf dragonslayers or something, which is pretty awesome, and a Transylvania/Ravenloft analogue, and something that looks like Grimdark France, and Romantic Spain in the middle of Europe, and Italy's been taken and put off of Scandinavia, and to the east there's some steampunk barbarian land, which is the only thing that seemed at all imaginative (but could possibly also be an analog for Czar Peter brings western technology to Russia).<br/>Anyway, it looked a little interesting.  Still obviously Not-Europe, but maybe if it was rotated like 90 degrees, the comparison wouldn't be so obvious.<br/><br/>Then I looked at Not-Africa, and it wasn't funny anymore.<br/><br/>There's seven civilizations in with text bubbles on the bottom half of the map.  In the northeastern part of Not-Africa, we have \u201cOsirion,\u201d which is land of Pharoahs and Pyramids and clearly Not-Egypt.  The Nile is clearly on the map.  To the east, we have a Not-Arabia nation.  These are direct historical analogues, much clearer and obvious than the ones in Europe which seemed to involve at least some imagination at first glance.<br/><br/>There's a nasty looking North-Not-African Nation, and an empire of (white) Liches on the East Coast.  But mostly I am concerned about the three featured South Not-Saharan nations.<br/><br/>One is on the west coast, and is a haven for pirates.<br/>One is in central Not-Africa, and is an empire of Talking Apes.<br/>One is in central Not-Africa, and is a war torn land of Gnolls.<br/><br/>I don't care much for words like cultural appropriation or political correctness, but it seems to me that if you're doing stuff with other people's cultural heritage, you should try to honor them.<br/><br/>Thus, especially in the context of centuries of institutionalized abuse of Afrcian peoples by European ones, it seems particularly problematic that the people of central Africa (and therefore Black People in general) are depicted as either Pirates, Talking Apes, or Gnolls.<br/><br/>This is incredibly racist.<br/><br/>It's possible, I suppose that the setting isn't actually that racist.  Maybe there's also really cool and empowering kingdoms peopled by Blacks.  (I understand one of the iconic characters is a fully-clothed female black paladin, for which I thank Paizo.)  But those nations either aren't on the map, or don't make enough of an impression compared to blatant stereotypes.  Sure, Kingdom of the Apes is a classic Pulp Trope, but it features so prominently amongst an already cliched depiction of Africa.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong and there's more to Pathfrinder's setting than this.  But if I am, then Paizo is doing itself a disservice by presenting it in this way.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418411/#Comment_418411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T07:20:23+00:00" title="July 16, 2013  7:20AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2013 7:20AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That certainly looks bad, I'm curious if there's any way it's an unfortunate coincidence.

Myself, I'd bet on this being simply the kind of fantasy world that seems fun, powerful or beautiful to the creators. There'd need to be a clear profit-motivation of some sort for racism to be intentional in something a hobby company like that makes. (Even if a single secret racist were in an influential position in the company, one would presume that they couldn't make very sweeping choices about their direction without justifying their strategy on economic or artistic terms.)<br/><br/>As for Willow's question, I don't find an ethical wrong in what I know of that setting. It's aesthetically insipid and boring by my measure, but that has little to do with how it treats race or whatnot, and very much to do with the kind of fictional content and type of fiction 3rd edition encourages in the first place, so it's not that surprising.<br/><br/>In the spirit of answering the train of thought in the OP, I should clarify that although I don't see an ethical wrong here, I do see a racist setting: Golarion seems to be a pretty ordinary member in the historical train of commercial D&amp;D settings, and they're all (or lets say, I can't think of a counter-example right now) powerfully racist. That's just the type of fantasy that's sold under the D&amp;D brand, they're worlds of color-coded monstrous humanoids. I imagine that most people take this phenomenon in the spirit of counter-factual speculation that speculative fiction relies on: a writer telling about a world where racism is true, good, and a powerful political force is telling a fantasy story, rather than commenting upon our world. Few assume that the D&amp;D teaching about where evil is to be found and how it should be dealt with is intended to be applied to the real world.<br/><br/>One might ponder whether a racist setting hewing more or less close to the real world, as Golarion seems to be, is in ethical error when it implies untrue things about the real world. I'd argue that although such might cause accidental harm (e.g. reaffirm real-world stereotypes among the particularly vapid), it could not be considered an ethical wrong because freedom of expression is so much more important than protecting people from reading wrongful ideas. Were one to judge otherwise, it'd mean an undue burden of responsibility for anybody publishing anything that somebody somewhere could interpret for evil. Ultimately we have to accept that the audience has the ethical responsibility for their own ideas, even if they got them while reading something that was not attempting to argue for that idea.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the (seemingly far-fetched) KKK hypothesis were to hold true, and Paizo were actually intentionally drawing real-world parallels for e.g. ideological or economic reasons (that is, they'd either want to educate people to be racist, or they'd want to conquer market-share among a racist demographic), then that would surely be an ethical wrong; they would be spreading harmful lies (as I understand the nature of our world, anyway).<br/><br/>The balance of probability being what it is, I'm willing to say that Golarion doesn't seem to be any more ethically problematic than D&amp;D in general, or any counter-factual literature. Aesthetically problematic, that I'll agree to. Also, were one to forward some sort of positive discrimination argument, that would presumably require its own treatment - as far as I understand, the ethical justification of positive discrimination relies heavily on local political conditions, so I can't comment upon that in the abstract.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418423/#Comment_418423" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T08:38:15+00:00" title="July 16, 2013  8:38AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2013 8:38AM by Ben_Lehman.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is The Pathfinder Setting Ethically Problematic?</blockquote>\nyes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418435/#Comment_418435" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T09:55:00+00:00" title="July 16, 2013  9:55AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2013 9:55AM by Andy.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were to guess, I'd wager:<br/><br/>There's adventure lines and campaign seeds in print for all the European-analogue areas (and the pirate one; I know, I have the Pawn Set). Those settings are rich and detailed. Material "problematic" and "not problematic", with real efforts taken to make it not quite so (the NPC Pawns set I reviewed before - <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18580/pathfinder-npc-codex-awesome-minis-for-13th-age-other-fantasy-games-with-tactics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18580/pathfinder-npc-codex-awesome-minis-for-13th-age-other-fantasy-games-with-tactics</a> - have some non-white pieces, but a very even female/male split without tons of gratuitous cheesecake on the female side at the exclusion of the males, etc; they rock). <br/><br/>Then, someone had an idea to create a map as a promotional item. In the process, they had the idea to mark Areas of Adventure/Written Material with little character sketches and descriptions. <br/><br/>Then they got to Africa, and it was a big open blank save maybe 1-2 areas (and that pirate area, which was well defined). So they kinda grasp at straws, perhaps, pulling in side material, in order to fill in that section of the map to not appear to have a giant open blank area with Nothing (which, too, would have likely come off as offensive; "Nope, nothing worth adventurin' over in Fantasy Africa, nosiree..."). In the push to add existing character sketches and descriptions to Fantasy Africa, perhaps it was not noticed what the fill-ins amounted to.<br/><br/>That's my wild guess narrative based completely on conjecture, about how a company run by one of the most successful women in gaming (Lisa Stevens*), who consistently Get Things Right in relation to gender and race in our hobby crammed with schlock mostly-Euro action fantasy, might fumble here or there.

The more pertinent question is whether any given portrayal or depiction of 1923 is in itself problematic - ie. does it reify and glorify the problems, or does it interrogate them? If it interrogates them, does it attempt to put cracks in our master narratives of the past and of the present?<br/><br/>Since the Pathfinder setting isn't based in real life, it had the opportunity to omit racist analogs for black people.

If you're making a pseudo-Africa setting populated by analogs of fantastical beings from various African mythologies (Anansi, Maasai guardian spirits, etc.), that sounds kind of neat, especially after so many games with pseudo-European dwarves and elves and faeries. If, however, you're making a pseudo-Africa setting based on the racist caricatures and tall tales of that culture as imagined by oppressive colonists from foreign nations ... yeah, that's how forum threads like this get started.<br/><br/>The question of whether it's inherently problematic to play a game in a fantastical 1923 is an interesting one, but I think it's tangential to this issue. Do we have a responsibility to portray the bad with the good when we draw on the pop culture of a problematic period in time? My gut says no, but I'm open to being convinced otherwise. I really appreciated when Danger Patrol reassured me that we can enjoy the whiz-bang action of retro pulp adventure without wrestling with the racism, sexism, and imperialism because I think there's genuinely fun and innocent stuff in there that can be celebrated on its own merits. That said, some other elements of the past (like the glamor and style of the Mad Men-era ad industry) feel weirder to me to glorify without consideration of broader contexts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418455/#Comment_418455" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T12:15:15+00:00" title="July 16, 2013 12:15PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2013 12:19PM by catty_big.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you're trolling dude, these issues need to be aired.

Sometimes the allegory or commentary is more obvious than others, but even as the fantastical is used as a distancing technique, that's often so that we can approach real-world issues in a more abstract way, getting past our knee-jerk defenses and default assumptions. EDIT: Here are a <a href="http://www.fantasylit.com/fantasy-is-not-escapist-literature/" rel="nofollow">couple</a> <a href="http://futurismic.com/2010/11/23/science-science-fiction-and-the-real-world-some-perspectives/" rel="nofollow">links</a> that explain this better than I do. From that first link: "To quote Lloyd Alexander: 'Fantasy is hardly an escape from reality. It is a way to understand it.'"<br/><br/>So, yeah, the more I think about this, the more I think I might be getting a sense of why the "stories in 1923" comparison might not be as tangential as I originally thought. That setting and Pathfinder's setting both draw on potentially problematic aspects of pop culture from our own world's history. And, as I mentioned above, I don't think it's inherently problematic to do a game that draws upon the culture of a problematic era (because aren't they all problematic?). I <i>do</i> think it's a problem, however, to draw on obviously hurtful and offensive cultural elements in a celebratory manner, without rethinking it for a modern audience. It sounds to me like Pathfinder might be borrowing the more problematic aspects of pop culture from history in populating its pseudo-Africa, while there are definitely other things they could have drawn upon here (again, said the guy who doesn't play Pathfinder).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418458/#Comment_418458" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T12:26:30+00:00" title="July 16, 2013 12:26PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2013 12:28PM by catty_big.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>A good rule of thumb in evaluating this question for fantasy settings might be: <i>Whose mythology</i> are your fantasy peoples based upon?

Everything's cool as long as you can call out someone else as a victim, no matter the facts.<br/><br/>Corley puts his finger straight on something that evokes interesting responses in that 1923 America brings folks out to say, "Well, as long as you only say good things about black people and avoid anything contentious, it's cool." No one wants to take a piece into consideration on it's own basis. Hell, a setting that took all the racist stereotypes and played them straight could (and would, inadvertently) say some very interesting things in it's own idiom.<br/><br/>But we should avoid the "icky."

While I know that Judd goes Ape for talking hominids... and many a comic book reader LOVE 'em... it does have problem passing the sniff test.  Africans have been demonized and made into sub humans in pop culture for centuries (SHE, Tarzan etc) and if there is some kind of correlation between Talking Apes and RW ethnicities... that is really kinda awful.<br/><br/>But going right back to pop culture, Empires of Talking Apes aren't exactly a new thought... I know that I illustrated something like that for Bad Egg.  And look at Gorilla Grodd (a villain to his own peoples) in DC comics.  Done right, this could be a really pulpy, fun, exciting adventure place to be had... or even strong backgrounds for a PC or two.  But that is the rub, it has to be done right.  Devil is really in the details on this one.  Until I know more about Talking Gorilla Empire in Pathfinder's dark jungle region... I have to give them some benefit of the doubt, while upping my vigilance on the situation.<br/><br/>Anyone have any text on the area?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418469/#Comment_418469" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T13:46:34+00:00" title="July 16, 2013  1:46PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If people want to re-focus back on Pathfinder, that's cool, I'll put my thoughts in a new thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418470/#Comment_418470" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T13:56:43+00:00" title="July 16, 2013  1:56PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If people want to re-focus back on Pathfinder, that's cool, I'll put my thoughts in a new thread.</blockquote>\nYeah, I have to admit, we kind of veered away from the original question and started discussing this more in the abstract.

I couldn't and wouldn't dare to claim that another person was imagining a baseless parallel, when I knew perfectly well myself how deep the similarity was.<br/><br/>I actually have that same exact situation on my plate with my own design project right now; my fantasy world bears very specific similarities to a politically weighty parallel in the real world. Thing is, I don't want this resemblance to be perceived, at least from superficial observation, because that would cause the audience to automatically misinterpret my theme. What I do to deal with it is that I change the geography, nomenclature and other particulars sufficiently to be able to present the material as fresh and value-neutral even to people who are familiar with the real-world parallel.<br/><br/>Clearly this sort of process has not been attempted with Golarion. I suspect that Carsten is in something of a minority in claiming that there is no thematic parallel to Africa in Garund, as at least to me it's blindingly obvious: the ethnic markers, clothing, nomenclature, general sweep of the set-up are all stereotypically exoticized African, as viewed from an European viewpoint. It is not an accident that Garundian names seem to use similar transliterations (and presumably pronouncement) as is used for Zulu and other sub-Saharan languages particularly familiar to the British Empire.<br/><br/>Fantasy literature can distance itself from the real world to various degrees, and this will have different artistic effects with the audience. Golarion seems to me like its distance from historical Europe is about the same as my own D&amp;D campaign was last year: change the geography around, play fast and loose with the names, but don't particularly attempt to discourage parallels. I was maybe a pinch more open about the parallels in my own campaign, as I often broke the illusion and explicitly drew on historical events and personages and so on for inspiration, but the basic narrative conceit is the same: a setting where you may largely assume European parallels, and where everything that is fun about real-world history and culture has a place, but where we do not feel bound by any particular trivial detail.<br/><br/>Of course all this could be seen in an entirely different light by somebody who is not familiar with European history at all. I wonder if we could get our hands on some Chinese teenager Pathfinder fan, I'd be interested in hearing what the setting looks like to them <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418504/#Comment_418504" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T05:20:51+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  5:20AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite frankly, I'm surprised anyone would seriously argue that a fictional landmass with an Egypt analogue at the top and an Arabia analogue nearby and situated in an Africa-esque location on the map is somehow not intended to be a shorthand version of Africa. <br/><br/>No problem having a nation of apemen, and I reckon there'd be no controversy if they were located in not-France for example, as, as far as I know, French people are not subject to slurs comparing them to apes.

Neanderthals, now that'd make sense in France.<br/><br/>Myself, I wouldn't expect apes-in-Africa (even intelligent ones) to be a hidden racial slur <i>unless</i> that same picture of Africa presented a suspicious shortage of indigenous human population. Having humans and gorillas side by side, that's just an interesting set-up that parallels what must have been real pre-history for African people: living side by side with another hominid species of strange "forest people". (Of course all this is rather less pronounced in the D&amp;D kitchen-sink context; I imagine there's nobody in Golarion who doesn't live side-by-side with orcs, for example.)<br/><br/>I don't get the impression that Pathfinder marginalizes native African humans in an effort to imply that the apes are a stand-in for e.g. Mid-African Guinean tribes, but who knows - we'd have to ask the writers to find out what they tried to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418509/#Comment_418509" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T06:22:03+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  6:22AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>but a counter-point on the apes-in-Africa thing: gorillas and chimpanzees are <i>native</i> to Africa, so I have to say that if I were doing a pseudo-historical adventure story, that would be where I'd put the secret-intelligent-gorilla headquarters.</blockquote>\nThe history here is that racist whites in America have a long tradition of representing black people in cartoons and the like as monkeys and apes.

That's why I said 'icky' and not 'horrible', i can see what they are doing, but it comes across as cringeworthy. Sure, there are layers and reasons nuances at work in the setting, but the promotional material doesn't portray that, it shows monkey-men in africa. Presentation is everything.<br/><br/>And once again I didn't say all stories and settings should avoid all mention of racism or sexism or bigotry, just treat it respectfully and be careful about baking negative cultural artifacts directly into the setting. <br/><br/>Bioshock Infinite is a pretty good example of doing this right; the game's fantasy setting is very, very, racist and it makes a very good story. <br/><br/>For pure fantasy look at the Witcher; elves are discriminated against, and when you get the chance to help some out the story throws it in your face; the elves kill a bunch of innocent people. I was shocked! Most stories show the targets of racism as pure sad victims... and here the victims were JUST AS BAD (or at least, years of abuse have driven them to lash out). EDIT: on the other hand, the Witcher treated female characters absurdly sexually, and THAT bothered me.

Holding people accountable for their actions helps them from failing again in the future.<br/><br/>Fighting oppression is more important than helping a games-related company stay afloat. Conveniently it's not an either-or situation. Addressing racefail helps a company succeed, moving forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rishi" title="Rishi"><img alt="Rishi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/984/nSZ75WE644503.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rishi">Rishi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418551/#Comment_418551" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T13:11:03+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  1:11PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What bothers me most is that Paizo is a fairly big company and they have many, many people working on their products. I'm not privy to the inner workings of the company but I'm sure there's a lot of "design by committee" - where no single person is responsible for anything. So, many sets of eyes saw this before it went out. And a group of people either 1) never asked the question whether this could be racially insensitive or 2) asked the question and came to the conclusion that it was no big deal.<br/><br/>I hear the people who say that the poster is a poor representation for the setting, but I'd be surprised if it was just one person in the marketing department who created the poster. And the point of marketing materials is to grab the attention of someone unfamiliar with the product.<br/><br/>I often have people disagree with me on this point, but I do think that Paizo and Wizards need to be particularly sensitive to these kinds of issues as their games are often the introduction for most people to the RPG hobby. First impressions are important.<br/><br/>But, as others have said, Paizo has been responsive to criticism in the past and they'll hopefully be more cognizant of these issues in future releases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418578/#Comment_418578" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T17:46:49+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  5:46PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Problematic != The Devil</blockquote>\nYes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418591/#Comment_418591" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-18T01:27:02+00:00" title="July 18, 2013  1:27AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Problematic != The Devil</blockquote>\nYes.</blockquote>\nNot sure I understand either of these posts.

It's a blind spot, in other words, one I've certainly demonstrated in my time, and will likely continue to do so from time to time despite my best efforts.  Assuming the privileged demographic makes up the majority of Paizo internal stakeholders or creative decision-makers, it seems clear they built a pastiche without the requisite sensitivity in place to alert them of the racist implications.  Alongside that lack of awareness, the well-trod pulp trope of an intelligent ape civilization probably seemed to fit pseudo-Africa as a "logical" homeland.  I don't find intelligent frogs as dramatically compelling, but why not put intelligent apes elsewhere?  If humans can migrate across continents, so can apes.

Yes. It doesn't show the wealth of human culture and civilisation and cool stuff that Pathfinder's Africa analogue does have, and that is a disservice to fans, creators and potential consumers.<br/>Is the Pathfinder setting? Honestly I don't think so.<br/><br/>Depiction of African human culture within Garund (The Not!Africa) analogue runs from nomadic tribes to big cities, and across the spectrum from good to evil. With no correlation between them, in fact nicely and very explicitly avoiding both 'nomads are savages' and 'noble savage' stereotypes quite well. The city-dwelling cultures manage to avoid being 'we replicated a European culture but put black people in it, because black people never had big civilisations' which is another common trope I see, despite being inherently false, instead taking a lot of inspiration from the Sahelian Kingdoms with some fun twists thrown in.<br/>And they managed to do it all without exoticism too.<br/><br/>So sometimes, I see a bunch of Hyaena-men and some intelligent apes, and I think that maybe, they are Hyaena-men and intelligent apes rather than racist analogues. It has been brought up quite a bit that 'intelligent apes were previously used as promotion of a racist agenda when regarding this topic', which is true, but I don't think that necessarily makes the inherent presence of apemen in Africa cringeworthy or problematic when they are placed in there alongside all this dazzling array of human culture that clearly no parallels were intended or could indeed even be seen if you hadn't viewed the poster first. (If anything, I might be seen to argue that it is actually a post-racist reclamation of the idea without the icky subtext, because intelligent apes are cool. The society in which they live certainly has no direct analogue)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jasper%20Polane" title="Jasper Polane"><img alt="Jasper Polane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jasper%20Polane">Jasper Polane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418660/#Comment_418660" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-19T04:06:37+00:00" title="July 19, 2013  4:06AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2013 4:15AM by Jasper Polane.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yes, sorry if that wasn't clear.

This makes the 'apes come from Africa, fantasy Ape-men come from Not!Africa' reasoning actually OK in my eyes, because it is clearly not trying to establish a cultural parallel and can be regarded in the same way as an Orcish culture in Europe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418665/#Comment_418665" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-19T05:44:54+00:00" title="July 19, 2013  5:44AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>There really isn't that much difference between the way European culture and heritage is treated in game-settings, and the way Africa or Japan is.</blockquote>\nExcept that the the stereotypes associated with European culture aren't part of a long history of violence and oppression against Europeans?

Also possible I missed something, it was kind of hard to read.<br/><br/>Here's a thing, though, for serious, no sarcasm this time.<br/><br/>I don't like Pathfinder, because I don't like 3rd edition D&amp;D. It would be fairer to say I actively dislike it, actually. Sometimes I see Pathfinder stuff that has cool-looking art and I kind of wish I did like it. Even that awkward poster has some cool-looking stuff on it, it just needs a bit more thought put into the arrangement and presentation. But then I see something like that thread and I'm actually glad I don't like the game. Maybe if there were more of thejeff and Jessica Price and less of the other stuff, but there isn't and I'm glad I don't play this game or want to talk about it on the internet.<br/><br/>And also, I don't really like feeling that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418695/#Comment_418695" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-19T13:34:16+00:00" title="July 19, 2013  1:34PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2013 1:35PM by Andy.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To present a counter-view:<br/><br/>I liked 3rd edition D&amp;D up to a point (I ran the first game of it in all of Japan! That's when I was living there and all. I made sure to really give the system a workout, what with a Halfling Paladin, a Half-Orc Sorcerer, and so on): Ran or played it for years, including a year-long fantasy India-themed game back in the early 2000s. I got kinda sick of it, partly from overplay, partly for every single reason that <a href="/forums/profile/Ry">@Ry</a> addressed in his "E6" hack: It refreshed the game, made it new and brilliant again for me. Me and others (Mark?) were in a long campaign Clinton ran. Lots of fun (half elven Rogue-Spirit Shaman), though it was mostly shlock western fantasy. Then I kinda just drifted on, but I kept my eye on it since.<br/><br/>I wasn't super amazed by the settings and presentations of background that 4E did, though I did dig the system at times, loathe it at others.<br/><br/>But Pathfinder! Man, again, through the lens of that E6 Hack, it was a super solid game. And all the early release material, all the strong PC-analogues like the often cited paladin, cleric, and so on. Great, great stuff. I never like bought a drowning amount of Pathfinder stuff; I just have the core book and two packs of those "Pawns" miniatures ( see: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18580/pathfinder-npc-codex-awesome-minis-for-13th-age-other-fantasy-games-with-tactics/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18580/pathfinder-npc-codex-awesome-minis-for-13th-age-other-fantasy-games-with-tactics/p1</a> ) (and seriously, they did so well with that, though they are mostly quasi-Euro-based characters). But I like what they did, even in the trappings of schlock western fantasy, with good portrayals of race and gender.<br/><br/>Which is why it was disappointing to see the map (looks like folks in the thread say it's two years old or so, so not likely a fixable thing unless they print more), for particularly the reasons described in that thread: The Mali-analogue is huge, technological, moral, and fantasy-awesome... but on the map, all we see is an Egyptian pharaoh dude (ok, cool; I've always like Egyptian history), a gnoll, an ape, and a white (green? hard to tell) pirate-y chick. Still, given their history with other player-facing stuff, I figure it was an oversight vs some ideology pogrom. <br/><br/>To that end, if there was some "Garund Box Set" or "Garund Campaign Book", filled with inspirational art and stuff (I'm thinking like the old Dark Sun: Ivory Triangle or Veiled Alliance sourcebooks, which portrayed the city-states as both tied squarely to real, ancient, historical, non-Euro cultures but at the same time giving off this sense of the fantastical and wonder), I would *easily* pick up the DM hat again, buy/read it, and run that for friends.<br/><br/>...but yeah, given some of the Other Responses in that thread, I might be a little picky when recruiting players...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418696/#Comment_418696" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-19T14:49:27+00:00" title="July 19, 2013  2:49PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm running Pathfinder currently for my son and nephews by request.  <br/><br/>I think it's important to give Pathfinder credit for including black characters and African-inspired cultures.  In my observation, accusations of racism are pointed at people who include blacks, but not at the tons of games that have essentially no blacks.  If I were a publisher, my conclusion would be that the way to not appear racist is apparently to not have blacks in my game - which seems rather backwards to me.  <br/><br/>My reading of the Golarion setting guide was that it seemed more inclusive and not particularly problematic.  I wasn't able to read the text on the poster from the original post - but the topic is about the setting as a whole.  In my brief foray into Pathfinder Society play last fall, I played an Mwangi cleric.  There were a few questions about how to pronounce his name (taken from the Mwangi names list), but he fit in fine otherwise.  My impression was of a setting was generally favorable that it stretched the standards of fantasy.  <br/><br/>Most of my favorite African-inspired fantasy - like the Imaro stories - include plenty of stereotypes.  However, they aren't limited by them.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418888/#Comment_418888" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T10:41:15+00:00" title="July 23, 2013 10:41AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jasper,<br/>  I am not trying to pick on you, but apes exist in other parts of the world besides Africa.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418957/#Comment_418957" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-24T12:49:08+00:00" title="July 24, 2013 12:49PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oz even had flying apes and it didnt seem very African. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18621/is-the-pathfinder-setting-ethically-problematic" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18621/is-the-pathfinder-setting-ethically-problematic" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18621/is-the-pathfinder-setting-ethically-problematic/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18621%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18621%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
