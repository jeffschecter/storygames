I thought I'd pitch some questions at the braintrust and see what solutions y'all come up with. Cool? Cool. <br/><br/>The setting overview is this: <br/><i>Long, long ago, your great grandparents arrived on this world in a vast starship. The ship carried people who had slept for a thousand lifetimes on the long, silent voyage through the gulf of space away from their dying star to this, their new home. Slowing to approach this world something went terribly wrong - some malfunction or accident - and the starship fell from the sky, dashing itself to mountainous pieces on the surface of the planet. <br/><br/>Escape pods were lunched as the mothership tumbled, burning, and shot out for thousands of miles over the curving panorama. Many were lost but a few landed favourably and those that survived soon fought their way clear of the wreckage. Salvaging what they could, your great grandparents looked about this alien world and grieved for their species; it was an alien wilderness of strange, primeval jungle of fungus, coral and massive, chitinous creatures. <br/><br/>Little of their fabulous technology worked. Their artificial intelligences were either silent or mad and their batteries and generators flickered and died in the following months and years. They built shelter abutting their crash sights, defended themselves against predators and tried to teach their children what they'd need to know to survive.  </i><br/><br/>Player characters are the third generation after the (2d6) initial survivors. The omens are right (or perhaps now venerable great grandparents have decreed it) and settlements are sending forth their young men and woman to explore the world, uncover its secrets and contact other settlements. Who knows what caches of forgotten technology lay hidden under pulsing creepers, what strange civilisations have grown up in a hundred years and whether or not humanity can master their unforgiving new home. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>What's appealing to me about this set up is that all the PCs are going to be related in some way and all apart of a small, intimate community that they'll journey from and return to with riches or tales of horror. Nothing like the death of a sibling to really make you <i>feel</i> the OSR. <br/><br/>What I wanted to pick your brain over is what you might expect the third generation of maroonees to know about their ancestors, about fantastic technologies they've never seen and repeated, poorly comprehended eduction their forebears laid down. I imagine star-faring <br/>humanity having a great reliance on advanced, automated systems and artificial technology. Star Trek stuff. How do you teach the next generation when your education was all VR psych-impressioning? <br/><br/>Also, talking numbers. If there are (2d6) survivors on mixed gender, how many persons would a settlement have by the third generation? I'm thinking perhaps 50, but I'm not sure that number holds up to scrutiny. Any genealogy buffs in the house?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Lastly, I'm a big fan of D&amp;D that doing its thing outside of the fantasy genre. Can anyone help me come up with a few good examples. I remember there was a western D&amp;D around a while ago, I want to say... <i>Owlbears &amp; Outlaws</i>? And I'm a big fan of <i>Into the Odd</i>, too. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442973/#Comment_442973" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T00:45:11+00:00" title="February 18, 2015 12:45AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2015 12:45AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it's only the third generation, I would expect they have a pretty decent or at least non-mythological idea of what the previous world was like.<br/><br/>Like, 3 generations ago was World War I and Prohibition.

If survival required constant attention, perhaps only the most vital wilderness/survival skills would have been taught strenuously; everything else would be secondary in importance, and everyone's education would include different stuff.<br/><br/>I think there'd be a lot of "telephone" i.e. a lot of words you heard frequently used by your grandparents and maybe even use casually yourself, but you use them slightly wrong, or understand them only as metaphors.<br/><br/>Here's an attempt at a genealogy, modified from the one I did for AW...<br/><br/>Your Grandparents (you may have never met them, depending) - Year 0<br/>People who were of childbearing age when the crash occurred.  They inventoried and distributed whatever gear could be used, and their desperate experiments led to developments like (insert survival mechanisms here).  But they were divided into a myriad distributed communities - many little more than traumatized cavedwellers - and struggled to learn how to survive among bizarre lifeforms, weird weather, occasionally discovering randomly-scattered caches or the hideouts of lone survivors long gone completely insane...  and some of them survived.<br/><br/>Your Parents - Year 25<br/>Their children, who came of childbearing age in those slowly-stabilizing communities, for whom the weirdest details about this planet were regarded as normal facts of life.  They remembered much of what their parents talked about during their childhoods, but depending on how harsh their situation was, a lot of this data was disregarded or misinterpreted.  The word "Earth" started to sound like the word "Eden".  By the time they reached adulthood Survival of the Fittest was the rule in at least some areas.  These people lived in very different world from <i>their</i> parents.  For one thing, they lacked any direct experiences of the previous civilization; they had no personal memories of Life Before the Crash.  Their ideas of "civilization" were nascent, random, and frequently brutal.  Some of them began to develop new technologies, new social systems, new ways of living, some began reaching out, cobbling together little experiments that were sometimes workable, creating the first true "settlements", adapting more readily to the harsh realities of life... and some of them survived.<br/><br/>You - Year 50<br/>Their children, most of whom are of childbearing age now.  That's you.  You remember much of the above from your childhood, and things haven't changed that much.  If anything the major concepts of the game world - technology, slang, lore, etc - have now become crystalized.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442979/#Comment_442979" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T05:28:43+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  5:28AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I rather like the idea of generating the PC community from first principles, starting with 2d6 interbreeding survivors. As you say, it makes it personal, and it'll make for an interesting supply situation concerning replacement characters. You should also randomize or otherwise determine the local 3rd-generation lifestyle: water, sustenance, shelter, preserved aspects of high technology, discovered aspects of low technology. A snappy method can then be reused to quickly generate the other communities the PCs stumble upon, which allows you to give quick and interesting answers on matters such as potential marriage partners or the presence of blacksmithing.<br/><br/>I imagine that by third generation you'd have roughly half of the population largely ignorant of the greater cosmos, but also another half whose personal character, parents and grandparents would conspire to leave them with a pretty solid picture of what's what. Perhaps even more if the original settlers were various flavours of cultural actors as opposed to a random sampling of Earth humanity. I know that if I personally were facing a localized death of civilization like this, my first long-term project would be emblazoning the say one hundred most important facts on the brainspace (and preferably a big block of stone while I'm at it) of the descendants. "We live on a planet and it revolves around a sun", "there is no such thing as divine mandate to rule", stuff like that. A survival lifestyle that doesn't leave room for even oral culture is one that doesn't leave room for sanity either, after all.<br/><br/>Then again, if the high-tech society was incompetent due to technological infantilization, maybe they didn't have the social and pedagogical skills, or the sociohistorical perspective to really plan any long-term transmission of culture. With such a small community and short time-span, it all depends heavily on who and what the founders were. You could conceivably dice on this a bit as well; for example, if 50% of the colonists were useless drones, 15% were history buffs with some basic survival skills, 15% were social engineers of various flavours, and so on, perhaps this combined with some early social interaction randomization (was there fighting to establish social dominance in the first generation, how it went, etc.) might work to answer many questions about the current state of the community in a way that differs between individual tribes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442981/#Comment_442981" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T06:24:21+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  6:24AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would also imagine that the First Generation would have some sort of very special status in this society, being, effectively, aliens from another world and time. <br/><br/>They know things the others don't.

The birth rate could be low or high, the mortality rate could be low or high, there might be restrictions on how many of the original settlers could actually have kids (because of age, or how closely related they are, or personal preference, or medical issues, or...), there might have been disease or a resource shortage or a serious accident that kept the population from getting above a certain size, and so on.<br/><br/>Basically, wave your hands and lo, you get the small community you wanted to have.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442983/#Comment_442983" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T07:59:20+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  7:59AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2015 8:02AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does anyone have any idea of how many descendants 2d6 people would have?

Realistically the gender split per pod wouldn't be so neat unless the evacuation procedure of the ship was planned with that in mind, but I'll mark that down as an acceptable genre conceit.<br/><br/>So an average of three women of child-bearing age - their exact age won't matter, as technology and lifestyle skew the number of healthy child-bearing years anyway. One might assume that they won't be healthy enough to bear any more children in 15 years from landfall, no matter their specific age at the time.<br/><br/>We may assume that e.g. 50% of the pods adopt some sort of a lifestyle counter-productive to survival (e.g. they decide to implement a birth control regime, or they don't get along and refuse to breed together), but because those pods will have died out or joined with other clans by the third generation, we may also discount them when answering the question of what a single-pod community would look like in the third generation.<br/><br/>The successful monopods will thus range from a "barefoot and pregnant" breeding strategy of e.g. 5-10 children per mother to a more civilized "we need every hand on short-term survival" planned parenthood approach that'd result in say 3-5 children per mother. Considering the range in the number of 1st generation women (average 3, but could be more or less, and they could lose one or two without falling into the aforementioned non-viable category), we may conclude that the breeding strategy pod will have about 10-50 children in the 2nd generation, while the equality strategy pod will have 5-25.<br/><br/>At this point the otherwise viable pods will deviate strongly on the basis of the comparative success of their survival strategy: there's a big difference between being able to survive day to day as adult humans, and the ability to raise healthy children. We may again disregard e.g. 50% of the pods because nutritional deficiencies, hygiene practices or such cause drastic enough infant mortality to curtail growth and force the pod into joining with others or to die out.<br/><br/>Of the remaining pods that have sustainable life quality to raise the 2nd generation successfully, we may assume that they fall into four groups: there are breeding and planned parenthood pods, and those strategies will either work well or badly for the pod in question. A breeding pod will succeed if food is available easily, while a planned parenthood pod will be more resilient in general - and I will also assume that the planned parenthood pod has an edge on the medical sciences, simply because this whole idea of survival through extreme K-selection sounds to me like something you'd only try if you had your shit pretty well together as a community. If we assume a 70% infant mortality for an unfortunate breeding pod, 30% for a a fortunate one, 50% for an unfortunate planned parenthood pod and 10% for a fortunate one, we'll end up as follows on 2nd generation adults: 3-15, 7-35, 3-17, 5-23<br/><br/>The lower ends of those ranges are obviously something of non-starters (even less females than 1st generation), but the high end seems promising. The range of uncertainty caused by initial seeding, personal qualities and fortunes of survival somewhat outweight the choice of survival strategy, but we can say that a breeding pod will likely have about doubled its population in 2nd generation to 15 people or so, while a planned parenthood pod will maybe be slightly lower, at around 10 people. Socially they'll be very different, of course, as they've invested their work force in quite different types of activity: the breeding pod would have worked out a stable community capable of feeding all those mothers and children, while the planned parenthood pod would have focused on survival, life quality and long-term planning at the expense of increasing numbers. The breeder mothers each have about five-ish living children, while the planners each have three.<br/><br/>If we assume for simplicity's sake that the third generation breeds in similar patterns and the community doesn't face any major existential issues, and infant mortality goes down slightly due to increased experience with the chosen lifestyle, we may assume an average community of 35 for the breeder pod and 15 for the planner type pod in the 3rd generation.<br/><br/>Thus, my answer to Paul's question off the top of my head would be: about 15 adults in the 3rd generation for a more leftist sort of civilized community, or 35 for a full-scale conservative survivalist fantasy <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> For the full population of the community this translates into about 20-50 people, counting the 1st-2nd generation still alive when the 3rd hits adulthood. Obviously the population would be rather youth-biased.<br/><br/>Of course the real numbers can go down howevermuch ("giant cockroaches ate all but the three of us last year"), and they could also be up to 100% larger than that simply because everything went exceptionally lucky for this particular community through these generations. Also, multipod communities that have joined together at some point in the 1st, 2nd or 3rd generation will certainly offer even more possibilities of various sorts.<br/><br/>Ultimately the most important determinant of the amount of population would be the particulars of the local conditions and the history of the community; if I were determining the size of the population first thing, before knowing anything else about the community, I would be comfortable with a 1d50 roll per pod to find how many people there are in the third generation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442984/#Comment_442984" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T09:12:32+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  9:12AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the thoughts, guys! <br/><br/>Maybe I misspoke but I was thinking that the PC pool would be drawn from the third generation <i>after</i> the initial survivors. So it would be:<br/><br/><b>-&gt;</b> Your Great Grandparents. Survivors of the crash in year 0. <br/><b>-&gt;</b> Your Grandparents, first Humans to be born on the planet. Raised in whatever remnants of space-faring technology could be salvaged, reaching maturity by year 25.  <br/><b>-&gt;</b> Your Parents, second generation to be born. Probably very little technology from the past still functioning, reaching maturity by year 50. <br/><b>-&gt;</b> You. Third generation to be born. Technology that survives has ritual or emergency use only, reaching maturity by year 75. <br/><br/>Do the numbers still add up? <br/><br/>Your great grandparents could actually still be alive. Centenarians, miraculously still going after their upbringing in the medical culture of the techno-past (you, child, are not expected to be so long lived). Although, given the inhospitable nature of this <i>Jumanji/Nausica\xe4</i> planet, the very old would probably be quite rare and not necessarily coherent (at least, not to your ears. What even is "distress transmission" anyway?).<br/><br/>Strikes me that most pods could probably be literate. Technologically primitive, but literate. Which is a weird idea. By year 75 you might reasonably expect a flourishing pod to have some kind of recorded history and book keeping. Depends how badly technological infantilization has effected the survivors. Also, I wonder how useful being literate would be when exploring the world - after 75-100 years, would I be able to communicate easily with people from another pod?<br/><br/>This game definitely starts with the players sitting down and building their family tree together. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442985/#Comment_442985" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T09:37:55+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  9:37AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2015 9:42AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After a 100 years the spoken language should still be intelligible, and the written language would of course have changed not at all.<br/><br/>For writing to be preserved there needs to be ample access to something paper-like. Making paper out of wood pulp (or lumps - where'd you get those anyway) would likely be out of question, unless the survivors have both detailed chemistry knowledge and the material science to build the necessary vats and extract the chemicals - I wouldn't even try, personally, unless I had some sort of mining bots or such to help me past the biggest hurdles.<br/><br/>More likely is some natural product that makes for a reasonable writing surface. Historical examples are papyrus reed, wood bark, stone and animal skins. Stone takes too much work for writing to be very common, skins are too valuable, and plant products depend on what is available in the local ecosystem. Hit and miss on whether literacy will be preserved long-term, although I'd expect the 3rd generation born after landing to still practice it some if there are any texts available from the early days.<br/><br/>(For those wondering about "losing" literacy and whether it's even possible for human society - the Greek aborogines apparently pretty much lost literacy during the Greek dark ages, when the Minosian culture disappeared. Simply not enough surplus economy to support specialists like scribes with nothing worthwhile for them to record, I expect.)<br/><br/>As for the population numbers in the next generation (after the one I calculated above), assuming the same conditions apply, the 3rd-generation-born-since-landing would consist of 20-60 people, and the single-pod community would total roughly 30-100 people. I'd be happy rolling 1d100 per pod to find how many people are alive a 100 years after landfall. I imagine that'll help you far as a GM for an ultra-simple abstraction - decide how many pods have gone into a given community, and roll 1d100 for each to find the current total population.

However, also in the pod was Second Ensign A.J. Rimmer, who is now a legendary traitor (not unlike a mythological figure or minor deity) after he almost doomed the colony with his shenanigans and eventually was slain by the Captain. Those hailing from the community say they are "from the line of Hollister", and have a ridiculous and barbaric way of dealing with traitors, thieves, and cowards.<br/><br/>However, you also know from the lore of the community that the ship had on board a famous doctor. If perhaps you could find where his pod crashed (and whether there is a community there), you might be able to glean some wonderful medical technologies or expertise which has been passed on to his descendants.<br/><br/>If you had a list of all the crewmembers, and a table for generating reputations for them (maybe a table where you randomly combine a role - e.g. Captain, ship's doctor, etc. - and a reputation or character trait), you could use these to generate the lineage of each community.<br/><br/>This could be fun if different people were to play this game and compare notes on "their" Captain or "their" Hollister, etc, etc. - sort of a shared mythology around the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443030/#Comment_443030" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-20T11:31:49+00:00" title="February 20, 2015 11:31AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You would get divergence in vocabulary as the pods coin words for things unfamiliar to them before the crash.

Going missing in the jungle. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technology.</span><br/><br/>(1d3) Pieces of technology are salvageable from the wreckage. For each roll on the following table... (1d12):<br/><br/>1. A weapon's cache. The survivors are well stocked with light rifles, armoured vests, field scanners and grenades. There are 3d20 of each. <br/>2. Medical suite and equipment. An automated medical suite with an internal power supply. Survivors only have a 10% chance of dying in their first four years and have 25% more offspring.<br/>3. Plasma Tools. Powerful equipment that can cut metal and rock like butter. Attempts to enlarge and improve the settlement are made easier within reason.<br/>4. Terraforming tents. The environment inside these large, clear domes is made hospitable and fertile. Attempts at horticulture flourish, lessening the chance of famine. The domes can be expanded once per generation with a successful INT roll. <br/>5. Lifting frames. Mechanical exoskeletons that fit loosely around the human form allowing the wearer to lift and carry several tons, complete with claws and telescopic limbs. <br/>6. Genetics suite. 1d6 birthing pods that can each clone 2d10 persons per generation. <br/>7. Automated Servitors. 3d10 mute automata that will perform tasks shown or described to them. Only official codes can enable them to harm human beings. <br/>8. A.I. shard. A subsystem of the starship's Artificial Intelligence survives. The A.I is (1d4)...1. a navigation system concerned with interstellar travel; 2. a tactical system concerned with weapons targeting and point-defense; 3. a colonisation system that assumes the ship has landed and its massive terraforming plants are at work; 4. a data system with a dense and technical log of the ship's functions prior to the crash. There is a 25% chance that no sense can be made of the whatever information the A.I provides. <br/>9. Powerplant. A generator that doubles the lifespan of any technology powered by it. <br/>10. Comms System. A central node with 2d6 handheld devices that allow verbal communication over dozens of miles. <br/>11. Naval Ordnance. (1d2) A large piece of interstellar naval ordnance designed to disintegrate asteroids or a collection of high-explosive deep space mines (1d20 charges or mines). <br/>12. Long-range scanners. A huge dish whose original purpose was to examine distant astronomical bodies. A successful INT roll must be made to turn it to another purpose, such as to scan the surface of the planet. <br/><br/>Typically, each piece of technology will last 1d100 years from the crash.

I'd want only as many tables as necessary to give some basic facts to shape interpretation. <br/><br/>So, I had a quick roll on my tables so far to see if it sets off the imagination. Here's my sample community at the barest bones:<br/><br/>First Generation. <br/>11 survivors, 3 of which are officers. 5 men, 6 women. The only female officer dies of her wounds in the first year and a male is lost in the wilderness in the third year. From the wreckage the survivors salvage 9 Automated Servitors (that will function until year 81) and 18 deep-space mines (that will function until year 35). <br/>All females attempt to have children and produce 6 females and 2 males.  <br/><br/><i>(Second Generation. <br/>The 8 members of the second generation breed and have 15 children, 10 females and 5 males.<br/>Third Generation.<br/>The 15 members of the third generation breed and have 26 children, 13 females and 13 males.)</i><br/><br/>Just talking in terms of hard numbers and stating tech we can already imagine what this society looks like and start asking questions. Who are the officers, and what do they know?  Were the survivors polygamous, how were the children raised? Who controls the Servitors? How have they helped? How have the mines been used? Do we know they're defunct by Year 35? And so on. <br/><br/>The necessary tables would probably be Population, Technology, Geography, Culture &amp; Knowledge, and Historic Events. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>,<br/><br/>Thank you for the heads up on Heroquest.

Although if you wanted to play a direct descendant, you could do a genealogical tale with bloodline themes in it.

Once you've explored all the generations, you're either in Gen 4 and moving forwards from there, or you have to start a new colony (and the current one becomes another detail in the GM's toolbox, to flesh out the planet).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443302/#Comment_443302" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T08:07:22+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  8:07AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Perhaps, when going forward in time, the random roll gets some kind of adjustment for what has happened so far, or how many survivors are still present?<br/><br/>(I like the idea of a "reset" being a desperate move, but it wouldn't work if it can be used to erase all the consequences of bad player decisions/luck, effectively restarting with all the old advantages. Screwing things up for your colony *should* affect how the next generation turns out.)</blockquote>\nI think I see basically two alternatives.<br/><br/>The first is that jumping in time tends to be a bad idea. Maybe the expectation of number of people goes down (the population as a stochastic process is a supermartingale) or there is significant chance of extinction or losing acquired benefits.<br/><br/>This would lead to desperate survivalism, where the actions of player characters are the only thing that can prevent defeat.<br/><br/>The second possibility is that going forward generally improves the colony's situation: The population tends to increase from what it was earlier (submartingale), technology and acquired benefits are generally not lost, and so on.<br/><br/>In order to make this meaningful one should have a clear goal or time limit. For example, in how few generations can you conquer the megadungeon that was the mothership? Skipping forward in time would mean making the game easier.<br/><br/>In a D&amp;D-like game I would be uncomfortable moving backwards in time, since by nature of the game anything could happen there. You go back in time and then one of your ancestors causes a nuclear disaster that wipes out the entire village, or half of it, say. Such major consequences should be on table in D&amp;D play, and I don't think they are nicely compatible with backwards time travel. Maybe someone has a good solution for this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
