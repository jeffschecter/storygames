From what I'd read before I thought the whole ratting thing only happened at the very very end of the game.  So my thought was, so we play out these scenes and then the whole thing just comes down to a vote?  That didn't seem like very much fun.<br/><br/>But after reading the rules what grabs me is the iterative process of MANY ratting phases thereby creating a level of social pressure and uncertainty based on ratting history.  But, on reading, the system almost seems to discourage this in that the number of cards players draw back is very very small.  Only enough for one or two more scenes a piece.  It seems to me that by the third or fourth ratting phase the whole thing would be a mite tedious and iterative prisoner's dilemma problems (which this is based on, I know) don't get interesting until the seventh or eighth iteration.<br/><br/>So how does this work in play?  How many "rounds" does the game usually go?  Does the ratting reach a point of stasis where each round of ratting is more less the same result wise as the last?  What kind of criteria does the GM use to decide whether or not to end the game?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102784/#Comment_102784" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T14:58:44+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  2:58PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played the game once, as GM<br/><br/>the players thought I was going to go for another round, after the first ratting phase, but I didn't, to suprise them (and also so we could try out another game afterwards)<br/><br/>this was very successful in producing an unexpected result (one player ratted, the other didn't)<br/><br/>so just because you only play one round doesn't mean the game is no fun<br/><br/>the uncertainty of whether this round is going to be the last is key<br/><br/>also, you should stop playing once everyone heas been ratted on (that much is obvious)<br/><br/>another easy criteria is simply to judge whether you have time for another round or not (the game was designed with this in mind)<br/><br/>any help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102831/#Comment_102831" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T17:02:15+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  5:02PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, yes, the very uncertainty that the game may or may not go on adds a level I wasn't expecting from the basic summaries I had read.

If you knew the game was only going to have one ratting each time that would be lost, and the game would be a lot simpler.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the first ratting the game enters a new phase, so to speak, and the focus of the story is usually shifted from "what kind of mess is this guy in?" to "will he get out of this mess alive?". The tempo is increased, player characters are being chased by the police or their enemies, and so on. That's why you only get one or three cards: if you're ratted on you're in a tight spot and really need to use your only chance for a conflict to do something worthwhile. That's why people tend to use this conflict to get that last thing done before it's to late, be it rescuing their kidnapped daughter or professing their love to the femme fatale. You can do this in the epilogue as well, of course, but it's usually more fun to do it in an actual conflict. I don't want to discourage multiple rounds, quite the contrary, but I want them to be different from the part of the game before the first ratting (the "exploration phase").<br/>\n<br/>\nAll games I've played and heard other people play have lasted for one or two rounds of ratting. That seems to be enough for one evening of play. For me it's hard to trick the players completely in this way, since they know as well as I do what time it is and how much we have left of the evening, but the uncertainty is still there. It would be very interesting some time to play a lot of rounds, as you say, to see what happens to the story. You could even play a black card when it's time to quit for the evening and pick the game up next time. I honestly don't know how it would be to start a session in the middle of the story, with the players having one or three cards, but I sure would like to try some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never experienced multiple rattings with exactly the same outcome. You would expect that some would rat and some wouldn't the first round, and then everyone would retaliate or keep ratting the next round. But I've been surprised by player choices, where the "right" thing to do would be to rat, but instead they don't. They rat the first time around, and it's almost certain the people they ratted on will rat back, but the next time they're quiet. The reasons for doing this vary, but it makes for powerful stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I game master the game my main criteria for stopping, as hoog says, is is to look at the clock. Also, do the players seem energized to go for another round, or are they looking for the story to climax? If I feel there's still material left (unresolved conflicts, unfinished story threads, things left hanging) that would be cool to include I might let the game go for another round or cut the game and let the players deal with stuff in their epilogues. The game master gets to say when it's time to end, but not how it will end.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, I found a text relevant to One Can Have Her in the Wikipedia article on the prisoner's dilemma I've overlooked before, the part on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#Morality" rel="nofollow">morality</a>. When you role-play the dilemma, though, you can choose to be amoral just to make the moral statement that it's wrong, which is interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Jonas                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102864/#Comment_102864" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T02:51:13+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  2:51AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I come to G\xc3\xb6teborg in November you just have to gm this for me, Jonas.
