All rolls are player-facing. So no more dice rolling for the DM. Anything that's a DM roll is flipped to a player roll. For example, instead of the DM rolling to-hit for the bad guys, the players roll to defend against the attack. It's easy enough to do the maths. Static DC from the DM instead of a roll, whatever bonuses they have +10 = DC. So instead of a +6 attack, it's a DC16 attack. Players defend with static -10 plus a d20 roll. So instead of AC18, it's a roll with +8. Enemy crits would happen when the players roll a natural 1 on their defense. Simple and the math is the same. <br/><br/>2. Success at cost. I think the best way to introduce a success at cost mechanic is to put a small range of numbers around the actual DC of a roll that represents a success at cost. For example, on a DC20 check any roll of 19, 20, or 21 would count as a success at cost. A success at cost would be you marginally damaging a target but them not harming you. You doing full damage, but the target damaging you in some way. And various other 'costs' that games like Dungeon World use to keep things more interesting and less 'stand there and hack' style experiences. <br/><br/>3. Make the combat round more fluid. Basically steal Dungeon World narrative combat whole cloth. <br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449535/#Comment_449535" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-16T21:43:25+00:00" title="November 16, 2015  9:43PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're certainly not the first to go into this territory.
