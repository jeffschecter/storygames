I have designed roleplaying games for close to twenty years, professionally since 1995, but it might be that I've misunderstood something...<br/><br/>So what is this "reward mechanism", and why is it so important to the roleplaying?                </div>

                            Waitwaitwait...<br/><br/>Thomas says "I have never considered [the reward mechanism] paramount to the gaming experience"  and then "what is this reward mechanism and why is it important...?"<br/><br/>How can you have an opinion about it if you're not sure what it is?<br/><br/>Then Jack says, "I agree..., RPG's do not need reward mechanisms."<br/><br/>Jack, you're agreeing with something that Thomas didn't say.<br/><br/>Let's start with definitions.<br/><br/>The Forge provisional glossary defines the "Reward System" thus:<br/><br/>a) The personal and social gratification derived from role-playing, a feature of Creative Agenda. (b) In-game changes, usually to a player-character, a feature of System and Character. (c) As a subset to (b), improvement to one or more of the character's Components. Typically, the term refers to how (a) is facilitated by (b).<br/><br/>You may not like this definition, but my guess is that this is where Adam is coming from.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the reward system is founded in the gratification of play.  To facilitate this feeling, most games allow for players to earn the ability to make changes to the game when they accomplish things in the game that are in accordance with the creative agenda.  Usually, this involves changes to the PC (commonly known as 'experience') but it doesn't have to. For example, in Ray Winninger's Underground, players can earn the right to improve the standard of living (measured in a half dozen different ways) of the community where the PC's live.  This is a good reward mechanism because RWU is intended to be a simulationist game about social problems.<br/><br/>Some games don't have reward systems.  Traveller (the old old black box version) didn't have a strong reward mechanism.  Gamma World first edition had one but it was very, very slow.  It's no coincidence that when new editions were made of these games, they were given reward systems.<br/><br/>If your game doesn't have a reward system, then it is missing a significant tool that games use to reinforce the creative agenda.  If you aren't using that tool, or replacing it with something at least as effective, then yes, I can see how the game would have problems.<br/><br/>To Jack: No, games don't need reward systems.  Baron Munchausen doesn't.  Pantheon doesn't.  They have rewards, but those aren't reward systems because they don't feed back into the game world (Shared Imagined Space).  It should be noted, however, that both of these games are designed to be played in a single short session (an hour or two) and there's no character continuity whatsoever; each game is totally separate from the one before.  They don't fall flat because they have a different mechanism, a "winning system" if you will, to replace it.<br/><br/>When I was a child, I used to play with my grandmother's dominoes.  I'd build buildings out of them, knock them down, slide them around... she didn't like that at all.  She wasn't so much worried about what happened to them... dominoes are easily replaced... but she didn't consider it to be a "game" and it wasn't... I had reduced the dominoes to a toy.  She called this activity "dummy-noes" and refused to have anything to do with it. There was really no room for interaction or challenge in the way I was playing.  I haven't read FateClock, but I suspect that may be what is going on.<br/><br/>You both are, of course, permitted to disagree with my opinion.  I'm not trying to convince either of you; I'm merely trying to amplify Adam's comment about reward systems by explaining my own understanding of the topic.  I'm sure other people will have a different take on what Adam meant.                        </div>

                            Before going on, could I check the terminology?<br/><br/>Tomas, I think that Adam is actually asking for <i>character advancement</i> in your game (as the terms are commonly used). Character advancement can be part of a <i>reward system</i>, but they're slightly different concepts. <br/><br/>So Jack's correct in the sense that RPGs do not need character advancement. I think it's impossible for an RPG not to have a <i>reward system</i>, at least at the social level: if a player says "I want to climb that wall", and the GM says "Cool!", that's a reward system.<br/><br/>Stop me if I'm wrong, of course.<br/><br/>It looks as though there was a discussion on the Forge about reward systems last winter. Have a look at:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17508.0" rel="nofollow">Reward Cycle II: Cycle Sans System</a><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17489.0" rel="nofollow">Reward Cycle</a><br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Graham, I think that when Adam talks about "reward mechanism" he's talking about something in the rules rather than the reward cycle, which as you observe happens whether there is a system to reinforce it or not.                        </div>

                            Hi Fred,<br/><br/>As it happens I was going to cite Traveller as an example of a good game without a reward mechanic. And while it may be the case that later versions introduced such things, I put this down as a significant part in why Black Box was better than the versions that followed. We continued to play black box (actually a hybrid; we borrowed the extra careers from MegaTraveller) long after later editions had been released.<br/><br/>Your point about dominoes also rings true with me. Because I think what you did is a whole load more enjoyable than playing the actual game based around them. When I was a kid we spent hours and hours playing with Star Wars action figures and Star Guards and Aliens, telling little stories in which the characters faced challenges we made up for them. For me, roleplaying is the current incarnation of the same kind of thing.<br/><br/>In particular I think your statement "I had reduced the dominoes to a toy" has it all backwards; you'd taken a boring game and created something interesting, imaginative and fun out of it.                        </div>

                            Hey, everyone, thanks for weighing in but let's not play "guess what Adam is saying." <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  Fred, though, has the gist of it.<br/><br/>I have two concerns with the design of FateClock. <br/><br/>The first is the static nature of the character. It seems hard to tell a story of substance without a means to effect change in the character. The only changes that can occur in this game are those that happen purely "on the table," with one exception, and that's the Fate Burden. And the player has no control over his own Fate Burden; it's entirely in the hands of the cards and his opponents. You play out all these scenes and the world changes but your character is just furniture unless he turns into Satan.<br/><br/>The second is the lack of support -- as far as I can tell from a dry read -- for any kind of Creative Agenda. That doesn't mean a player can't have a CA while playing FateClock. I just don't think there's anything in the rules that support one. If you don't buy into the Big Model and Creative Agenda and all that jazz, then we're not going to be able to have much of a discussion about this. That's the foundation from which I work and the basis on which I judge role-playing games -- along with my gut instincts, too. Note that I'm not saying that FateClock isn't fun! I'm saying that it's a fun toy, not a fun RPG, because it's missing a key element. I'm not a huge fan of "story games" that aren't "role-playing games" (by the loose definitions we all throw around). This is more like Once Upon a Time than Traveller, ya know? <i>To me</i>, that doesn't warrant a high Cool score, and I feel I operate within the spirit of the contest rules to score in the Cool Factor category according to what jazzes me.<br/><br/>I will read Graham's links and comment on those if they make me change my mind (which is entirely possible) but I wanted to jump in and clear up where my original comments originated and eliminate the guessing.                        </div>

                            To distinguish between "game" &amp; "toy", I like Greg Costikyan's defintions in his excellent 1994 essay, <a href="http://www.costik.com/nowords.html" rel="nofollow">"I Have No Words and I Must Design"</a>. In that, he says that games have goals, toys do not.
<blockquote><cite>I Have No Words and I Must Design</cite>According to Will Wright, his Sim City is not a game at all, but a toy. Wright offers a ball as an illuminating comparison: It offers many interesting behaviors, which you may explore. You can bounce it, twirl it, throw it, dribble it. And, if you wish, you may use it in a game: soccer, or basketball, or whatever. But the game is not intrinsic in the toy; it is a set of player-defined objectives overlaid on the toy.</blockquote>
The reward system, as I understand it, is a way of directing goals &amp; objectives to the players so that the rest of the rules (the 'toy' part) can be used in a game-like fashion, and thus, maintain longterm interest.
<blockquote><cite>I Have No Words and I Must Design</cite>"But what about roleplaying games?" [...] they have goals; lots of them, you get to pick. Rack up the old experience points. Or fulfill the quest your friendly GM has just inflicted on you. Or rebuild the Imperium and stave off civilization's final collapse. Or strive toward spiritual perfection. Whatever.<br/><br/>If, for some reason, your player characters don't have a goal, they'll find one right quick. Otherwise, they'll have nothing better to do but sit around the tavern and grouse about how boring the game is. Until you get pissed off and have a bunch of orcs show up and try to beat their heads in.</blockquote>

                            Jack: Traveller was an excellent game.  I played a lot of it, too, and long after other games had surpassed it in sophistication. <br/><br/>It is fairly easy to let a reward system creep into Traveller.  The way it happened in our game was in terms of money, power, and scope.  Our characters started off as a "troubleshooter" team, taking contracts with various employers to handle problems that their internal elements were not prepared for.  Later, we acquired our own ship and started on a career as privateers in a nasty little war on the outskirts of the Empire.  Gradually we were able to amass quite a fortune by selling prize ships at a discount to our patrons, and decided that it was time to settle down.  We went to a number of oppressively governed planets and smuggled out a few hundred like-minded families, and then brought them out to an uninhabited world on the edge of civilization to found a small colony.  Gradually the colony grew, but word eventually got out about where we were and the planets our colonists had come from banded together to send a warfleet to forcibly return their citizens.  Diplomatic and military adventures ensued, which eventually resulted in getting our colony recognized as a member world of the Empire, and as such protected from the kind of unsubtle conquest our enemies were pursuing.  At that point we declared victory and started something else.<br/><br/>None of the changes that happened to our characters were bought with experience points, but there very definitely was a reward process going on - you could see it on the character sheet as "Cr" started to be replaced by "KCr" and then "MCr".<br/><br/>God, I loved that game.<br/><br/>Anyways, my point is that when there isn't a reward mechanic built into a game, players will very often find one.  In a game where wealth and gear are important definitions of who a character is and what he can do (like in Trav) the accumulation of wealth and gear will usually become a reward mechanic.<br/><br/>Edit: Crossposted with Warren<br/><br/>Exactly, Warren.                        </div>

                            Okay, I've read the links Graham provided. He has something there and isn't blowing smoke.<br/><br/>The problem is that it's hard to understand how this game's reward system will play out without actually playing it. But let's look at a potential instance of play for FateClock. In my mind, it's a series of scenes for a group of players that culminates in someone's Fate Burden reaching 0 and that Rider being declared the Lord of Evil, who then decides the fate of the world. Right?<br/><br/>My friends and I do all that for a few hours. What was the payoff? <br/><br/>I believe that Tomas' answer (in the form of the rules) is:
<blockquote>You may, of course, make use of more extreme measures, describing in detail how your mentality is engulfed by the shadow of itself, and how the core of your mentality goes evil, marking the world for darkness in it's own, very unique way. Or you may opt for an approach inspired by the game you've had, weaving the events of the game into your narrative of the last reckoning...</blockquote>
So, at best, the rules supply some guidance that the Lord of Evil <i>may</i> take the events of the game and weave them into a conclusion that makes sense. Or he can just destroy it all or make up some nonsensical ending. "It's up to you, oh great Lord of Evil!" Right?<br/><br/>Maybe this is a reward system. It's a bizarre one, for sure. Here's my characterization of the reward system: <i>The group selects its Lord of Evil -- the person they trust to write the epilogue -- when individual members (as opponents) choose to decrease the spotlight player's Fate Burden after a conflict (win or lose) when a black card is drawn.</i>  Tomas, would you agree with that? Graham?<br/><br/>If you are saying that play is its own reward, then I disagree. "I play because I like to play!" No... <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/>  So, I was fast and loose with terminology and I probably shouldn't have been but I really meant that I didn't think the game had a reward <i>system</i> (in the terminology used in the articles Graham linked). Worse, I was probably wrong. The game does seem to have a reward system, as I described above, but it doesn't do anything for me, and thus my Cool Factor points stay in my wallet.                        </div>

                            Fred,<br/><br/>I agree.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is simply that a game doesn't need to have explicit set of reward mechanics; rewards are, as other's have pointed out, always there is some form. Reward mechanics make explicit what the game is about; and reward you for doing it - which is a good thing, in general - but sometimes just having a sandbox you can do neat stuff in is what you want.                        </div>

                            My very simplified take on all of it is just this: I want to see characters be able to change, in a tangible (i.e., on the sheet, evincing rules-affecting changes in play) fashion, in response to the events of play.  This doesn't mean "advancement" per se, but it does mean that no character should be an unchanging, never-moving rock in a rapidly flowing stream.  This is not a principle I had fully appreciated until I sent Don't Rest Your Head through its playtest rounds, and one of the things that came back (from Judd Karlman, no less) was that the game didn't have any mechanism for characters to change over time.  Not <i>advance</i> -- change.  The comment gave birth to the 'scars' system, and I think is a lot stronger for it.                        </div>

If you aren't using that tool, or replacing it with something at least as effective, then yes, I can see how the game would have problems.I do not see this. There are numerous reasons why I do not see it.<br/><br/>1 - In 1989 I made the roleplaying game <b>Muu</b> in which your stats goes up and down, and no "reward mechanic" or "reward system" is evident. And still the game blows your mind like no other game I've encountered.<br/><br/>2 - In 1999 I published my traditional FRPG <b>Fabula</b>, with a traditional XP-system. Running Fabula without XP still makes the game tick, and it is still a great game.<br/><br/>3 - Intense and interactive roleplaying creates drama, and player involvement in the drama has its own rewards, beyond and better than anything induced by XP (or other mechanical awards).<br/><br/>I hold the idea that games without "reward systems" to be in some sort of problem, to be false. I suspect it to be based on a prejudice orginating in a convoluted vision of what a roleplaying game is. Your vision seem to be based on games operated mainly by mechanical means, and very much in the dark on the powerful methodical tools awailable.<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite> To Jack: No, games don't need reward systems.  Baron Munchausen doesn't.  Pantheon doesn't.  They have rewards, but those aren't reward systems because they don't feed back into the game ...I'm glad to hear you say that. However, it contradicts your former statement that indicates that a game without reward system is in trouble. Baron Munchausen is a great game, in it's own way. There is no lack of reward mechanics in it. A reward mechanic would not aply to the game at all. <b>FateClock</b> is of the same persuasion (although possibly not as great a game).<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite> There was really no room for interaction or challenge in the way I was playing.  I haven't read FateClock, but I suspect that may be what is going on.Well, there is a conflict system in the game, described as "elegant" by Adam the Reviewer, so there is indeed oportunities for both interaction and challenge.<br/><br/>After reading the comments here, I fear that Adam has failed to hit the target in his review. It's alright with me though. Writing the game was fun. I do not mind going against misconceptions of "what a game is" in my game design.</b> </div>

                            Whoa, dude. Remember that you're arguing about a couple points in the Cool Factor category, which is essentially "judge's fiat." I didn't mention my reward system concerns in the Playability category, where I scored you fairly high. If you need to justify a 5/10 "Cool" score as <i>my</i> failure so you can get sleep at night, go for it.<br/><br/>Edited: However, I just realized that some of this defensiveness on your part might stem from my labeling your game as a toy rather than a role-playing game.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite> It seems hard to tell a story of substance without a means to effect change in the character.  </blockquote> I believe what you really are saying here is that <i>"it seems hard to tell a story of substance without a means to effect <b>mechanical change</b> in the character"</i>. You have not done that, have you; tried to play a game with focus on how the character changes "internally"? (that is: in the mind of the player, and in the way the player represent the character in the drama). I have done so, in a lot of my games, and to great effect. It is in fact <b>very easy</b> to tell a substantial story in games not tied up in the mechanical sphere. It has to do with designing games which are strong in their methodical approach to the art of creating an interactive drama.<br/><br/>You may say that it is about including the strong feeling of narrative liberty mostly experienced in freeform games, into the design of a roleplaying game with a solid framework. My approach through many years has been one of methodical means more than mechanical, and I have found these means to be very effective. My latest step on this design path, before <b>FateClock</b>, is the game <b>Autumn of Life</b>. A game about friendship, lifechoices, harmony and death. Players of the game have stated that they have been moved on a deep personal level by it. One player told me, in confidence, that it had altered his way of thinking about death.<br/><br/>I hope you see that this is a way of designing games which is far beyond the "scope" presented in games ruled by mechanical "reward-systems". I have made my share of traditional game design. This webforum is a place where I hope to meet people with a broader view on what a game can be, and what it may accomplish.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>You play out all these scenes and the world changes but your character is just furniture unless he turns into Satan. </blockquote>Adam; I appreciate the difficulty in imagining gameplay on the basis of a concept that is strange to you. If you believe the drama of <b>FateClock</b> to be void until the aftermath of the game, then you have totally misread my design. That's too bad.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>...the lack of support -- as far as I can tell from a dry read -- for any kind of Creative Agenda.  </blockquote>I really believe the stated intention of the game; "being a game about investigating humanity, etc..." and the gameplay examples included in the text, to give ample support to a creative agenda. I expect players to follow the instructions of the game, reading it out aloud before play, and so each and every player should be able to see where this lead.<br/><br/>Maybe your read of <b>FateClock</b> has been too dry, Adam ;-)                        </div>

Please remember that all of this came up in the context of the Cool Factor category. Kevin's web site gives us scant help on deciphering what that means: "Wow, thatâ€™s cool factor" and "general cool factor" are the only things we have to go on. For me, I interpret the category as "would this thing be cool to play?"<br/><br/>Tomas, are you asking me to justify my score? I will do so if you ask.<br/><br/>For now, I will say that the game felt 5/10 "cool" <i>in my gut</i> and I searched for a rational justification of that feeling, and what came up was that it didn't feel like a complete role-playing game to me. The reward system just didn't hit the high notes for me. I made the mistake of characterizing the rules as a toy instead of a game (and I did mean in the Costikyan sense, as Warren pointed out) and again I apologize for that. I meant no insult by it. I just meant, I don't see the goal of play, so it's not "cool" <i>to me</i>.<br/><br/>If you want to understand my toy/game difference better, do read the Costikyan article, or at least the chunks Warren quoted. That's exactly what I meant. I am well familiar with the Costikyan definitions of toy and game and I used them in that sense, intentionally.                        </div>

                            There is "no lack" of reward mechanism in Baron Munchausen in the meaning that gameplay fucntions very well without it. The game is not lacking in that department. It follows that the department is not material to the function of a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>I'm not very worked up about this, but why beat about the bush? I did not understand the core of what Adam said in his review, and now, when I do understand, I believe he has read the design on  basis of a totally different design tradition than mine. It's a situation bound to create misunderstandings/misconceptions, but I live in the hope that they will be fruitful mis-somethings. :-)                        </div>

                            Okay, I think we've resolved the score stuff (as not important) and the game/toy stuff.  I still think we're not communicating well and I'd like to continue to discuss the reward system stuff with regards to FateClock, and why I think it's important.<br/><br/>I don't require a mechanical reward system in the sense of gaining experience points or something. I do expect, however, some procedural firmness that produces <i>with some predictability</i> fun play. I don't really see that in FateClock and maybe I have just missed it in my three or four readings of the game. I don't think so, though. But we can discuss it here and figure that out.<br/><br/>Tomas, you say your game is "about investigating humanity, etc." Can you tell me <i>how</i> it does that? <br/><br/>The support for that, as I see it, is that it tells the players to choose roles from some period of history. It sets up the Rider/Ridden stuff so there's some conflict. As far as I can tell, that's where the support ends. The conflict resolution system doesn't support this "investigating humanity" angle. The Fate Burden mechanism doesn't support it either and, to me, feels terribly out of place. The Lord of Evil mechanism doesn't seem to support it. It's not about humanity. It's about this godlike Rider thing that has little to do with humanity, unless the player somehow ties it into play, though the rules don't help me do that at all.<br/><br/>How does that stuff support "investigating humanity, etc." any more than you and I sitting down and saying, "let's investigate humanity" and role-playing using no rules to do so? <br/><br/>Could I "investigate humanity" just as well using some other ruleset that wasn't focused on this, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Marvel Superheroes?                        </div>

<p>In what way does Baron Munchausen not have a reward mechanism? You pay each other in money for the quality of their stories.  Winner buys a round.</p>
<p>It's a very basic, obvious reward mechanism.</p>
<p>Tomas is claiming that there is, in fact, a reward cycle, but it's not mechanically supported. I'd like to hear about that, because I think there's probably a process used to gain satisfaction in the game that's being followed, though it may not be written down.</p>

                            It might be helpful for people to consider my distinction between reward system and reward mechanic. I did introduce these terms to internet discourse about role-playing, so I might as well weigh in.<br/>
<br/>
The former is a reality - a feature of play. Without it, people don't continue to play. It's about people, communication, pleasure, and stuff like that. You tell me what you and the others did when it was clear to everyone that you wanted to <i>keep playing</i>, or <i>to play again</i>, and there it is.<br/>
<br/>
The latter is a ritualized procedure of some kind, or in plain language, a rule. Rules like this are only reward mechanics if they express or reinforce the reward system.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me that keeping these concepts distinct solves any of the questions raised so far. No, Tomas, you don't need reward mechanics. I certainly never said you did. It also seems to me, though, that identifying their lack as somehow purer than their presence is uncritical romanticism.<br/>
<br/>
Adam's saying that a particular design doesn't have reward mechanics - and for him, that means the reward system is less accessible, or in this case wholly inaccessible. That's a fair point, I think. If you don't have reward mechanics which match the intended reward systems, you've forced anyone who's not exactly in tune with you, personally, to guess. A lot of people aren't going to have the time or inclination to guess.<br/>
<br/>
If that's what you want, then that's OK too. I see nothing worth debating.<br/>
<br/>

In my experience, it's people glossing over what they really enjoy out of a game by substituting a generality.  Often, said person does not realize that the generality actually covers more ground than the specific thing they really like.  So you get some guy who really likes hammering his characters with emotional hurt, and he calls that "roleplaying."  And so when he says "roleplaying is its own reward" he means "hammering your character with emotional hurt is its own reward."  The fact that other people like other things and call that roleplaying either doesn't occur to the person, or those other people are wrong/mistaken/deluded/powergamers.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Edwards</cite>It also seems to me, though, that identifying their lack as somehow purer than their presence is uncritical romanticism.</blockquote>No, it's not romanticism. I refer to actual gameplay that have shown itself to be far superior to the gameplay you find in games focused on traditional reward mechanics. I am talking about life-changing gameplay here, nothing less.<br><br>My games with such qualities:<br><br><b>- Muu -</b> (1989)<br>This game is repeatedly creating a shared meditative state among the players. This state is accomplished through careful and consequent manipulation of the language used in the game, and the use of a ritualistic gameplay rythm.<br><br><b>- Choral -</b> (1992)<br>An almost unplayable game, due to the great effort the games master must put into each and every little support-character, to make the gameuniverse spring to life in a way that create the wanted magical-rural idyll to which the players respond, and by which they are trapped when the game evolves into a philosophically inspired tour the force of order and chaos, and then evolving even deeper in philosophical discourse, all the way dressed up as an epic saga of magic and song. This is the only game I have created where the whole group have sat around the table with tears running freely from every eye, deeply sorrowed by the happenings in the game.<br><br><b>- Fabula Wormtime -</b> (2003)<br>A module for my traditional rpg Fabula, but this time with some mean methodical tools to engulf the players in the life and death stress of soldiers in the field. It has created gameplay leaving the players with "dirty insides", a semblance of what a real soldier may experience after going in a murdering rampage in Vietnam or Iraq or Ucraina or anywhere. I've had players thanking me for bringing them to the point where they leave the gametable with shifty eyes, uncontrollable shakings and a strong feeling of despair. That's Wormtime, a war module for Fabula.<br><br/><b>Autumn of Life</b> (2006)<br/>A game about ordinary people facing old age and death. It brings you to the threshold of death 5-6 times in the course of a two hour gaming session, and then it brings you beyond death. Beyond the threshold of death you will experience the beauty of a true mutual harmony, created by you; the players.<br/><br/><b>Please: I do not list these games to brag.</b> I want you to understand that my background in roleplaying games differ from yours. In the context of games like these the idea that you "need" to have some sort of mechanical rewards for making great gameplay is, pardon me; meaningless. I find the term "reward system" slightly off the target too, but I do see the distinction and the importance of it. The problem with the term, in my view, is that it manipulates the playing field, telling you/me/all of us that it is all about reaching out for rewards. Give the players "rewards", and they will have a great time! I do not find that very helpful. As a general understanding of what this is all about, that notion is false. It applies only to certain games and in certain situations. I have no need to define the gameplay found in the games listed here within such a framework. I am certain that if I tried to do so, it would misappropriate the gameplay, and fall short of delivering a true understanding of it.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Edwards</cite>Adam's saying that a particular design doesn't have reward mechanics - and for him, that means the reward system is less accessible, or in this case wholly inaccessible. That's a fair point, I think. </blockquote>Yes, it is a fair point. However: I suspect that his reading of the game is flawed. I find indications that it is, and have pointed it out. That's my point.<br/><br/>Still; <b>FateClock</b> is not a great game. I had fun writing it, trying to wring a game out of the sheet of Meguey Baker, but the mediocre rating given by Adam is what the game deserved. It may be that another reader would give it a quite different rating though, and that's fine with me too. Any single game will communicate with any given player in different ways. One player will love what another player find tedious. With a writing excercise like <b>FateClock</b> most players will find it less interesting. That is how it is, and how it should be.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><br/>It also seems to me, though, that identifying their lack as somehow purer than their presence is uncritical romanticism.</blockquote>
<blockquote>No, it's not romanticism. I refer to actual gameplay that have shown itself to be far superior to the gameplay you find in games focused on traditional reward mechanics. I am talking about life-changing gameplay here, nothing less.</blockquote>
"far superior".<br/><br/>Thomas, are you really trying to say that?<br/>That games without reward mechanics, like the ones you've designed, create gameplay FAR SUPERIOR to the gameplay created by reward-mechanic-inclusive games?<br/><br/>That's like saying, "Dogs in the Vineyard, and similar games Vincent Baker has written, produce gameplay that is FAR SUPERIOR to Dungeons and Dragons".<br/>That's like saying "my type of games is FAR SUPERIOR to your type of games".<br/>That's like saying "You are having badwrongfun".<br/><br/>I mean... correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you TRYING to say: "The type of games I've designed ALSO kicks ass, without depending on reward mechanics"?<br/>Or are you actually saying (which is what Ron was trying to get at) that your type of games is PURER (in his words) or FAR SUPERIOR (in your words)?                        </div>

                            A small sidenote: It's the middle of the night over here. I'm sitting alone, and to write of games like Choral, Wormtime and Autumn, is making me raw inside. I feel vulnerable writing about them. The experiences these games have given me is very much a part of me now. By writing about them I evoke an emotional echo of the feelings I've had when playing them.<br/><br/>I do believe that I share these feelings with many Norwegian roleplayers, who have experienced these games too. Not all players have had the profound and personal experiences I'm talking about here, with these games, but most players have had it. That is due to the compelling nature of the methodical tools used in these games. These games don't tease you with rewards, they grab your gut and wring you into action!                        </div>

Okay, so...<br/>I think a fair statement might be: "I've had far superior experiences with Game Type A than I have had with other games that I have played."<br/>It is not fair to continue on to say that "Because my experiences with Game Type A are far superior to my experiences with other game types, they are thus far superior games."<br/><br/>I'm an atheist. Furthermore, I am a nihilist. This works far better FOR ME than any other spiritual viewpoint I've tried to see the world from.<br/>However, it would be plain dumb for me to say that Nihilism is far superior to faith in God.<br/>It is also plain dumb for me to say that Atheism is far superior to Satanism.<br/>I can't make that kind of VALUE JUDGEMENT fairly, ever.<br/>A.) It's about what works for individuals.<br/>B.) I will never ever be wise enough to make absolute statements like that. NO ONE WILL EVER BE.
<blockquote>However: please bear in mind that I have done my share of design of the traditional rpgs, and still do, creating exactly the "lame gameplay" that I talk about here.</blockquote>
Hold the phone.<br/>Why are you making games that produce lame gameplay?<br/><br/>If you hold that one roleplaying stream is FAR SUPERIOR than another, why are you creating FAR INFERIOR games?

Thomas, this is basically my mission statement, to a T, with Boulevard.<br/>But I've been designing with "reward mechanics" in my head.<br/>I'm wondering if we could open up a new thread, where you help teach me how to accomplish these goals?<br/>And where we explore whether more than one type of game can facilitate this kind of experience...<br/><br/>Because it's truly an important matter to me.                        </div>

                            Joe; I appreciate your effort to understand what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I don't see the need to transfer my argument to religion. It pertains to roleplaying games. I hold it to be true. It's based on observations and discussions over a period of twenty years with very active discourse in the field.<br/><br/><b>Why am I making games that produce lame gameplay?</b> Well... I published the frpg Fabula back in 1999, and have supported it since. I'm the single author of it. In Norway we do not have a lot of games in our own language, so I feel obliged to support this game. Some of the modules for Fabula I have been able to turn into something extraordinary (like "Fabula Wormtime"). Not all. Some of them is well within the confines of traditional rpgs. And even though I consider this to be less interesting than my recent design-project (Autumn of Life + ), I hold it to be a great game for youths and oldfashion gamers.<br/><br/>As for opening up a new thread, talking about how to accomplish goals like the ones I've talked about here; NO, sorry, I can't do it. This thread has taken too much time as it has. I have to consentrate on more productive matters now. I've enjoyed the rev/eng challenge, but that was a brief respite from my everyday work as author and games designer.                        </div>

                            Yes, I do believe that roleplaying games are "games of pretend" at the core. I know other "creative agendas" have their qualities too, but when you've had the intense experience of submerging your own personality in the fictional character, then all other ways of gameplay loose a bit of their shine.<br/><br/>I'm not going to translate my games, sorry. I have too much to do.<br/>- Muu is difficult to translate, the poetic-fable language being a very central tool of the game.<br/>- Fabula is too traditional at its core to be interesting in your market.<br/>- Choral is too demanding on the games master to be interesting for anyone but a chosen few.<br/>- Autumn of Life is the first game in a double series of nine + nine rpgs that I am about to write in the years to come. It has not been published yet, only playtested. It may be interesting to translate though, once the series is in publication.<br/><br/>You may find a game of mine in english here:<br/><a href="http://www.fabula.no/pervoEng.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fabula.no/pervoEng.html</a><br/>But be warned: <b>Pervo</b> is an ultra-violent and simple game, not a very sophisticated design at all.                        </div>

                            Synecdoche about Creative Agenda = no chance of this discussion proceeding anywhere useful.<br/>
<br/>
Tomas, as far as I can tell, you posted to bitch about a review you didn't like. Which has nothing to do with anything substantial about rewards or anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I tuned in because it's my terms that are being discussed, but now that I know they <i>aren't</i> being discussed, I don't see much point. If you guys want to try to debate with someone who only wants to slap the table about something emotional and then stand his ground, have a good time.<br/>

Not in my experience, no. Quite the opposite in fact.<br><br>But it would have been nice, preferably in a new thread as some of you suggested, to have some actual play examples, instead of you, Thomas, stating that your games do this and that to the players. It's not exactly substantial, is it? Some of the play experiences you describe sound rather off-putting to me - do players return to the same game saying "Yes! Let's do it again!"?<br><br>But, most importantly: did you get an answer to your initial question?<br><br>Per<br/>(edited for typos)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>I am NOT  trying to say that these games "also kick ass". In my view most roleplaying games do not "kick ass". They produce timeconsuming and lame gameplay most people won't care to explore at all. The games I have listed here produce gameplay with more acute and profound qualities. I have no qualms stating that they produce gameplay of far superior quality. They do.</blockquote>

                            Making money on GMing doesn't seem so far-fetched to me -- a long-ago-friend of mine charges a fee to participate in his Werewolf LARP, for which he does location scouting, mucho preparation, etc. But the fee is very much not a 'cover the costs' thing, it's because he believes he is delivering a superior play experience -- and his players agree.<br/><br/>As for the rest of it, Ron (somewhat predictably) hit the nail on the head.                        </div>

                            First: it may be that Ron has a point. I do not <i>feel</i> very engaged on behalf of FateClock, but it may come out that way anyhow. I see that I piss off a lot of people with my statements. I really don't intend to, even though I know myself to be less than modest about my exploits. I do not believe it is very productive ot create antagonism, so I will consentrate on design. This is my last post in this thread. I try to share...<br/><br/><b>-How to design emotionally gripping games?</b><br/>First advice: Try to explore <b>methodic tools</b>, and keep mechanic tools to a minimum. "Methodic tools" are mostly people-tools. Make game about people, and explore the resources in the people participating. If more than two people participate in a roleplaying game you have resources between you to match an atom bomb. Make use of it!<br/><br/><b>-Making a game work without a reward structure?</b><br/>Choose the right theme for your game, and focus the game on the dramatic potential of that theme. Let the theme give form to your game, not the other way around. A "reward structure" is not a very important thing to think about.<br/><br/><b>-Making money off of GMing?</b><br/>Be a great GM, publish a fantasy rpg and set up a cool poster. Make sure you get paid and do your best to make the players be superpositive in both game and group. I've been GMing professionally since 1995. In periods I had as much as six groups each week paying me for running Fabula. Some of the games have been great fun. Some of them have been more tedious. All of them have helped develop Fabula. Now I run one group, and those players have been with me since -98 (with a small break a couple of years ago). It's mostly for fun, since I get more paid to hold lectures. Do things for fun!<br/><br/>____________________________________________<br/><b>Actual play example:</b><br/><br/>We had a roleplaying salÃ´n tonight, here in Oslo. We tested two rpgs; "InSpectres" (American?) and "Mystique and Dark Deeds" (Norwegian), and ended the evening with an improvised gamesession. This is about the improvisation:<br/><br/>I was chosen to be the GM in the improvisation. We started up at once, no preparations or discussions. Three players, playing childhood friends. One on the beach, alive, the other two angels howering in the air besides him. He don't see or hear them. They don't know why they are there; to help him? Flashback to childhood; them in a scene playing knights. Beach again; him staring out at sea, talking ludly to his friends (still don't know they are there, not knowing they are dead in the war). Flashback to 7th grade; on a school trip, backseat of bus, joking. Beach again; him crying, them wringing their lack of hands. Flashback to them meeting his wife; not successful, conflict. Beach again; him going up to the veranda, them wondering if they possibly is to get help from him, not the other way around, etc...<br/><br/>The game was held in a very calm atmosphere. I led with a minimum of manipulations, mostly setting the mindframe of the game with my calm regie (and leaving most of the regie to the players). Before my eyes the three players played out a stunning drama of moral and friendship. The game ended with the one living character dying, and <b>God</b> (on my initiative) telling him to chose for his friends; <i>Do they go with you to heaven, or do they go to hell?</i> He prayed to God, for himself and his sins, and for the sins of his friends, and then he took his friends with him to heaven: <i>Heavenly Father; they deserve it!</i><br/><br/><b>The end.</b><br/><br/>The game grew from the careful use of a calm voice and deliberate use of one playing card at a time (to signal shifts in the drama, and to feed the interaction with randomly provoked ideas). The establishment of authority is instant because I have no hesitation when setting the game in motion (after being asked). I take control, and then I place total trust with the players. I leave it to them to do internal regie on the scenes, expecting them to create drama through free interaction, and to explore their characters to the very core through the drama. And they naturally do.<br/><br/>We make a gripping drama, starting up, developing it towards the finale, and ending it within 45 minutes.<br/>________________________________________<br/>I hope this example maybe have given some hints on how to achieve the depth of play I am talking about in this thread. Have a good time!                        </div>

<blockquote>First advice: Try to explore methodic tools, and keep mechanic tools to a minimum.</blockquote>
Okay. I guess we're approaching this from different angles. I'm trying to create tools which are both methods and mechanics at once.<br/>For example, Boulevard has cap guns, loaded for Russian Roulette. pointing the gun at someone's head is a METHODIC way to promote tension, but because the cap going off affects that person's character sheet it is also a MECHANICAL way to promote tension.<br/><br/>...Am I wrong in saying "the mechanic given in example above is both"?<br/><br/>Also... the mechanics enforce ranting in-first-person as part of the game.<br/>There are mechanics which govern how a rant is structured... Not to trivialize it, in any way...<br/>But to (a) make ranting accessible to those who aren't prone to ranting in the first place, and (b) to systematically create tension through ranting that is TIED INTO the elements of the game... so that when you rant, the words you say are constantly hitting on stuff that is on the table.<br/><br/>...Are these not mechanical-tools-tied-into-methods?

When you first started charging for RPG sessions, how much did you charge?<br/>What benefits do people get paying for your GMing as opposed to a free game run by ANOTHER great GM?                        </div>

                            I've charged approximately the same all the time. They don't get any benefits from paying me other than that without me thay have no great GM to lead play. I get paid because I believe myself to be a great GM, and because my players believe me to be a great GM too. Those two things are connected like confidence and trust. :-)                        </div>

                            Tomas,<br/><br/>At your request, I've looked back over the conversation and found your response:
<blockquote>I really believe the stated intention of the game; "being a game about investigating humanity, etc..." and the gameplay examples included in the text, to give ample support to a creative agenda. I expect players to follow the instructions of the game, reading it out aloud before play, and so each and every player should be able to see where this lead.</blockquote>
I still need clarification about what you meant. How does this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">support</span> a Creative Agenda of any kind?<br/><br/>A stated intention is not support for a CA. Examples might be, but in this case, I don't see it. Are you saying, because you put examples in the game, players will <i>better</i> be able to play a certain way? I see that it might <i>tell</i> them to play a certain way but I don't see how it will help them do so. That's what I mean by support.<br/><br/>I mean, you could put that kind of advice into any game, even Monopoly, as forcefully as you'd like. It won't make the game support the players for, say, Simulationism or Narrativism in any kind of role-playing sense.                        </div>

                            I've seen a great many discussions like this one with Tomas, on the rpg.net design fora, although eventually people stopped responding to his posts for reasons I suspect are already apparent.<br/><br/>Before that happened though, one interesting fact did come out.  Tomas, with respect to at least one of his games, refused to sell it to anyone who didn't participate in a one day training course with him on how to GM it.<br/><br/>Why does that matter?  Simple, assuming that Tomas does in fact get the results he claims, we have to ask if the rules are actually causative of those results.  If we accept, for the sake of argument, that Tomas is in fact an uber-GM then it may be that what is happening when he passes the game on is not that the rules produce a certain effect, but the GM training day does.<br/><br/>Put another way, it may be that the effects Tomas is seeing have nothing much to do with the rules he is writing, but rather with his personal GMing style.  I also think there are cultural issues, immersionism as the highest form of RPG play is not an unusual idea in Scandinavia as I understand it, and that may create a predisposition to certain gaming experiences that may not travel well outside of that region.<br/><br/>So, I suspect there is a confluence of two factors, a cultural fondness for a certain style of play and individual GMing styles, I suspect the reason that people are not seeing how the rules produce the cited effects is because the rules are not what is generating those effects.<br/><br/>On an aside, Adam, you are using creative agenda in the technical sense.  I don't think Tomas is reading it in the same sense, I think this is partly where the disconnect between you two is occurring, I don't think he is reading those words the same way you are and so when he speaks of creative agendas I don't think he is talking about GNS.  If you notice, you capitalise CAs quite intentionally, he doesn't and I think that is not a function of grammar but of your different uses of the term.                        </div>

I did not, at the time, consider myself able to write the advice necessary to communicate the game as it should be. So I opted for the one-day face-to-face instructions. In my view the alternative was to publish the game and have no players understanding it. It limited the distribution of the game severely, but I am quite proud of both the game and the way I handled it. It was not the consequence of elitism, but rather the consequence of the challenges posed by a truly original game with very subtle social and verbal tools. Today I would have tried to publish it normally, both because I have matured as a writer and the public has more experience in alterative play than back then (Muu was published in -89).<br/><br/><b>- Is the game experiences of my games replicatable?</b><br/>Yes, they are. I do not believe myself to be an "uber-GM", so please don't get all hung up in my high selfesteem. My belief in my own abilities as a GM is paired with a healthy amount of humility, when you meet me face-to-face. Humility and honesty is quite necessary when a GM is trying to win the players trust for a hearthshaking evening of gameplay. However: these days I am into design of GMfree games. <b>Autumn of Life</b> is one of them, the second in a series of 18 games built over the same GMfree method. Muu and Wormtime has had other GMs creating great gameplay too, so the kinds of game experiences that I describe is indeed replicatable. My achievements as a designer does not hinge on my abilities as a GM, no. My games stand very well alone.<br/><br/><b>- I do not design by popular dogma</b><br/>As for the GNS-model: it is not my dogma. I hope no designers make it their dogma. I find it too hung up in rpgs as they were yesterday, and I believe rpg-designers should design for tomorrow. I find that my independent and artistic approach to rpgs opens up for strong design and very ambitious design-goals. I am able to reach some of these goals, and that makes me proud. Whenever I start discussions on it though, the answers tend to be full of scepticism and disbelief. I find it a heavy burden to explain over and over again how my games actually bring a great many players to the rpg-promised heaven of true makebelief and pretend, when having to face waves of scepticism often as laden with narrowmindedness as anything reasonable.<br/><br/><b>- I aim to share</b><br/>I believe "Balbinus" could do me a great service by taking it for granted that this state of things (as he has seen it unfold on RPG.net), has at least as much to do with the special nature of my design-achievements, and how the report of them elicit disbelief, as it has to do with me being arrogant. I admit to not being the most humble of writers, but have no reason to play down my achievements in a forum dedicated to rpgs and the design of them. I sincerely believe that by saying how far I have reachied in my design and GMing, I may inspire other to reach for the stars too. I believe "Balbinus" will do himself a service too, if he acted in a more generous manner towards socially inept guys like me.<br/><br/>- to be continued...                        </div>

<b>- A small comment on FateClock</b><br/>Adam claim that the lack of a "reward mechanic" in Fateclock make the game fall flat in his view. I believe the game fail to engage him by its other faults, partly because I do not agree with the assumption that each and every rpg need to have a "reward mechanic". Such an assumption is so weird in my view, that I had to get the statement verified before I dared to say anything against it. A "reward mechanic" is not a godgiven element of rpgs. It hardly belongs there at all, in my view. That was the reason for this thread. As for the creative agenda, and the lack of support for it; I maintain that it has support in the text of the game, although not a very great support. I leave the game FateClock to its own destiny in that respect. In my view FateClock is deserving the grade Adam gave it (a total of 19, I believe). It is a mediochre design, in my view. I have stated this before, but I am doing it again, to the benefit of those believing that my writings here is in defence of that game. This discussion is not about FateClock. It has in fact little to do with that game.<br/><br/><b>- Ron Edwards; my nemesis ;-)</b><br/>I do not find that the term "reward system", as defined by Ron Edwards, to be very useful, although it tries to open up for thinking on other issues than the mechanics. As the term include the word "system", it is laden with the possibilies of misreading, as this discussion has clearly demonstrated. "System" is a word closely related to "rules" and "mechanics" in the field of rpgs. So it is not a great way of opening up for alternative thinking on rpg-design. To use the word "system" in any theoretical rpg-term not directly linked with mechanics, is to invite misinterepretations of the term. The other word of the term: "reward", has the same possibilities of creating misunderstandings and skewed thinking, in my view. It supports the idea that you have to treat your players as dogs under training, in order to reach any level of great gameplay. The gamesystem and/or the GM has to "reward" the behaviour you like to have, in some way other than through the drama it enables you to create, and the experiences associated with said drama. That is SO not true.<br/><br/><b>Sidenote:</b> and this is said by me, a GM known for treating my players like dogs (read the rpg Pervo to see how "doggy" you can treat your players, freely awailable at: www.fabula.no/pervoeng.html). I refrain from using the term Edwards has created. "Reward system" is not a term that supports a real understanding of rpgs. In the end I believe it to be a snare for your thinking, rather than a stepping stone.<br/><br/><b>- The deep pretend of an adult</b><br/>My experience is quite contrary to the belief of "doggy-style rpg'ism" (sorry, could not leave that one alone). The drama has its own qualities, and to get there is not a question of "rewards"; it is a question of effective tools and the stirring of creative powers in the players. I believe that I achieve some of my more ambitious design goals on the sole basis that I acknowledge this: children play games of pretend. They do it for years, installing themselves with very great abilities in <i>how to be another person</i>. When you pair the sleeping ability of an adult to play games of pretend, with their experience of the world and human beings, you get a player of possible characters that are inherently great. All you have to do as a designer it to stirr their sleeping abilities, and to engage their most profound experiences as human beings. It is very hard to achieve as a designer, but when it occurs it has the apparition of being a very simple and straightforward thing. Gameplay witin a sphere based on these two elements are as flowing and changeable as a river.<br/><br/><b>- Less is more</b><br/>To conclude: a creative agenda can be supported by mechanical means, yes, but it may as well be supported by a specific lack of mechanical tools in gameplay. In some roleplaying games less is more.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>

I think that can be true, if a game is designed with certain underlying assumptions about unspoken elements.  For example, a game may include no rules for intrigue because it is an unspoken assumption that intrigue will be purely an issue for social rather than mechanical resolution.  This is why it is easy to go wrong saying "game x is about y, because it has rules for y".<br/><br/>For a thematic game though, a game designed to produce not a potential range of play experiences but a particular play experience I would have thought it better to have rules clearly designed to help produce that experience.<br/><br/>Put another way, I can shape Runequest for example to play a dungeonbash, a game of intrigue, a courtly romance or whatever.  The rules don't support some of those things, but the game is easily adapted to them and holds up fine in the doing.  The lack of support is in a way a strength, as it allows me to easily morph it into whatever it is I particularly want to do.  If having a range of potential experiences is what I am looking for, too much support for any one thing or too strong a rules focus on one experience may undermine my play objectives.<br/><br/>But, if from the outset a game is designed with a particular end in mind, for example courtly romance, then it seems a bit odd to expect the user to morph it.  If that is what the game is for, and that is why the user bought it, it seems reasonable for them to expect it to support courtly romance straight out of the box.<br/><br/>If I understand correctly, the point being made is that that support may be robust, yet not present in the actual mechanics.  That may be so, but how is it achieved in practice?                        </div>

                            Tomas, <br/><br/>On my reading of your posts, it still seems that you see immersionism as in some sense the highest form of roleplaying.  You use terms like "the deep pretend of an adult" or "the rpg-promised heaven of true makebelief and pretend".<br/><br/>As Thunder_God correctly states, not everyone has those as their goals.  This is what I was trying to get at in talking about cultural issues, my impression (and I am happy to be corrected) is that there is a significant strand in Scandinavian rpg theory which holds immersionism as a higher form of rp.  That is not a view commonly held outside Scandinavia, indeed many query whether it is a meaningful creative agenda at all (personally I think it is, but I entirely recognise that many do not agree with me on that).<br/><br/>That seems to me partly where this is breaking down, you're talking about games that enhance immersion through non-mechanical means (and intrusive mechanics certainly can damage immersion).  That is a fascinating topic, and if you have insights into how immersion can be enhanced I think many would be interested in them, but for a lot of people immersion isn't really a goal they aim for or particularly important to their play.                        </div>

Well, boardgames also have rules but I don't see the term as connected to those games.  Almost all games have rules, cardgames do as well for example.<br/><br/>As for using it with care in relation to roleplaying games, I was.  That was why I was drawing a distinction between mechanics and other material, but I find the idea one shouldn't use the term rules in relation to RPGs a bit silly, it's an ordinary English usage.<br/><br/>I think I may bail, the problem is that your responses are so general that they are impossible to engage with.  Methodic advice, fine, but what kind of methodic advice?  There is nothing there that could help me or anyone else design a game, it's just too vague.<br/><br/>It's like if I said that if you want a courtly romance rpg then you should carefully consider the art in your game.  That may or may not be true, but either way it gives no clue as to what I recommend actually doing by way of art.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>If I understand correctly, the point being made is that that support may be robust, yet not present in the actual mechanics.</blockquote>Yes, you understand me correctly. I am sorry, but I cannot begin to explain how to achieve this in your design. My own design is all about it, but the main part of it is in Norwegian. I point in that direction in the hope that some crazy would-be designer goes into land unknown...<br/><br/>"Thunder_God": in roleplaying games you willl have drama, if I understand that the term is as general in English as in Norwegian; any kind of narrative involving conflict, as described in one of the "dramatic artforms" (literature, theatre, film, and rpgs). So you may not have roleplaying games without drama. You don't have to focus at "drama" as such, but if you have conflicts in your game the game is producing some sort of drama. I aim for a sort of drama that takes you out of yourself, and leave you to defend the intergrity of a strange character. :-)                        </div>

                            Tomas, when I read your posts here, what I see is:<br/><br/>* System doesn't matter<br/>* Immersion is the be-all, end-all<br/>* The GM is God<br/>* Actor stance, actor stance, actor stance<br/>* Getting to play is its own reward<br/>* Illusionism<br/><br/>This is especially reinforced when I read the Pervo link you provided. The one rule in that game seems to be that you roll a die against a stat that the GM determined, and the result is whatever the GM says, regardless of that stat or the roll. The descriptions of the other games on your resume seem pretty similar, in varying degrees.<br/><br/>Maybe I am exaggerating, but that's how your posts read to me. Given that this forum was, to a certain extent, brithed out of the Forge, and the Forge (as I understand the theory developed there) points to almost everything I listed above as primary sources of incoherent and even dysfunctional play, I think you have to expect a certain amount of push-back and even disbelief when discussing your design methodology and style of play...<br/><br/>...especially when it's mixed with talk of your getting paid to GM and offer workshops, and of players so thoroughly in awe of your games. Personally, it throttles my imagination.<br/><br/>I would honestly love to hear a podcast of one of your sessions. I guess I'd have to speak Norweigan, though, huh? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>... there is a significant strand in Scandinavian rpg theory which holds immersionism as a higher form of rp.</blockquote>Yes, there is a fair share of designers who are into "immersionism" over here, but most designers in Scandinavia are not. The picture is not so simple. Each country has its own tradition, and not all of them are easily translated into the same picture.<br/><br/>I am truly sorry not being able to be more specific about how to develop methodical tools. I would like to do so, and have done it in Norwegian. However: to translate such tools is too demanding on my time, so I can't live up to that challenge. Sorry!<br/><br/>I know a lot of people say that they don't want deep character submersion and/or engaging drama. OK. I don't know if they are at all aware of what they are talking about, but it is fine with me that players and designers want to go their own way (or the way of everybody else). In my games most players go my way, and my games are known to deliver them into more conflicts, more engagement, more excitement and more shared joy. It's all about getting <b>more</b> out of the roleplaying. How can you be opposed to that!?                        </div>

                            Tomas,<br/><br/>I'm not really opposed to anything in this thread, however at the end of the day if you cannot give any specifics at all about the stuff you are talking about then it is hard to see what people can do with it.<br/><br/>There is apparently a great way of writing and running games, if we understood it it would help our games, however despite numerous posts you don't have the time to explain it in any meaningful way (though ample time to restate how great it is).  That's your right, but it follows that there is nothing really to discuss.<br/><br/>Ron had the right of it, he can be annoying that way, there's no discussion here as there is no subject for discussion.  We have no topic.<br/><br/>I'm out.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>* Immersion is the be-all, end-all</blockquote>No, certainly not, but it is surely a lot-more of a great deal of things related to you trying to play a character in relation to other PCs.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>* The GM is God</blockquote>In Pervo, yes, but my recent design is GMfree.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>* Actor stance, actor stance, actor stance</blockquote>That is, in fact, something I advice strongly against! the player is not an actor, and should not strive to become one, or to take any kind of stance that could be construed to be actor'ish.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>* Getting to play is its own reward</blockquote>Yes, of course: all work and no play is a life squandered!
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>* Illusionism</blockquote>Eh... you have to have a certain degree of suspension of disbelief to play a roleplaying game to its full potential, yes (I'm not sure if I understand you).<br/><br/>To be paid to GM is a trivial matter, in my view.                        </div>

                            Balbinus: your questions about how my ideas transport into actual design is as hopeless for me to answer as the question about what my latest novel is "actually all about". Read the book, is my answer. In this forum I am at a loss how to give you a constructive answer. Any explanation I could give would fall short of the actual design, so I have to limit myself to hints and pointers. Please don't be angry with me for writing things here that means the world to me, and not supporting my statements with real design-examples. I am really sorry for it!                        </div>

                            Tomas,<br/><br/>If I ask a writer what his book is about, it is entirely within his rights not to wish to explain but to simply ask me to read it.<br/><br/>However, the likely corollary, given that I have limited time, is that I will instead read books by writers prepared to give me some clue what their books are about.  Reading a book takes time, my time is at a premium, there are many great works of literature where I can get in advance some idea of what the book is about or what themes it treats.<br/><br/>Similarly, with games.  I go to the gamestore with my money in my pocket, I see the games there, I haven't time or money for all of them.  So, I go on what I've heard about them, what I have seen recommended, what I know of subject matter and thematic content.  I don't buy at random with my eyes closed.<br/><br/>I'm not angry, just a touch frustrated as you seem to have something interesting to say but never quite say it.  Really, it's about use.  A statement that game x provides a great experience is fine, but I can't do anything with it.  It gives me no meaningful information, similarly if I say that Ismail Kadare is a great writer that of itself communicates little of any use.  As a potential reader, I have given you no clues as to whether his works would interest you or not or be worth your time.<br/><br/>So by all means post about how great your games are or how they provide great experiences, that's your right, but for that information to actually be useful it is necessary to delve into the mud of practicality, to say in concrete ways why they are great or how they provide great experiences.  You can choose not to, but that carries a cost and the cost is that great as all that stuff may be none of it can be used.                        </div>

                            Hmmm. I'm seeing a blockage here. Hopefully this will serve as some Drain-O:<br/><br/>Between THIS, which I empathize with:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>I'm not angry, just a touch frustrated as you seem to have something interesting to say but never quite say it.  Really, it's about use.

As a potential reader, I have given you no clues as to whether his works would interest you or not or be worth your time.</blockquote>
And THIS, which I totally agree with:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>To conclude: a creative agenda can be supported by mechanical means, yes, but it may as well be supported by a specific lack of mechanical tools in gameplay. In some roleplaying games less is more.</blockquote>
What I smell here is training people to be GMs through... well... face to face training, rather than what's written in the book.  You can do this somewhat through GM Advice in a book. You can also try to get people on the ball through triggering stuff up in the rules.<br/><br/>There may be merit in developing this idea further; a way to train people to be better GMs in the book, through something like Very Focused GM advice, perhaps even a "workbook" of sorts that the GM goes through as they play their games ("Did you use description of details to enhance at least three scenes? Y/N"). There's some stuff in there that's ripe for exploration.<br/><br/>However, Tomas finds that this kind of stuff is transmitted better/faster in face to face training, which is also a cool idea, albeit one that doesn't sit well with people like in the US, where their purchase base is all over the country, or planet. Therefore we want to make explanations and GM advice as plain as possible in the book (or omit it altogether, expecting the GM to be pretty competent from the get-go; or bring up rules to trigger these sorts of Good GM Behaviors).<br/><br/>And that's the disconnect: It seems that Balbinus wants more of this "how to make games into great experiences" info, and Tomas really can't break it down further in text, because he does all his stuff face-to-face in train-the-trainer style environments. Plus the fact that it'd take him too long to convert a face-to-face seminar into text. So I guess we'll have to move on on this point, and take the interesting ideas that developed from this thread and start new threads with them.<br/><br/>Oh, here's a bit of a witticism which adds some weight perhaps to what Tomas was talking about: The RPG <b>DREAD: The First Book of Pandemonium</b> (originally released about 3 years ago or so, and will be re-released next year). You saw something awesome with this game by the people who read it:<br/><br/>* People who read or tried to play DREAD after just experiencing the book almost all agreed that the game sucked, or was fundamentally broken, or at least flawed in ways (suffered lots of "See Page XX", rules that referenced other rules that didn't exist, rules that brought up questions that weren't answered, etc).<br/>* People who read or tried to play DREAD after being in a game session at a Con with Rafael (the creator), or after being in a session with someone who PLAYED in a session with Rafael, had a VERY different opinion of the game: "It's the best horror game, period" "The game rocks", etc. <br/><br/>Thing is, in a face to face session Rafael was conveying a WHOLE lotta shit that never made its way into the book, mostly "GM advice" sorts of things:<br/><br/>* Plan very little in advance.<br/>* What you do plan shouldn't necisserily be plot triggers, but rather gruesome/cool things that the players should see.<br/>* Visceral descriptions of lots of little details.<br/>* Really ham up accents, especially country accents. Drop the F-Bomb when needed, while looking the player straight in the eyes.<br/>* Give immediate, constant verbal encouragement ("Dude, that's AWESOME"  &lt;--- It may seem simple/dumb, but at the time I'd never been in a game where the GM or other players constantly gave so much positive feedback).<br/><br/>That sort of thing. There are probably about 5-10 more lessons that I took away from playing DREAD with Rafael that I put into my own games, stuff that I probably am not even cognicent of (but if we found it, we could recreate it in text or training).  <br/><br/>So anyway, I understand where Tomas is coming from on that point.  It is easier and faster to do train-the-trainer style consulting (or, alternately, just "running an adventure" for players, and breaking it up at points saying "Hey, so did you see what I did there? This is a great tool to run this game...") than to put the time and effort into putting those notes into "GMs Advice".  If there's a better way to convey it through text, no one has tried it yet (but may be that "workbook" method I mentioned).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>This is especially reinforced when I read the Pervo link you provided. The one rule in that game seems to be that you roll a die against a stat that the GM determined, and the result is whatever the GM says, regardless of that stat or the roll. The descriptions of the other games on your resume seem pretty similar, in varying degrees.</blockquote>
Someone pointed me, a long time ago, to thread in Forge in which someone draw a diagram of immersionist/elÃ¤ytyjivism (Turku School was the buzz back then) and narrative-oriented, mechanically heavy games having evoluted from "traditional games" as opposing styles of playing. This kind of strikes true for me; both try to solve the perceived problems of traditional roleplaying games by different means - the first ones by ditching almost all game-like things, the second one by reinforcing  them. I could be way off here, but I'm thinking that especially the Scandinavian immersive playing (which could or could not be what Thomas is pushing) tries to change the playing culture in a way where the Dysfunctional Spookywords don't apply or can be used in positive way, and the narrative-oriented games try to eliminate the same things with strict mechanics and structured play. Both kind of succeed, but being polar opposites (almost), the methods used in other end don't really make sense in the other end.                        </div>

                            Andy: your post is great! One thing only: I do not prefer to make face-to-face instructions on how to play my games, but had to do it once, due to a perceived lack of writing ability and a very demanding game. I've learned a good deal since then, but my writing is mostly in Norwegian, and certainly the most subtle of it.<br/><br/>Balbinus: I try to give clues, but it would be far better for you to have clues to games you actually could try out yourself. I do understand that, but there's not a lot to do about it. Consider my ramblings as clues to how other traditions of rpg-design may uncover other interesting venues of design, and try to follow the directions on your own, if you find the clues interesting.                        </div>

                            Merten, yes, but not really.<br/><br/>Now, part of the issue here is the reward cycle / reward mechanism distinction, which is important.  However, Tomas has also got this mechanics vs "methodical tools" thing going on, which I'm not sold on.  Mechanics <em>are</em> methodical tools, and vice-versa, unless Tomas is laboring under the conception that mechanics entail rolling dice or spending resources off of a character sheet.<br/><br/>All games, whether they come out of Forgish Indie or Nordic or Mainstream D&amp;D books, have a reward cycle.  The reward cycle is built out of things that the players do at the table.  Assuming players do these things in a consistent way, these things they do are game procedures.  The question, for me, comes down to whether or not the players get these procedures from the game book or from some other source.  Writing something down on your character sheet or rolling dice is irrelevant, here.  The text provides the procedures for the reward cycle or it doesn't.<br/><br/>If FateClock doesn't include those procedures, well then, it doesn't include those procedures.  There are lots of other places to get reward cycles to apply to the FateClock text.  The catch, however, is that the more things I have to get from elsewhere and apply to the text, the less I actually need the text.                        </div>

                            Merten: you may be on to something; two different traditions being so different in basic philosophy and terminology that it makes communication between their designers quite difficult.<br/><br/>The difference of "Forge-games" and my kind of games is clearly there. I have not tried a whole lot of your indie-games, but have had a lot of reports from designers and players who have done so. Of those few I have tried, PTA has been best, even though it makes something quite different with rpgs than what I try to do. I consider <b>Primetime Adventures</b> to be a truly great game in the american indie-tradition, but it still has not managed to create the profoundly meaningful coexistence of player and character that I prefer to create, while at the same time keeping the game and its drama steamrolling. As far as I can see PTA don't try to do that at all, but instead try to take the group into a kind of shared fiction where the shiftings of storyteller-rights are essential to how the game play out, and do this to the effect of creating drama with lots of qualities, without the depht of character I consider the true hearth of my greatest achievements. In my view this makes PTA a superbly wrought storyteller game, and I have played it as such (twice, and would love to do it again). As I have not played a lot of other "Forge-games" though, it may be that I speak of ignorance in regards to what the indie-game tradition represents.<br/><br/>I do know that a great deal of the designers dedicated to the Forge are sharp minds who can argue my trousers off anyday. I discuss rpgs with them with my ears eager for any word of wisdom, and find wisdom in their posting each and every time I read them. Ron Edwards is one of the most thoughtprovocing of the lot, in my view. It don't follow that they are better game designers than I am, though. ;-)                        </div>

I totally agree with you. Recently I have todl myself to stop designing games for players, and rather focus my design on how to get <b>people</b> playing my games. It has kind of delivered me from the shackles of gamism. The effect is great! My ability to make innovative rpg-design is growing as ever before!

                            I've tried to stay out of this, particulary since I hold little regard for Tomas as a forum poster (we've banged heads one time too many and never pretty).<br/>
<br/>
However, now that this is said, there is one thing that needs to be said in his defence.<br/>
<br/>
Some of his methodical techniques work and I have been using moany of them for ages before I found the Forge, or forumlife at all. Some of them are not so great and to my personal tastes sink too far into hippy-bongo land.<br/>
<br/>
Tomas is very focused on the Game-leader (Direct translation of the current norwegian word for GM) as a Leader. At times this borders on monomaical, but mainly he asks players who like to wear this mantle to step up and take charge.<br/>
He has a lot of immersionist aiding tools such as a combination of gestures/bodylanguage assosiated with Fabula-magic (Fabula being the game of all games if you believe him) and having the player next to you roll the dice for you. An example of this is having the player grab his crotch to show how that kind of magic is making him horny. Or techniques where the LEADER describes flashes of a battle, giving the players seconds to react to partial information given only to thorw the atrocities the characters have commited in the players face once the characters have time to reflect what they are doing.<br/>
He has also spent time trying to develop a set of techniques to facilitate and encourage active participation of all the players. Advice like greeting everyone with a firm handshake and to meet their eyes to everyone sitting around the table, holding hands chanting we will look stupid but that is okay.<br/>
<br/>
Now for some people this is the bomb.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time he has rejected most of the terms that have come out of the Forge (you should have seen the fights we have had over the Lumpley-principle or terms like authority). We'll keep it nice and say that he is no fan.<br/>
<br/>
But in between the immense hubris and the posting style of pitbull on amphetamines he has some important points.<br/>
I've touched on some of them above, the list is much much longer. But he has to ve the one to share them.<br/>
<br/>
And even if immersionism isn't really your thing, there are things here that can and will provide and effect. And I belive that combining some of them with or into mechanics will give very strong thematic play.<br/>
<br/>
So Tomas, give them a few more sample, in particular your class spheres from Fabula.<br/>
The people here would love to see them.                        </div>

Note that I mentioned the reward mechanism (which, if I read Ron's definition earlier in this thread right, is some kind of structure or rule which rewards the players), not reward cycle/reward system.

Which kind of makes sense, since there is no active player-self that could or should be rewarded during the play.<br><br>I'm not sure about the methods vs mechanics -distinction, in general. They could be roughly the same thing, but it's a huge issue and I don't really know how to approach it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Well, now that you put it that way, it makes sense. If you consider immersing to be kind of a reward loop (where reward is the feeling of, well, being immersed), I guess you get back all the time. I don't know if the after-effect that the player-self experiences can be considered to be a reward then, or just an additional bonus.
<blockquote>As for the Mechanic/Cycle thing, you're not getting what I'm saying.

Okay, I'll buy that. It'd be a bitch to write that down in a game as some kind of mechanic (not limited to dice rolling and character sheets). Which, then again, could be one of the reasons why (published) games with such rewards don't exist.                        </div>

I think, and this is my interpetation of this, not his, that the idea with the player next to you rolling the dice for you is so that the act of rolling the die does not interfer with your narration of the act then outcome. It is a fortune in the middle thing combined with an attempt to create a feeling of mystique to magic.<br/>
<br/>
The argument being that mechanically defining magic takes away som of the ... eh .. magic? So he goes for some freeform narration combined with a FitM bit to see if you must narrate success or failure.<br/>
<br/>
Have not seen any AP thread whether this works or not.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Merten</cite><br>As for the Mechanic/Cycle thing, you're not getting what I'm saying.  You and Tomas and everyone else has reward "mechanics" as long as you are accessing the reward cycle through reliable, consistent means.  The in-character trance that keeps getting pointed at, for instance, could easily be referred to as a reward mechanic.  It's the thing you do, and do over and over, to get enjoyment out of the game.  Limiting "mechanics" to "dice and character sheets" is really, really, needlessly limiting.</br></blockquote>
Okay, I'll buy that. It'd be a bitch to write that down in a game as some kind of mechanic (not limited to dice rolling and character sheets). Which, then again, could be one of the reasons why (published) games with such rewards don't exist.<br><br>That, right there, seems to be crux of the matter.  The Forge school (and most current American indie schools) focus on how the rules text can reinforce a certain style of play.  For myself, that seems to be the game's job, and if it isn't accomplishing it, I see that as a failure of the game-as-published.  (As opposed to a failed published game.)   <br><br>On the very other hand, it seems like the Scandinavian schools focus on finding a style of play and reinforcing it directly, possibly by training all players in very specific techniques.  In some ways, my limited exposure to Scandinavian play reminds me of improv or Method acting and dominance/submission play.  I don't know how much that demonstrates a fledgling comprehension or a novitiates confusion.  But I'm certainly at a loss about how one would write a game text, publish and sell it in good conscience, except perhaps the way that Strasberg might publish a book on The Method.<br><br>(I'm personally curious about how current the Turku manifesto is &amp;emdash; in other words, is it a beloved relic, or modern thought?  And especially Tomas's opinion of it.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Thunder_god: please don't praise Kaare for spreading his misconceptions about what I do as a GM, or what my games are about. His description of "my" techniques is one I only remotely reckognise myself in. I don't think he has ever played one of my games. His description of the one Wormtime-technique on how to stress players, could as well be one of hearsay as anything else. His derivative way of describing it certainly do not leave the specific technique much honor, and is certainly not taking into consideration the methodical apparatus at your disposal in this module to Fabula.<br/><br/>His challenge to me regarding Fabula; to divulge more of the "class-spheres", is not one I could adhere to. The said spheres was an experimental technique related to the traditional frpg Fabula, developed openly on a Norwegian rpg-forum, but it was left as dysfunctional last winter. I doubt that I will take it up again. If Kaare find it interesting and would like to develop it, he may do so, as it was posted in an open thread (free for Norwegian designers or GMs to grab). My testing of the technique revealed it to be flawed. It took too much player-focus from the character.<br/><br/>Kaares remark about the "crouch-grabbing" is one taken from a thread on the same forum. The thread was a general speculation on methodic tools, and it had several contributors. None of the possible tools invented there had or have anything to do with my games. Kaare may freely translate them, and post them here, but please do not construe it to have anything to do with my games.

Your writing is very close to the points I've tried to make, and help me to deeper understanding of them.<br/><br/>However: you also fail the mark, in my view, here:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>The in-character trance that keeps getting pointed at, for instance, could easily be referred to as a reward mechanic.

I am not at all interested in putting gameplay of this type into the context created by the term "reward system" (or the term "reward cycle"). I'd rather see new terms more on target, and with less of the loss of substance that this term create. The thing we discuss is, as you pointed out above, a subtle design and gameplay strategy. Once you experience this way of gaming, it is deceptively simple. It is only remotely connected to anything that could be called a "reward system", so please try to find another handle on it.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>... it seems like the Scandinavian schools focus on finding a style of play and reinforcing it directly, possibly by training all players in very specific techniques. </blockquote>this is a misconception of the "scandinavian shcool". It is mostly based on larp-practise in Norway, Finland and Sweden. Larp is something quite different from rpgs in our countries. Larp has developed into a form of its own.<br/><br/>My focus, and the focus of other rpg-designers in Scandinavia, is on how the gametext can reinforce a certain style of play. Some of us do, however, have a radically different take on this than the indie-scene in America. I am very sorry that the language barrier stop me from relateing this to you in detail, but on the other hand: without the language barrier there may not have been an independent shcool of design in Norway. And I am very proud of what I, and my fellow Norwegian designers, have managed to create of innovative design in recent years.                        </div>

Dude, that sharing of information has been the single useful thing in this thread.<br/>Kaare showed us cool, interesting, different stuff.<br/>You haven't.<br/><br/>You've repeatedly told us your stuff is really good, but you are too busy to tell us about it.<br/>Seriously. If you want to clear misconceptions, tell us about stuff you do. And stop being so goddam confrontational.<br/>We want to learn what stuff you do is cool. Tell us.

Tomas,<br/>It really would be awesome if you would lay out a concrete example of what you're talking about.  If you're actually seeking to be left alone on this thread, it would help wrap things up.  As it stands, just saying "no, that's not what my game is about.  I'm brilliant!  Read my games.  Oh, they're in Norwegian, sorry," is just tantalizing.  I for one want to <em>see</em> this brilliance!                        </div>

Thomas, it's EXACTLY those clues we are asking for. And I am not sure why you can't convey them to us, with examples from real-life play situations. You must have been in many. You must think about what you are doing before, during and after you are playing.<br/><br/>If it's a language problem, no problem, I understand Norwegian, and you will probably understand my Danish. We can do it aside this forum if you feel you have something to contribute, and I'll try to pass it on or whatever.<br/><br/>But until now, all I see is you say you have some amazing, fantastic, mind-boggling and player-grapping ideas and procedures, but you cannot (or won't, I'm not sure) describe how they work. That sounds fairly old-school to me. Most of the games I bought in the 90s and 80s had EXACTLY that feature.<br/><br/>Per<br/>Hvad er det nu det norske rollespilsforum hedder?                        </div>

                            Dude, I try to give you cred and you still spit all over me.<br/>
<br/>
Your choice.<br/>
<br/>
It was the most progressive sh.. i've seen from you for a while. The whole idea was in my opinion* a method where in the players were given more authorship over their class role within party play, in an attempt to create ... in Norwegian: <i>Jeg er ute etter Ã¥ forskyve balansen mellom spiller og spilleder, slik at spilleren sitter igjen med mer definisjonsmakt over sin rolle i visse situasjoner.</i> translated with loss: I am looking to change the blaance between the player and the game-leader so that the player is left with more content authority over his character in certain situations.<br/>
<br/>
This manifested in "green cards" where in the player was given the right to introduce into the SIS things that fitted into the class' sphere of influence. For instance the "bard" class had the right to introduce NPCs in any town or underworld (criminal) setting, introduce taverns and inns, have a relationship to any NPC in town and so forth. If this failed the original intention I really can't be the judge. And given there were some issues with regards to two players sharing authority over a sphere.<br/>
I still can not see how this may end up in this
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">It took too much player-focus from the character.</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
But I guess thats where the whole immersion issue comes in. But seeing as you no longer talk to us, this whole point is moot.<br/>
<br/>
This could be an excellent hack for a DnD game, among other things.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>On the very other hand, it seems like the Scandinavian schools focus on finding a style of play and reinforcing it directly, possibly by training all players in very specific techniques.  In some ways, my limited exposure to Scandinavian play reminds me of improv or Method acting and dominance/submission play.  I don't know how much that demonstrates a fledgling comprehension or a novitiates confusion.  But I'm certainly at a loss about how one would write a game text, publish and sell it in good conscience, except perhaps the way that Strasberg might publish a book on The Method.</blockquote>
I think you're on the right track; Scandinavian play (and I mean the character-immersive, close-to-LARP -play here - there's a wide variety of playing styles here and that's just one subset) tends to be built upon a common social contract and the style of play emerging from that. I'm no method actor, but it seems to be very similar - and perhaps has some elements from dominance/submission -play (though mostly just the connection between player and character, not the dominance-aspects). We rarely do games, but we do a lot of scenarios (one-shots, short campaigns, long campaigns). There's really no (perceived) need of rules text reinforcing certain style of play, since the reinforcement already comes from the social contract and roleplaying culture.<br><br>Roughly put, I'd think there could be two kind of different books published. One would be something akin to <i>Beyond Role and Play</i> and the most concrete articles of it, or like Juhana Pettersson's very mis-titled <i>Roleplaying Manifesto</i> (in Finnish only) which is, aside from a RPG history lesson, a kind of toolbox-book with techniques for using group dynamics, setting the scene, describing, writing characters, etc. That's for people who already share the style of play which the book assumes - and it assumes a lot, since it covers both the tabletop and live-roleplaying aspects.<br><br>Another possibility would be a traditional out-of-the-box book, which would probably have to start with the social contract, what it is, why it is, how it's used, how to play with it and so on. I dunno, it could have a prepared scenario or something, but since the Scandinavian style mostly is about GM/larpwrights creating scenarios, it sounds a bit odd.<br><br>I'm not familiar with stuff Thomas has done, so can't comment if it fits this assumption.
<blockquote>(I'm personally curious about how current the Turku manifesto is &amp;emdash; in other words, is it a beloved relic, or modern thought?  And especially Tomas's opinion of it.)</blockquote>
I'm prone to think that the manifesto's and dogma's were a product of their time (late 90's) and we've since moved away from trying to present things by, ahem, challenging the readers with preaching. But at least around here, the "traditional" character-immersive playing style is very much built upon the ideals of Turku Manifesto, perhaps excluding the GM-is-all -approach of it. In other words, the style of play hasn't changed much from style of mid-90's, which then influenced the manifesto those wacky west coasters wrote.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>* People who read or tried to play DREAD after just experiencing the book almost all agreed that the game sucked, or was fundamentally broken, or at least flawed in ways (suffered lots of "See Page XX", rules that referenced other rules that didn't exist, rules that brought up questions that weren't answered, etc).<br>* People who read or tried to play DREAD after being in a game session at a Con with Rafael (the creator), or after being in a session with someone who PLAYED in a session with Rafael, had a VERY different opinion of the game: "It's the best horror game, period" "The game rocks", etc. <br><br>Thing is, in a face to face session Rafael was conveying a WHOLE lotta shit that never made its way into the book, mostly "GM advice" sorts of things:<br><br>* Plan very little in advance.</br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>
Actually, I do a lot of planning in advance.  However, it's all open-ended.  I try to create open-ended scenarios that the players can approach from numerous angles, and so I wind up creating a lot of content that is never experienced by the group.<br><br>I think that by familiarizing myself with the material beforehand, I'm better equipped to "wing it" during a game.  And I do improvise a lot.  But it's not all off-the-cuff.<br><br/>Most of this is covered in Chapter 6 (of the first edition), but there will probably be more detail in the revised edition (because I've had four years of gaming experience since the first edition came out).<br/><br/>Sorry to derail the thread!<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </br></br></br></div>
