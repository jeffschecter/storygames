And a chinese name captioning a photo of a Barak Obama-looking guy, of indiscernable actual race, who -might- be wearing yellow facepaint.  An actual black guy in cornrows, holding a paper fan, in kung-fu attire, using the name "Shen".<br/><br/>There's green facepaint, feline facepaint, elf ears, scottish tartan and blue Braveheart facepaint, "Templars" with christian crosses on their tunics.  An Egyptian mummy.  A "demon" in Darth Maul facepaint.  Muslim turbans and veils.<br/><br/>There's a group photo in pitch-black "dark elf" facepaint, mostly whites-- but one black guy, too.<br/><br/>Is there a difference between playing these characters "live", as opposed to tabletop?<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>If the Knight Realms community faced criticism-- in the vein of Chris Chinn calling Drow cosplay "blackface", or Story Games members analyzing the orientalist Jabba The Hutt image as "racist"-- then the KR members would be faced with an Identity Politics quandry.<br/><br/>I am visualizing myself in that position.  <br/><br/>Would my membership-by-choice in the Knight Realms community-- trump my membership by blood in an actual racial group depicted, perhaps clumsily or offensively, by KR?   <br/><br/>Would my distaste for sanctimonious finger-pointing critics-- trump the fact that such critics' arguments may nonetheless have merit?  <br/><br/>What about my pro-art/ pro-fantasy identity: I believe in exploration and articulation of subconscious impulses and desires... that's the only way I know to learn what each of us really wants.  And yet the long journey to self-discovery make take some of us into unpleasant territory, and we may be appalingly lax about bothering to outgrow those wrong turns.  How much slow-learning should I tolerate?<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>Apply this to the Story Games Community. What does it take for a member to win your support?  Is it enough if they're dedicated to making or playing these games?  Or must they also pass some additional litmus test:  in effect prioritizing some other identity politics you have embraced ahead of membership here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61407/#Comment_61407" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-17T19:21:17+00:00" title="March 17, 2007  7:21PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's "membership" here?<br/><br/>I would not be a part of any group willing to have me as a member.<br/><br/>They clearly have low standards and associate with inappropriate persons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61456/#Comment_61456" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T16:30:00+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  4:30PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2007 4:36PM by Call Me Curly.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been asked in a whisper what I want from this thread.<br/><br/>When Jabba's moustache was being discussed, I twice spent over an hour-- trying to put my thoughts into words.<br/><br/>--pointless re-iteration of Jabba the Hutt thread edited for brevity ----<br/><br/>I discussed this stuff with co-workers and friends.<br/>When I followed the link to KnightRealms.com, from the 'Get Your Larp On Northeast' discussion, identity politics implications obviously<br/>were still lingering in my head.<br/><br/>Days later, I felt like I had words for my own point of view.  So I began this discussion. The Knight Realms was a focal lens, like when an Actual Play example is given to avoid overly-hypothetical go-nowhere discussions.   The unresolved multiplicity of my POV is expressed above.  <br/><br/>What I want from this thread is to frame a discussion so that others can ask themselves similar questions, and tell us their conclusions, if they so desire. The first post isn't my final manifesto, it's an ice-breaker to start discussion.  What people say here may help me choose one conclusion from the non-compatible views I now hold.<br/><br/>I don't know whether I'll get any takers.

"Blackface used in the KnightsRealm LARP"? If that's the case, it looks like that website has a forum: I'd rather people approach them on their ground and ask what they think, rather than us decide how they must be/feel/think. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.knightrealms.com/index.php?option=com_smf&amp;Itemid=115" rel="nofollow">This appears to be the link to their forum.</a><br/><br/>Please, if you have something to say about race, gender, whatever in regards to these people, bring up the discussion <b>with those people</b>. I'm entirely uninterested in turning this forum into the silent judge and jury of Racism in Game-Paralleling Media.  If you want to carry a discussion off-site, though, like on a blog or something, I'd be happy to post a link here.<br/><br/>If this is a discussion about identity, identity politics, respect/recognition, and deciding who to follow or trust the opinions of because of their relation to the gaming community, that's another interesting topic (especially from my sociological background), but again that's something that I'm not interested in being discussed here*. That's more of a 'blog post' kind of thing.<br/><br/>EDIT: I just remembered this group, which would also be a <b>great </b>place to discuss issues of race/ethnicity in Larping and the like:<br/><a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/RoleplayersOfColor/" rel="nofollow">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/RoleplayersOfColor/</a><br/><br/>But if I'm missing the mark, and you had something you wanted to talk about not related to the above two things, please state it, and we can carry on the discussion.
