Awesom-o-fy threads:<br/><br/>looking to reboot or update an old game (1995)<br/><br/>to incorporate recent advances.<br/><br/><br/>The play advice above is great-- but I'm particularly interested in things that are NOT in<br/>the existing rules-- or which outtright contradict the existing rules--<br/><br/>rather than a re-iteration of things that are already in the rules, such as 'only speak in character'.<br/>Posts like that aren't unwelcome here, but I'm hoping for more of "What I would change is..."<br/><br/><span style="color: #00CCFF;"><br/>It might help if I describe the Puppetland game I ran Saturday:<br/>Shane, Ami, and Ara made-up puppets which were as good as any ever made:<br/><br/>Constable Fartface couldn't say no to a woman in distress, couldn't stop hitting with his nightstick once he'd started, and couldn't hide quitely-- because his mouth was always farting.<br/><br/>Wandoo was a shadow puppet who was ponderous and unassertive (nicely contrasting against the zippy nature of shadow puppets).   Shadow puppets are hurt by water, but Wandoo wasn't damaged by rain-- because he forgot to be.<br/><br/>Marci was a perky gum-chewing finger puppet with a dangerously short attention span.<br/>Like the old "Oh no, Mister Bill!", but-- in her case--   "Oh yesssssssssss!~   Yayyyyyyy!"<br/><br/><br/>Everybody spoke in character &amp; I spoke like the narration text in a kid's book:<br/><br/>The puppets woke to meet a gypsy tinkerer who had just come from Respite &amp; they began to follow his gypsywagon tracks back to Respite... but when the tracks were washed-away, they had to overcome their fear of Haunt/ because<br/>Haunt was circling the village, so they had to walk Toward him.<br/><br/>They got hungry and explored a gingerbread house, where they met Baby Sausages-- the string of sausages who had been Punch and Judy's baby.    The Constable nearly choked on the Baby Sausages.   Baby Sausages wanted to be turned back into a baby, so his parents would love each other again.<br/><br/>Nutcrackers arrived and heard farts &amp; kicked in the door.  The gingerbread house collapsed on everybody except Wandoo.    <br/><br/>Wandoo fought Haunt.  Rain melted the gingerbread house, so Fartface and Marci could be free.   They met Judy and took a Coal Car from the G.M. Railroad to Punch's castle, but crashed into an Elephant who had been sleeping on the tracks, and the Coal Car was killed.<br/><br/>Nobody could think what to do next, except maybe ride the Elephant along the G.M. Railroad tracks.<br/><br/>Then an unprecedented eclipse occured, blocking out the sun, and everybody found themselves in their beds 20 minutes before the hour was over.  </span><br/><br/><br/>So...   Puppetland worked fine, as long as I had enough Old School GM Ideas to generate more and more Plot  for the players to consume.<br/><br/>And-- as long as they could invent things from whole cloth-- yes, the puppets could move the story forward also.<br/><br/>But the only conflict the system has built-in is GM vs. Players, rather than a web of conflicted-interests/ which would self-generate conflict, even when the Puppetmaster runs out of steam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326084/#Comment_326084" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T07:05:37+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  7:05AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...just thought about something.

Perhaps a formal mechanic for privacy or a somatic blocking gesture from the GM would be nice to add to the rules.<br/><br/>Thankfully again, we had a few people with "plot-moving" Cans and CanNots, but that can be attributed to player cleverness rather than system.<br/>Maybe for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a> the book could provide a list of great suggestions.<br/><br/>The railroady bits?  Yes.  The only thing I can think to change about the game is to give the players a map maybe of the land?  Let them decide the approach to their goal and then spot create difficulty there?  Give them meddling NPCs and see if they follow their advice or go their own way?<br/><br/>Also, the rule-book doesn't explicitly state (I don't believe) any advice for Can Nots.  But I have found the best way to keep things dark is to make Can Nots "prohibited behavior" and to negate any Can Nots that are "immunity."  One is a restriction, and one is a super-power.  Can Nots should be (totally in my opinion) the choke point for action.  <br/><br/>"I know I must never ever destroy something beautiful, but if I don't break this mirror we shall never get in to that secret passage behind it... oh my oh my, what to do?"<br/><br/>is much better than<br/><br/>"Haha, you fool!  You have darted behind a wall to hide, but I cannot be blocked by any barrier!  I am upon you!"<br/>unless the use of that super-power flavored Can Not is also tied to a black box, there's really no impact, and no need to just use it all the time to negate and invalidate GM provided obstacles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326107/#Comment_326107" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T08:12:24+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  8:12AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: somelady</cite><br/>The funny thing is though, that when they were doing it (in the first bit it was about being distracted by writing in a journal) I assumed they were fussing at me for being slow, which I'm more used to (if I had read up before hand and known about the time limit I never would've signed up, but it was a great time)</blockquote>\nDon't discount yourself, you were fun to have at the table.
