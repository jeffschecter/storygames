As a player, as when you play a Magic User in D&amp;D and you kill all the party because you didn't read the description of a Fireball and didn't know the area of effect? As a character when your player is sick of you and kill you in the most terrible way?<br/><br/>Jeepform count? Or other kind of LARPS?

Characters do say that, and they are despondent, but they are wrong.<br/><br/>Edit: I think one reason that people tend to try to shy away from this is that in practice, a failed pixel-hunt at a chokepoint can in fact make the whole game really lost, not just feel lost, it IS lost, in some situations.

That is, it sounds like you're looking for moments when the player identifies so strongly with the character that the despondency of the alter is really felt by the ego, if you know what I mean. That sounds like how sociologist of play Roger Caillois defines "alienation": a pathology of mimicry.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I have seen players approach that point. "With Great Power" strikes me as carefully calibrated to provoke an emotional response from the player on behalf of the character. Of course, the possibility of failure exists for both player and character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209758/#Comment_209758" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-31T19:20:19+00:00" title="May 31, 2009  7:20PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games have a much greater capacity to be frustrating when compared to linear entertainment. Its difficult to satisfactorily reach such moments in a game because the frustration element will likely be much higher than the other elements, such as sympathy for the character. <br/><br/>I think people feel failure all the times in games, but it rarely syncs up with meaningful character failure in the same way as movies. I was once in an Exalted game where there was a conversation to the effect of:<br/><br/>"I do XYZ charm stuff. How many mooks do I kill with kung fu?"<br/><br/>"5!"<br/><br/>"Oh... 5?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. The last guy won his soak."<br/><br/>"Hmm.

The characters seemed to hit dead ends at every turn, while the activities they were trying to stop had drastically escalated, threatening to destroy the city. They figured that they had lost, were unable to figure out what to do. On top of that, there were fractures appearing within the group, as developing loyalties tore them in different directions. The sense of despondency was not created by true powerlessness, but by being unsure of what to do. It's a classic point in conspiracy stories and many thrillers, even mysteries. The despondency was broken by reminding them of a key piece of information, previously overlooked, that then allowed them to pursue a conclusion of their choosing.<br/><br/>So, my suggestion is that if you're going to make a group feel despondent, you've got to set it up ahead of time. The characters should be rewarded with bits of the solution as they work through, but hold back one piece that ties it all together. Then, stop giving them rewards for their work, or give the rewards subtly, so they don't realize they've discovered something. It's amazing how quickly they abandon previous successes and become really despondent (both players and characters) if you also bring pressure on them from other angles. The secret is to reveal the final bit as all the characters but one have given up. That final bit should not be able to bring about success on its own, it should combine with all the other bits collected earlier in the story to empower the characters to about the conclusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209768/#Comment_209768" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T00:52:09+00:00" title="June  1, 2009 12:52AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Interesting question.</p>\n<p>I wonder if either of these examples from free-form RP would match what you're looking for...</p>\n<p>Example 1: My character was Tiberius Damarisk, vigilante, one-time bounty hunter and cold-blooded asshole. He was rather misogynistic in that he felt that women were useless for anything but breeding, which he wasn't interested in. Over the course of the RP, he met a woman who broke the image he had of women, a strong, useful woman. He eventually entered into a relationship with her that bordered on unhealthy obsession, but eventually settled into something resembling normal courtship, despite his non-existent social skills. One night, he did something meant to be a jest that ended up scaring her badly, which drove him into a self-destructive rampage through the criminal elements of the city. When she confronted him about it later, he tried to leave, and in anger and frustration, she stabbed him, twice. At that point, given his unstable state, I realized he couldn't do anything other than go get himself killed, believing the one bright spot in his life had turned away from him. I, as a player, felt helpless to stop it, because acting on 'realistic' character motivations and creating dramatic situation were the paramount values of the community. So I killed him off, despite the fact that I didn't feel that I was finished with the character.</p>\n<p>Example 2: Same setting, different character, Adrien Locke, charismatic young officer. Recent events had him on edge, and when a smart-mouthed youth baited him, he found himself in a duel with this youth. Knives, first blood. Little did he know that the youth was actually an assassin, sent to kill him. <em>I</em> knew, and had planned with the assassin's player to make it seem like he had. They fought, and when Adrien struck the winning blow and dropped his guard, thinking the fight done, the assassin struck, stabbing him in the clavicle. Adrien was more than a simple knight, he was an adept of healing magic, but he appeared to die there that night. Two of my female friends who played characters relating to his (his wife and his best friend) were struck. They confessed to actual tears and anger that I'd allowed that to happen. The helplessness, hopelessness they felt was real, because they'd grown quite attached to my character, and there was nothing they could do to save him. They couldn't even avenge him, as the assassin slipped out in the confusion surrounding his apparent dying. To assuage their anger, I revealed to them (but not everyone else) that Adrien had used his training and magic to place himself in a deep stasis state near to death to allow himself time to heal and that he would rise three days hence (heh) during the vigil held for a fallen knight.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209769/#Comment_209769" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T01:07:37+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  1:07AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is very tricky. Characters on the brink of utter failure can be very satisfying in a story, but when you mix the <i>game</i> into it there's also a significant chance of <i>players</i> feling frustrated, depressed, and defeated. Those things are far more likely to kill the game than anything else.<br/><br/>If I was attempting this kind of thing then I think I'd try for "everything seems lost" in a situational way rather than a mechanical way. Maybe the Eternal City is in flames, barbarians are at the gates, and the PCs seriously question whether they have any chance at all to rescue the things they love... but they aren't out of hit points/spells/mechanical resources. The situation is bleak, but the player's avatars aren't on the brink of implied "failure conditions" - that might give the message that there's still a game left to play, rather than an incipient TPK or TCK (total campaign kill).<br/><br/>That's kinda how our Wraith campaign worked out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209770/#Comment_209770" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T01:25:24+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  1:25AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2009 1:28AM by GB_Steve.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being lost happens quite a lot in Cthulhu, especially convention games.<br/><br/>I played in a game run by John Tynes at Continuum some years ago. We were students looking for a hidden painting in a dead artist's studio out of the way on the Gulf Coast. We were being stalked and killed by something, something to do with a wooden effigy in the overgrown garden. My character managed to escape once but then he decided he couldn't take it any more and took an axe to the statue, it came alive and killed him. As I'd expected really because it was a desperate act of someone with nowhere to go.<br/><br/>And in the Dying of St Margaret's my PC felt crushing failure, that's why he killed himself.<br/><br/>Crushing failure has to be final. If there's a way out, it's not crushing, or perhaps it's some kind of Deus Ex Machina which can be unsatisfying. Other characters might find a way to rescue the character and this is OK. In Simon's high-level game of AD&amp;D, we've had a few scrapes where characters have died only be be brought back in extremis by someone else. These times are fondly remembered by those involved as moments of high drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209777/#Comment_209777" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T05:39:43+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  5:39AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2009 1:05PM by johnzo.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I've rarely seen this in roleplaying games.

The difficult with modern games seems to be that nobody is really up to taking the responsibility - the GM won't do it because he's responsible for everybody having fun, the common player can't do it because he doesn't have the power, and if the game is some sort of cooperative endeavour, then it's probably not designed with failure in mind.<br/><br/>Still, sometimes this sort of thing is doable. I'm a very mechanical GM myself, doing whatever the system of the game indicates no matter what, so I didn't hesitate to lead our recent session of <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> to the blackest pits of despair when the system and the consequences of character choices indicated that. I could have softballed it when the cast down general of Maldor started giving lip to his cell-mates, but as the other players and the dice indicated dire consequences, he ended up dying alone and forgotten, a wretched and meaningless death. I had no pressure on myself to do anything to save the character, as I've always made it clear that I'm there just to facilitate choices and provide consequences; I'm not responsible for elevating characters, they become heroes of their own accord if they do it at all.<br/><br/>I find that an objective rules-system that gives a fair opportunity for both failure and success makes moments of despair pretty easy. TSoY is remarkably up-beat in general, but at heart it's an objective system that just happens to give pretty good odds to everybody - so it's possible to end up with utter failure and despair in the game if you play it with those sensibilities in mind. Traditional D&amp;D is similar in that it also celebrates despair and failure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209803/#Comment_209803" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T08:48:10+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  8:48AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Now that Eero is weighing in, it makes me wonder..

(Rather like DoSM, actually.) I've also played games where everything went very badly without being planned ahead of time. For me they were two slightly different experiences. <br/><br/>Like, in one of the CoC games we ended up eating each other -- but we'd more or less known we were going to a bad place when the GM pitched a CoC game based on the Donner party. So there was a slowly tightening nose of failure and hopelessness, and we watched the PCs slowly destroy themselves and everyone around them. Pretty horrific, but we'd known going in it was going to be like that, and so there was more a sense of exploring the failure than really feeling or experiencing the failure. <br/><br/>OTOH, I've had a few Unknown Armies games where the bad guys won, the good guys fucked up, lost and were tortured to death, broken as human beings, or other rather unpleasant things where we didn't know that was going to happen ahead of time. In those cases the sense of failure and doom had a different tone, one where the failure seems much closer to the player, who isn't shielded by the "well we knew this would happen" emotional buffer. As a result the games had much more of an experience the failure feel. <br/><br/>The funny thing is this even happened in one UA game where one of the players managed to "win." It was an end of the world scenario (from One Shots) where the PCs are alone in a desert town and have to escape murdering things. Most of the PCs got got, but one managed to survive to the end of the scenario -- only to find out the Apocalypse had come and gone and just forgotten about them, and thus he was now alone on earth, wandering from gas station to gas station until he ran out. In this game that was pretty much the best you could do, and the player was utterly depressed by it. (Those whose characters died were much more upbeat. After all, they were just dead.)<br/><br/>Crossposted with J: and I think his points are solid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209838/#Comment_209838" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T10:49:41+00:00" title="June  1, 2009 10:49AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I have understood you correctly, you are searching for:<br/><br/>1) a game where the helplessness is REAL, it's not a temporary situation during a story-arc.<br/>2) the Helplessness is not mandated: it CAN happen, but it must be a risk, not a certainty<br/><br/>Right?

thoughts.<br/><br/>First, I think the subject of the hopelessness is important. IMO, it can't *just* be the characters' lives, it needs to be the characters' <i>goals</i> or <i>interests</i>. That often means the characters must be at risk of losing something external to themselves, but it can also include more dramatic elements like personal redemption/integrity/etc.<br/><br/>Also, I agree with Brand that there are different kinds of "hopelessness", and they each <i>feel</i> different for players. But I would actually say there are 3 kinds, not just 2:<br/><br/>- First, there are times when the players purposely enter into "desperate" situations for dramatic reasons. Let's call this "dramatic desperation". I think "dramatic desperation" is the most common type of "hopelessness" that players experience (IME). While this type of "desperation" can certainly be satisfying, since the players basically chose that route of play, like Brand said it usually (IME) has a certain emotional safety that keeps it from feeling truly hopeless or desperate for the player.<br/><br/>- Second, there are times when the players simply have bad luck with the dice or whatever, and they find themselves in a situation where they can't get out of. Let's call that "mechanical desperation". While that type of situation can be a lot of fun if the players are open to it, I think it also holds a lot of potential for player frustration, since it can sometimes feel like the player is losing their ability to effectively play the game.<br/><br/>- And lastly, there are times when mechanical circumstances and dramatic elements come together and find a particular synergy. Let's call that "emergent desperation". The few times I have experienced "emergent desperation" have been some of the most memorable and visceral gaming experiences I've ever had.<br/><br/>This type of "hopelessness" might emerge out of mechanical failure, but more interesting are those times when the players' tools just end up working against their goals or interests. The reason I think this sort of situation facilitates such visceral responses is because the player still holds all of their mechanical power---it's just that all their power can't help them.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8982&amp;page=1#Item_12" rel="nofollow">An example I mentioned before</a> was a game of Lacuna where I was playing a min-maxed badass. But what happened? My character fell in love with a woman who only existed in the dream world. In many ways I was playing the most powerful character in the game, but all my skills were about violence, which ran counter to my goal of love. The more I tried, the farther and farther away from me my goal seemed...<br/><br/>"Emergent desperation" is the kind I would like to experience more of, but it's difficult because by definition it's something you can't plan for, it's something that has to "just happen". I'm sure there are techniques that players can use to set themselves up for "emergent desperation", but I can't necessarily say what those techniques are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210266/#Comment_210266" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T20:59:54+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  8:59PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Mortality is a threat in most games.

People seem to be mostly entertained and shocked by it, rather than demoralized as players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
