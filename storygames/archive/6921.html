In this sense using technobabble becomes a proces in which the player attempts to defeat the NPC-machine/phenomenon. One might even do a TTBB with Polaris: \u201cBut only if the Flux Radiator overheats\u201d \u201cAnd futhermore the Radiator is bombarded with Tachyon particles causing it to stop the timetravelling aliens\u201d etc.<br/><br/>Just a chaos of thoughts from here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154275/#Comment_154275" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T19:11:17+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  7:11PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2008 7:34PM by Arpie.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, that's the best idea so far, Morten. <br/>\n<br/>\nI particularly like the other side of the argument, the idea of the conundrum or machine "fighting back" with phrases like "critical transfer conduit failure" or "unable to shut down, shifting to explosive overclocking mode."<br/>\n<br/>\nThat, combined with the rule of three idea from above gives me a lot of food for thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: And I forgot to recap Robert and Graham's ideas for bonuses to original technobabble, repeat use and sundry other elements you'd like to encourage.<br/>\nThanks.
