We've been playing different games with mixed success--a really good game of Dogs in the Vineyard, a not-so-hot Cortex Fantasy scenario, a DOA-but-still-played-four-sessions Burning Wheel sandbox game.  I suggested Shock, and took the main facilitation role, and I'd like your comments on what I could have done differently/better.  I've played Shock before, and one of the guys in the group had read the book.  The other two players were a husband and wife team that have played a lot of Pathfinder, Shadowrun, and CoC.  We used some of the Human Contact refinements, but were not playing a game set in Academy space.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a few symptoms I noticed that I'd like your help in diagnosing.  I might think of more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe took forever--setting/protagonist creation took over an hour, and by four hours in, we'd only completed one round of scenes.<br/>\nWe played mostly in summary mode--in stake setting, we'd talk though a lot of implications, and once the dice were rolled, it was basically "yup, option A."<br/>\nWe didn't understand the role of Features--are they "just" flags, and only the number is mechanically important?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's an AP recap.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough setting creation went long, it looked good.  Our Shock was consciousness transfer, and our issues were Military Service, Discrimination, Mind/Body Dualism (or lack thereof), and Religion.  Praxes were Social Activism vs. Terrorism and Reason vs. Coercion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Military Service protag was a guy who had reupped for another fifteen years in a combat body (think Old Man's War, but with a used body instead of an engineered one--his was a convicted gangbanger), but was now regretting his decision on moral grounds.  His Terminus was to die, permanently.  His antag was his CO, who wanted him alive for his valuable experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Discrimination protag was a researcher who was about to make a breakthrough in AIs but was dying from cancer and (Terminus) wanted to get transferred to a fresh body.  His antag was his department head who wanted him to die in order to take his credit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mind v Body protag was a retired platoon leader and patriot who had received his reward--the body of an enemy POW with a mysterious dragon tattoo.  His Terminus was to realize he was actually a third entity, a combination of new body and old mind.  His antag was the wife of his body, who was a true believer in the enemy's cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Religion protag was an activist who had lost her husband in a car wreck because the Roman Catholic church, of which they were devout members, had made the transfer process anathema.  Her Terminus was to change the church's policy.  Her antag was a corrupt archbishop who had used the transfer process to his own benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter an hour or hour and a half of setting this all up, we were ready to start play.  People were already starting to get a little fatigued, and I wasn't sure how to get them fired up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMilitary Service Scene 1 was him in his new body, pushing paper back home.  He went to his current CO and asked to get put back in his old body and removed from his contractual obligation.  Stakes were: Does he get into his old body? and Does he get deployed to a combat zone?  Answers were no, yes.  The CO decided he didn't want unsure whiners in his unit, and pushed to get him transferred.  This feels like it should have been a dramatic scene, or could have been, anyway, but it played out just about as simply as this paragraph--no punch.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscrimination Scene 1 was him asking the department head to allow the use of grant money to pay for a transfer.  The department head agreed to ask the board.  Stakes: Does the board authorize the expenditure? and Does the department head get inveigled in the research project?  Answers were yes and yes.  We weren't quite sure when to roll the dice on this one--the conflict was clear, but we didn't roleplay out much of the board hearing and never gave the board members names or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nMind v Body Scene 1 was a long one, with a bunch of escalations.  The skeleton of the scene was really neat, but I didn't feel like we got any meat onto it (this was my protag).  He was hanging out in a bar in the combat zone, working as a logistics contractor.  Since he was wearing an enemy's body, the leader of an insurgent cell propositioned him to join.  He sees through it, and out of patriotic duty, agrees to join so as to collect valuable intel.  The stakes: does he collect strategic intel? and does he have to kill an American to gain the cell's trust?  He bombed on getting the intel pretty quick, but I sacrificed his link to patriotism to reroll the killing and it ended up escalating to "...and gets caught."  I failed again, but sacrificed my link to my combat buddy, the Military Service protag.  It ended up escalating again to "...and it's your buddy who catches you."  On the last reroll, I succeeded, but we narrated that he planted a bomb in a cafe, saw his buddy on the way out, and saved his buddy from going in.  The bomb goes off, but no one dies, and he confesses to the buddy and gets picked up as an informant/mole for the buddy's new special forces squad.  I voluntarily (right?) changed both Links: from "my combat buddy" to "my handler" and from "I am a patriot" to "...but my hands are bloody."  The negotiation/narration was about this dry again.  I could feel the drama, but we weren't bringing it to the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nReligion Scene 1 was the biggest dud.  The activist was leading a rally, and an emissary of the archbishop approached her after only 250 people showed up (she was expecting over 1000).  She meets with the archbishop, and we have some serious issues finding intents for both of them.  He wants her to stop--she wants him to give her public support.  Eventually, we decide on Does he coerce/bribe her into shutting up?  and Does she find evidence to blackmail him later?  Finding the evidence escalates to "...and you have hard, publicity-worthy proof."  This sounds pretty good when I write it down, but it was the two people who had never played, and there was some serious foot dragging over the stakes, and the explanation for the roll outcomes was pretty half-heartedly delivered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then we stopped, because one round of scenes had taken us four hours, and we all had other obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre these growing pains?  If/when we continue, will we grow past them?  How could I better have facilitated?  What things should I have highlighted?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks much!<br/>\n<br/>\nP.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Lay out your Grid, get one or two Minuti\xe6 written down for the Shock and each issue, and <em>go</em>! Don't forget: you're not building a whole world. You're building a situation for a short story. If you like the world \u2014 the one that's gained all of its details <em>in play</em> \u2014 at the end, keep the stuff you've created and build onto it for next time.</p>\n<p>What's going on is that you have this high-altitude view of the world, where all the detail is from that height. It's like orbiting the world in the Space Station, then trying to guess what's happening in each of the houses at dinner as you're passing over at 18,000 mph.</p>\n<p>I know, that part's fun, but that's a serious rule. Write the Issues and the Shock, as the Shock: owner to tell us two things about the world that are relevant, then have each Issue owner say what that means in two Minuti\xe6. All those brilliant ideas will then be relevant to the situation at hand, rather than being an implacable wall of fact.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parker%20D%20Hicks" title="Parker D Hicks"><img alt="Parker D Hicks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parker%20D%20Hicks">Parker D Hicks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317307/#Comment_317307" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-20T17:59:13+00:00" title="March 20, 2011  5:59PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua;<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, that might do it.  Heck, I think it took us fifteen minutes to decide on a Shock.  When you facilitate, do you come in with a Shock ready prepped?  Do you jump on the first one someone recommends?  We spent a little time debating the merits of different Shocks and Issues because we were worried about selecting a dud.  Do you trust the group to work out something awesome with less prep than that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback--I really like the idea of Shock, but I think maybe I should play in a game with some experienced players before I try to facilitate again.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I play all the time at cons, so I leave it up to the other players \u2014 I'll just give my favorite ones every time and I want to know what they're into. If they get really stumped, I throw one out there, which they immediately reject, and they throw out a better idea.</p>\n<p>Remember the Yes/Unless No/Unless Yes rule: If someone throws an idea on the table and someone says "eh" to it, move on to a new one <em>until someone says yes</em>.</p>\n<p>There are rules built into the game to help you play your first time, but a lot of them are built into the rest of Human Contact. The chapter structure is designed to ease you into the game piece by piece so you don't need to know everything at once. By skipping the rest of the book, you're sorta taking the engine out of a car and having a hard time getting it to get you to the supermarket.
