Ouchie, ouchie. He's right, of course. We're stuck in a rut, and all the indie innovation and experimentation in the world isn't going to help unless people start thinking big and get their stuff out there. Which means taking huge economical risks. Perhaps the accepted indie truth "don't spend money printing your game, start small!" is counter-productive? Perhaps it should be "start large"?</blockquote>\nJonathan replied:\n<blockquote>Bankrupting ourselves for the good of the hobby, Matthijs? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Honestly, it seems like it would be better to create structures that allow us to be increasingly influential, as we have with the steadily increasing indie presence at GenCon and various conventions.</blockquote>\n...and I replied:\n<blockquote>Well, yes and no - "yes" if you want to influence a few hundred people; "no" if you want millions of people to play more and better role-playing games. That's what I mean by thinking big, that sort of megalomania. Getting funding from corporations. Getting games into schools. Etc.</blockquote>\nAnd now it seems (from posts and whispers) that people would like to say more on the subject. So.

I remember, as James Wallis does fondly, the time when Virgin stores had huge roleplaying sections and compare that with the three 4E books that are now stocked by borders.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that the big shop presence that we've lost didn't really have anything to do with RPGs, though. Virgin stocked piles of RPGs because they wanted something to go beside their CCGs. The high profile period was driven by Magic (and VTES and Battletech, and Netrunner) not any RPG. So it's not really that we have failed in our marketing since then, rather that the wave we were riding has subsided. Sadly what we have largely failed to do is hang onto the coat-tails of computer RPGs in the same way, and get things like the Warcraft RPG into computer game stores.<br/><br/>Could we do it in our own right? Could we deliver any style of tabletop RPG to the masses in a way that gets it sold in high street stores regularly? I suspect the answer is simply no, we couldn't, because the truth is that this is a minority passtime, and most people will never ever go for it, no matter what we do. We an try, and we can push the boundaries (as 4E does by profile, and Ron is trying to do by getting Spione put into German bookshops), but we already know where the avenue of success lies ... turn our games into computer games and they *do* sell just like that.<br/><br/>I think maybe what James doesn't say is that the RPG hobby has already made the leap to mass market appeal. From D&amp;D and Fighting Fantasy we have grown an industry of computer games that dominates the entertainment industry now. Fantasy RP is now a normal thing, spin off movies from computer RPGs dominate the film schedule every year (along with fantasy children's movies that also would likely never have been made without the RPG industry). We've done it. We've won, we just found out that pen and paper and tabletops weren't the best format to do it in (and even there you *do* see Murder Mystery games, which are a form of RP poem, in most high streets).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS" title="timeLESS"><img alt="timeLESS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i253.photobucket.com/albums/hh79/gamestribe/cthulhumobster.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS">timeLESS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178268/#Comment_178268" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T04:00:42+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  4:00AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2008 4:05AM by timeLESS.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, uhmm is this about  conflating success with sales ?

The last part though i just really don't buy. In order to appeal to this mythic "mass" of consumers i must first design something that is different from what i'm currently enjoying, otherwise what im currently enjoying in story-games would already be a mass-market hit no? Then after I have done this, and have designed something that DOES in fact appeal to a mass-market then they in return will design games/things that are derived from a thing i merely created for them (ie NOT for myself). Also i im not convinced at all that mass awareness of a niche leads to diverse and creative products.

To reach the mass market, you need <i>mass marketing</i>. If Coca-Cola marketed their drinks like indie gamers market their games, they'd have an obscure webpage with a paypal button somewhere that you could find by trawling web fora discussing soft drinks. If role-playing game manufacturers had the same sort of marketing budgets &amp; savvy, they could become a mass-market hit.<br/><br/>Then this:\n<blockquote>Then after I have done this, and have designed something that DOES in fact appeal to a mass-market then they in return will design games/things that are derived from a thing i merely created for them (ie NOT for myself).</blockquote>\nIndie games, freeform games, jeepform games, role-playing poems... they're made by people who played traditional games. Most of us probably started with D&amp;D, and some of us still play it. So I think mass-market designs can definitely inspire innovative designers.<br/><br/>And finally:\n<blockquote>Also i im not convinced at all that mass awareness of a niche leads to diverse and creative products. Id sooner argue for the opposite to happen, mass awareness might lead to standardization and centralized creative processes that are mostly known for copy-paste design.</blockquote>\nThat's not easy to agree or disagree completely with. To reach a mass market in the first place, you usually need to innovate at some point. D&amp;D was an innovator. So was Coke. In computer games design, which definitely has mass awareness, there is a huge creative indie community - indie designers are coming up with amazing new stuff all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178273/#Comment_178273" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T04:49:41+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  4:49AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking what this thread needs, instead of my opinions, is some insight from people who have studied business, corporation history, that sort of thing.

I do not at all disagree that you need mass-marketing to reach mass-market ( though perhaps you need a mass-market to reach mass-marketing all the same)<br/>Instead, we both set out different directions even from before the start of the discussion (designing wanting to reach mass-market vs. designing for fun and for self.)  and that could indeed shift the topic entirely towards that single issue.   Therefore i will just post these last few more general remarks and leave it at that.<br/><br/>My gut feeling is that gamedesigns are subject to diminishing returns. In more then one way, but I'll try and keep on topic. Indie games design creates games that by their very specific nature don't allow for big target audiences. Generally its designs havent been based on the needs of a large target audience but instead on either the very specific needs of the designer and his community or in relative isolation. To reach that "massive" target audience you'd need to base your designs on its perceived wants and needs. These target audiences are like bubbles in a ...well ... bubbly landscape and they intersect and overlap. I think I could design a game for a target "bubble" (an audience with the same wants and needs im aiming to fulfill) and THEN try and reach all the people in that specific bubble. But as soon as I try to reach other bubbles i have to make concessions and this is were the "diminishing returns" kicks in. I could put in alot of effort to make my game accessible to all these different bubbles of wants and needs, but the energy invested in its design beyond its target bubble will yield less and less appeal in return. Of course one could design a game targeting the huge bubble of "male power-gamers" and hey thats cool! but i think you need to be VERY aware of your target audience, its bubble and designing beyond the wants and needs of that specific group. <br/><br/>Hell I wish I could say that in a much clearer way, i hope you get what im trying to say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178299/#Comment_178299" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T07:29:30+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  7:29AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>If role-playing game manufacturers had the same sort of marketing budgets &amp; savvy, they could become a mass-market hit.</i><br/><br/>This is so bizarre I don't know if I can make heads or tails of it.<br/><br/>Are you just of the opinion that "good marketing can sell anything?"<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178310/#Comment_178310" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T08:22:53+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  8:22AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs,<br/>\n  If we look at other niche markets (that is, ones similar to RPG games), we see a similar issues. Take Comic books and Movies (as opposed to tabletop rpgs and computer rpgs). The Comic book industry is struggling to turn a profit and despite their efforts have never really reached a mainstream audience. Sure, more and more people are aware of comics such as Batman or X-Men, but that awareness does not translate into people going out and buying comics. Yet, if you make a movie based on a comics franchise, it is a pretty good chance it will make its money back and has a more than average chance of being a block buster. Even so, this does not translate into a marked increase of comic books (I am sure there are spikes around the release/publicity of the movies, but no long term gains). There was a time when comic books were available in mainstream outlets (drug stores, even supermarkets), but this did not last. Even an attempt to target more mainstream audiences with titles such as Archie or what have you did not seem to reach past those titles themselves. Or even last past the lifespan of a fad.<br/>\n  I am not trying to say its impossible or that its not worth trying, but I am trying to say that it might be wise to set the correct expectations and make business decisions based on that expectation.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178313/#Comment_178313" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T08:34:17+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  8:34AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Raises hand:<br/><br/>Are we talking about getting the masses to <i>Play-Pretend together in some sort of group activity</i>, or are we trying to get them to play <i>role-playing games</i> and <i>story games</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178320/#Comment_178320" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T08:56:58+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  8:56AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, yes, I agree about having to keep in mind your target audience.<br/><br/>Ben, you need to read the comment in context - it's more like "even if you have a good product, you'll still need mass marketing to sell it in huge quantities". It was an answer to an assumption (as I understood it) that if games are good enough, they'll automatically find their market. <br/><br/>Dave, what I'm saying is sort of a response to the "let's build our business slowly and carefully, starting as small as possible" trend of indie gaming. That business model works, but I believe that to get to a larger market you need a leap of faith - you need to take some huge risks that (as James Wallis says in the original presentation) sometimes crash and burn, because (Wallis again) the alternative for the hobby is a slow death. It's good that we make great games for each other - but if nobody starts recruiting 14-year-olds by the thousands, in thirty years the hobby will consist of the same people, only with gray hair and potbellies.<br/><br/>Robert, that's a good question. I think that to reach a large audience a designer/company/corporation must be willing to experiment and make things that don't necessarily fit the traditional role-playing form. To me, solo gamebooks are a good example: They're sort-of-roleplaying games, only much easier for most people to pick up and play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178326/#Comment_178326" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T09:30:53+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  9:30AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of thoughts:<br/><br/>In what ways do rpg or story-games differ from table top games (board, card, dice)?<br/>In physical presentation?<br/>In numbers needed for a good play experience?<br/>In time to play?<br/>In object of play?<br/>In assumed age range of players?<br/>In time to learn?<br/>In relationship between players at the table?<br/>In what is provided by the players, versus provided by the games rules/structure?<br/>In what sort of people that the game is meant to appeal to?<br/><br/>[You don't need to answer those out loud, btw.

He's got deals (in the works) with regular book stores are spy museum gift shops and stuff like that.  I don't really know the details and think he's kind of crazy but it's the closest thing "in action" to anything being talked about here.<br/><br/>All this talk is also similar to the stuff that was discussed in "The Infamous Five" essays on The Forge years back.  The general conclusion is that if you want to reach a mainstream audience you have to create games around mainstream topics.  I think we have those even in some of the weirder stuff we have.  I've explained Dogs in the Vineyard to total non-gamer strangers whose eyes light up and even occasionally say things like, "Wow, I'd like to try that." because they're hooked by the religious angle (unlike most gamers who are turned off by it.)<br/><br/>What we DON'T have is any idea or process to reach mainstream people.

Even if they suddenly were to nail something really viable with a bunch of potential to make a splash with a wider audience, it probably would mean, well, selling the item off to a bigger company to develop and distribute.<br/><br/>At that strikes me as running headlong into one of the great draws of producing something independantly: Owner/creator control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178400/#Comment_178400" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T15:16:17+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  3:16PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe the problem is not that the games are for a specific niche. The problem is many people who could possibly belong to that niche know nothing about them (or are mislead into believing they are something completelly different they are not).<br/><br/>See, I have the same "problem" with Heavy Metal music. "Common" people believe it is all about violence, demon workship and death. Oh, my... But they have hardly listened to more that two or three songs (without actually knowing about what they are really intending to say). So they say they don't like Havy Metal, and say they will never listen to it.<br/><br/>Then I talk to them, and explain that there are many different sub-genres, themes, moods, sounds... That there are happy, romantic, sweet, fun, deep, joyous, pious songs. That there is more than Death and Dark, violence and noise. There is Power, Symphonic, Gothic, Progressive, Speed, White...<br/><br/>More than once, people told me in the end "Wow! I never realized there was more to it than I first thought. I should listen to a few songs about that stuff you told me about."<br/><br/>My point is the problem is not that the games are not good enough. It has nothing to do with the "market sales anything" idea. The problem is people put labels on things. Most of the time those labels are trully damaging and scare away potential users/fans. What I understand about Matthijs' complains is that we should start trying to promote what people would like about the games, openly and friendly. As opposite to the "underground" style it currently exists. It is not a matter of forcing people like what you like, or even to instead design something different instead. It is more on the ground of letting people really know what this is all about, trying to make them forget those old useless labels, and not making it an inaccesible, hard to find and to understand thing only a few chosen or lucky ones will ever find.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178402/#Comment_178402" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T15:36:20+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  3:36PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2008 3:41PM by jenskot.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Partially cross posted with Knife Fight with edits and additions...<br/><br/>Hi Matthijs, I don't have a huge amount of time but...<br/><br/>Some great books to read:<br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference/dp/0316346624/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226499749&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Start-Time-Tested-Battle-Hardened-Starting/dp/1591840562/ref=pd_sim_b_41" rel="nofollow">The Art of the Start: The Time-Tested, Battle-Hardened Guide for Anyone Starting Anything</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996/ref=pd_bbs_11?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226499749&amp;sr=8-11" rel="nofollow">Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Word-Mouth-Marketing-Companies-Talking/dp/1419593331/ref=pd_sim_b_12" rel="nofollow">Word of Mouth Marketing: How Smart Companies Get People Talking</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Make-Millions-Your-Ideas-Entrepreneurs/dp/0452273161/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226502007&amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">How to Make Millions with Your Ideas: An Entrepreneur's Guide</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/E-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226502062&amp;sr=1-2" rel="nofollow">The E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It </a><br/><br/><a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/hbsp/case_studies.jsp?_requestid=17939" rel="nofollow">A little know fact is that you can buy AMAZING case studies on many of the mass market successes you mention through Harvard's Business School</a>.

But the information on clarifying what you are selling, why it has value, who you are selling to, why they should care is fairly universal. <br/><br/>Ultimately, to truly be a mass market success, not only does it take doing all of the above well, it takes many years or decades, persistence, and diversification. Many known successes didn't make it big trying to push 1 product or idea. They push forward many till one broke through. Don't get too invested in 1 idea. The best way to have a great idea is to have many ideas first. It also takes money but in most cases if your idea is great and tested on a small scale, you can find investors to fund you. <br/><br/>Many music companies won't sign beginning artists unless they have been able to sell at least 1,000 CDs or downloads on their own. And then will only put in limited marketing resources (online marketing, social networking, sponsorships, press, community building) if they expect to sell 10,000 CDs or stick to digital releases only. If they can expect to sell over 10,000 CDs, then they will put in a modest amount of money for advertising. My point is that it is a slow build. And rather than put everything into 1 idea, it's best to diversify and then focus in when the numbers reflect the growth needed for further investment. <br/><br/>Just look at Apple! They've been around for 30+ years and 10 years ago ago they had less than 4% adoption in the computer market (which is still huge). The climb towards the iPhone involved many steps and many products and many failures!<br/><br/>The iPod itself was a long term plan. They had a basic plan for an iPhone like device when the iPod first came out. They released versions of the iPod strategically to have each new version slowly teach you how to use what would eventually be the iPhone. And all their entertainment deals over the years is partly what helped them lock in the major labels to release iTunes which was a huge component of their strategy which also includes eventually turning their desktops and laptops into large version of the iPhone + entertainment center + TV. <br/><br/>We scream about playtesting all the time but another factor is market testing. Once you know your product works, you have to test a sample of your market and how they will react and talk about it. Which may involve making changes and will greatly inform on how to market your product. When I go to Gencon, most people can't tell my why I should buy their game. You also have to make the first step easy. Don't want to buy? How about a demo or take away or contact info. Bought the game? You still need to make sure they play it. Hell, if they play it at the con... awesome... more sales. But wait... why don't you have character sheets to give them? Or quick start rules? How are they supposed to play right away? But it's not just RPGs. Huge billion dollar companies make these mistakes or deprioritize these techniques. <br/><br/>It's also important to ask why reaching mass market appeal is important. For money? How much? At what cost? Awareness? Awareness by who? My fiance is a best selling author who has her books available in Borders and B&amp;N. Even at that level you would be amazed how many sales she compromises to keep her integrity and stick to her vision. She's passed on starring on TV shows where the cost to her vision was too high. And reaching a mass market is one thing, staying there... oh man, that's another :-) I think for story games designers and publishers, the question might be what are your goals? If they involve reaching a wider audience, then how do we double their existing audience let alone times it by 100! What's the next step? I don't think we've fully tapped smaller niche markets, or even the ones we are in. Trad gamers, people interested in improv, theater, teachers and students that use simulations in schools. <br/><br/>I hope that helps!<br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178406/#Comment_178406" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T15:41:53+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  3:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also think Hitura, tony dowler, and komradebob make great points about traditional RPGs striking gold with the mass market via video games (products often change when the hit Mass Market), about what kids are playing these days, and that Borders is not the starting point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178408/#Comment_178408" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T15:51:14+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  3:51PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, one thing RPGs/SGs have going for them is the fact that pretty much evryone is capable of the core activity of <i>Make-Believe with pals.</i><br/><br/>It might be valuable to look to that very simple, core, starting idea.<br/><br/>Frankly, that can be a little hard, especially for folks like us here who are long-term hobbyists and have long ago surpassed that very simple starting point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178409/#Comment_178409" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T15:53:43+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  3:53PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>This is interesting stuff.

At some level, this is getting back to a gamebook as tool-kit concept, but it might be possible to go even further in that direction.<br/><br/>Edit: There's also the possibility that, as far as sales go, we're trying to sell the wrong thing.

I've also said that Chris Engle might be better off selling cheap bagged toy soldiers/cowboys and indians/dinosaurs, and giving away "ashcan-y" versions of his minis Matrix Game variants at conventions.<br/><br/>I think there may be more possibility there than folks give credit to, both in terms of cash inflow and getting people to try out games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178418/#Comment_178418" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T16:42:03+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  4:42PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why hasn't WoW been mentioned?

I'm going to generalise here, but I am guessing that we make great games and then we find people to sell them to, rather than finding the games that people want to buy and then making the games to sell them? Thats certainly what I did with D&amp;H...; which sort of means I should hand by degree back!! &lt;g&gt; Actually, no it doesn't. It means I made something I was passionate about without thought to sales, market or future profitability because the model of production and distribution that we use allows me to do that and not financial cripple myself in the process. Thats the beauty of small-press anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if marketing is about facilitating exchange then we need to find out what sorts of games experiences non-gamers want and then provide them with those experiences. That requires market testing. It requires not being precious about the things that we do and more importantly how we do them. And that starts from a point of 'how do you like to spend your time with your friends and what sorts of games do you play?' not 'roleplaying, wanna do it?'<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone actually sat down with a group of their non-gaming friends and tried to run a focus group about attitudes to roleplaying and what interests or puts them off? Have we asked these non-gamers what sort of game they might entertain and then have we gone away and made that game? You know, like businesses do when they seek to innovate and develop their product?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not impossible, but it might be for our sort of gaming. Remember essentially we are a niche of a niche of a niche. We have won the war for mass market penetration. Trust me, we have. However 'we' are gamers-at-large, not storygamers. Look around you? Every city in the UK has a Games Workshop and it is as much part of the traditional highstreet package as HMV or M&amp;S.; That is the evolution of wargaming. 11 million people play World of Warcraft, a game which would not have existed without RPGs. It exists partly because it caught the zeitgeist at the right time (and lets not underestimate luck in all of this) and partly because it created a format where money-rich/time poor and time-rich/money-poor people could play together on an equal playing field. Whats the most successful book series of the last decade? Harry Potter - a concept that has driven children's fantasy to a new level of popularity. Look at the Pirates of the Caribeean, The Mummy, Batman, Spiderman etc series of films? They all speak to our gaming culture. Want to see where CCGs have impacted? Don't look to MtG, look to Pokemon and latterly Yugi-Oh. Multi-media successful properties based in gaming. Even board games and 'mind games' have a place in society now. And Fighting Fantasy books? My daughter has a series of Dr Who 'Choose your own adventure' books. She adores them. We have won. Games are mainstream.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust not OUR sort of games.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it may well be that we are the luddites. We are the ones stuck around our kitchen tables like we have been for years whilst the world moves on around us? It may be that fundamentally the act of roleplaying in the way we do it is so ingrained with negative stereotyping or barriers to entry that we simply cannot overcome them. However, we will not know unless we ask the question?<br/>\n<br/>\nLets make one thing clear though - if we, the small press community, wish to create change in that agenda then 'mass marketing' through traditional channels is not the way to do it. Fundamentally, it costs too much and the probable returns are minimal. For example, I looked into putting an ad for Duty &amp; Honour in a historical reinactment magazine. I know enough about these things to know that I would need at least three or four months worth to create a presence (one month is worthless, you might as well burn your money and hope someone sees the smoke!). It would have cost me around \xa3200 or in terms of sales ... probably around 40 sales. I don't think that is realistic, especially as the ads would be B&amp;W; Quarters in a ad-ghetto at the back of the mag.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, lets look at something else? Look at 'Tiny Adventures' on Facebook, the 4e mini-application. Genius. Its's shit - it has almost zero gameplay, no strategy and no real reward. However, it acted as a flag to literally tens of thousands of current and EX-roleplayers that something new was happening. How many of them went out and flicked through a copy of 4e? Who knows, but if some did then it did it's job. It identified and fired an exchange and signposted them to how they could fulfil that need.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut first, we have to ask the question. Know your market. Understand them and THEN create the products they want. Don't assume that there is just a massive well of roleplayers out there that haven't realised that they can and want to roleplay. That way lies folly and financial ruin.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178463/#Comment_178463" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T01:58:13+00:00" title="November 13, 2008  1:58AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2008 1:59AM by Matthijs.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neil, "we are the luddites" - very good. <br><br>The question I'm wrestling with right now is one that several people have asked: What, exactly, is this "role-playing" that I/we wish to bring to the masses?

RPGs require so much more work to set up that WOW, or Warhammer. It's not time (WOW players have plenty of time), its the preparation, and the organization, and the social side that's hard, and they are always hard. It's why lots of designers have tried to search for a way to make our sort of games have the ease of all the more popular types, by doing away with the need for preparation, or fixed GMs, or a consistent play group.<br><br>What's really ironic though, is that the more people do that, make changes to turn RPGs into something that works as well as WOW in attracting and holding people, the less like RPGs what they have produced become, and we start to have all those arguments about are they *really* RPGs (like I've seen people say about Spione). We even lose some of the people who have always played RPGs along the way, because they like preparation, and fixed GMs and consistent play groups, and long campaigns and all the rest of it.<br><br>Which goes to show you can't please all of the people all of the time <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178465/#Comment_178465" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T02:39:59+00:00" title="November 13, 2008  2:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have to change your product to the extent that it no longer represents your original product, then there was little or no market for your original product in the first place. However, if you change your product and use it as a gateway to other products, like your original product, then you might be onto a winner. Examples?<br/>\n<br/>\nApple and the iPhone and the rise in the 'cool' status of Macs?<br/>\nAny band who has 'sold out' and done a commercial album/single in order to expose themselves further - I'm sure we all have our favourites but I believe Kings of Leon are the current posterboys for this?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure there are others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing we are ludicrously poor at is producing proper entry level products. I remember at Games Expo we were asked by a father whether there was anything on our stall - and remember the Collective Endeavour stall has nearly 20 products on it all told - that was suitable for children? Uhmmm. Errrhhmmm. *furtive glances*. "Piledrivers and Powerbombs.....?" FAIL!<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this in mind, I actually echo the thoughts of a certain controversial games commentator from South America when he said that the Dr Who roleplaying game is the front line... It is. It is the current <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> property that I can see would make an excellent entry level product to the CONCEPT of gaming for young people. The only one I can think of that would be better is a Harry Potter one, but thats not going to happen. I fear, however, that the game will not be entry level - it will have to please us old grognards as well and thus it will fail on both counts.

It's been a while but we used to put up product websites where the product was stated as being in the testing stages but otherwise presented as if it was for sale. Then we spend a small budget on online marketing and advertising to see who goes where and what they click on. Then we make a few estimates based on expected conversion rates and the behavior recorded to decide if the product is worth doing or what needs to change to increase our conversion rates.

I wonder if you could click test games in this way. Build a mockup of an online game, say something akin to tinyadventures. Then see where people click to figure out what functionality and hooks are stickiest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item

        Hi Tony, I don't do this for a living but I partially work and manage many people who do as one of the many things my job requires (the list is very long!). <br/><br/>Very generally speaking we:<br/><br/>- decide how we will sell and distribute a product before producing anything<br/>- look at our existing brands, skills, interests<br/>- look at the types of products we ourselves buy related to the above<br/>- look for markets that also buy these type of products<br/>- research websites and magazines dedicated to these markets<br/>- see what products are advertised on these websites and magazines<br/>- brainstorm product ideas that we can offer<br/>- something whose main benefit can be described in a short sentence (my Gencon Seminar above has tips for this)<br/>- look at the competition, how can we differentiate our product? <br/>- choose something that stands out (a better, new, innovative, an unmet need, or highly in demands product)<br/>- make sure the potential profit margins allow for savings, growth, and mistakes<br/>- it can be manufactured quickly in small amounts at first and then at large amount with significant cost savings<br/>- use Google Adword keyword tools to see if people are searching for similar products, in what volume, how much those keywords cost and write down the results<br/>- keep testing the above, trying different keywords till you have enough traffic that a conversion rate of 0.5% (different people use different numbers) would cover all your costs<br/>- build a website advertising your product (which doesn't exist yet)<br/>- include a form that people who visit the website can sign up to for future updates<br/>- use Google Analytics to track who visits your website and how they use it<br/>- use Google Adwords to advertise the website (sometimes we initially use Myspace or Facebook targeted advertising)<br/>- analyze the results<br/>- optimize your advertising (wording, keywords)<br/>- analyze the results<br/>- optimize your website (wording, colors, fonts, layout, graphics, links)<br/>- analyze the results<br/>- if the response is poor, start the process again<br/>- if the response is good, run with it!<br/><br/>This is a gross simplification but it probably nails a few of the basic ideas. This is only one way to test a product. There are many more. There is a science to pricing alone! <br/><br/>Edit: We also usually restrict this to quick products with short life spans. With many of our artists, when we try to build them up as a brand, we often do things that would contradict much of the above in an effort to stay true to who the artist is and look for monetary success in the long term not the short term. But stick pretty close to this process for things like t-shirts and posters. Using my fiance as an example, she will often turn down short term monetary success for a slow build towards a lifelong brand sticking to her visions, integrity, and beliefs. Money is far from the only form of success. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178594/#Comment_178594" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T14:51:04+00:00" title="November 13, 2008  2:51PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2008 2:57PM by Alex F.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clearly some in the indie gaming scene lean toward prioritising the personal artistic vision as the basis for creating a game. The hope here is to express something you find meaningful (note: fun is meaningful) on your own terms, and to impact those others that share or are open to that perspective.<br/><br/>On this thread, some people have expressed a desire to approach things the other way, using a mass-market led approach to game creation. The hope here is to penetrate the consciousness of (some parts of) society and potentially transform how people play together.<br/><br/>(I guess the hopes could respectively be 'to revel in niche artistedom' and 'to make a killing', too. That's fine.)<br/><br/>I can't help but see an excluded middle, and perhaps one that even bridges directly between the two seemingly binary options. We talk about doing it, but I'm not sure we do it enough or go far enough:<br/><br/>Design for the people you know.<br/><br/>Yes, yes, I know you already design to quicken the pulses of your online crew, or with your game group in mind, and even in rare cases for your non-gaming friend who would totally play if there was only a game in that genre.<br/><br/>Nice! Not enough.* I'm talking about subordinating your design impulses to the task of delivering games that work with the people you know - not necessarily your grandpa and your anarchist pomo pal and your boss all at the same time, but a game that suits the desires and definitions of fun of your hockey crew . Another game that you could definitely sit down with at the family table on boxing day.<br/><br/>How to do this? Seriously explore their wants from fun. Get you sister to describe an imaginary game she would definitely play: would it be more like monopoly or hide and seek? Would it combine the two? What about winning? Is it important to get better as you play? Would it be revealing? And as one small piece of the questioning:  if the game was supposedly  'about' something, what would it be (monopoly is about being a property person)?<br/><br/>By gathering this data, you begin to draw a map of fun in your social environment. This is a map that points to buried treasure.<br/><br/>As an aside: John's posts have been awesome. Really, all I'm doing is standing on his shoulders and waving to one side: I think we could  invest a fraction of the effort he mentioned (for gathering market data) into synching what you do with the people dear to you.<br/><br/>I think this could be a worthwhile approach for some people, and for the health of the hobby, for the following reasons.<br/><br/>By designing for ourselves and other gamers, known, unknown, or imagined, I think we substantially curtail what we could be doing with the medium.<br/><br/>By designing outwards rather than inwards, but doing so with a  modest target audience in mind, that of people you know, I believe that you are likely to produce something authentic that will be played.<br/><br/>I ultimately believe that something authentic and distinctive, and at the same time directed towards other rather than towards the needs of the gaming community, is most likely to gain traction beyond that community. <br/><br/>I also believe that writing games to bind you to other people can only be a good and beautiful thing. <br/><br/><br/>With a flourish I shall now volte-face and submit that there may already be examples of this going on, and if you are one such it would be interesting to hear from you.<br/><br/><br/>*in case it needs saying, it may be enough for you. It's simply not the limit of where this approach can be fruitfully taken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178601/#Comment_178601" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T15:12:00+00:00" title="November 13, 2008  3:12PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my part I only design games that I hope will be fun to play with my friends. I figure, if I can't rope them into playing, what chance do I have with random strangers on the internet? On the other hand, it hadn't really occurred to me to see what I could make for other people I know. My brother-in-law is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nekoewen/2369213211/" rel="nofollow">very much into card and board games</a>, but not RPGs for some reason. My mom is a sci-fi fanatic who loves fanfiction. I have a friend who is big into computer games and anime, but doesn't like the play-acting aspect of RPGs. Following the tastes of any one of them could lead somewhere interesting.<br/><br/>I understand the idea that to really concentrate on commercial success, games would likely need to be designed with some kind of marketing/sales strategy in mind, but I just can't think on that level. I have no formal training in marketing type stuff (not that I have any in game design either), so it's just too big for me to really fit into my brain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178611/#Comment_178611" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T16:57:10+00:00" title="November 13, 2008  4:57PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2008 5:07PM by Burr.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are storygame texts that remind people that banter supports play, so don't be afraid to shout whatever.  That is so backwards from mainstream perspective.  When my folks get together to play cards or dominoes or even basketball, the game dies quickly if <i>it</i> fails to support banter and conversation.  We might use the game lingo, but we aren't really talking as <i>part</i> of the game or <i>about</i> the game, but about each other.  And when I go into that mode of thinking, I can't help but wonder, <i>Why</i> play a game that has the purpose of producing conversation about <i>itself</i>?<br/><br/>Storygames are about sharing stories, and non-gamers will understand that one shouldn't carry on an unrelated conversation when someone is telling a story.  That is true enough.  Think about when adults tell stories to each other in mainstream contexts.  People listen politely and respond appropriately, and then maybe someone else takes a turn telling a story -- it is a ritual, maybe even a game -- but nobody ever says, "Wouldn't it be better if your character did this instead?"  In part because we are afraid to interrupt, but far more because the story itself isn't the <i>point</i>.  The story, and the entire ritual, is just supporting a broader conversation.<br/><br/>We could take a step closer to storygames by thinking about those moments when a parent and child <i>share</i> a story.  A child almost certainly will make suggestions, or at least ask suggestive questions.  But the child often also identifies the protagonist with someone real.  The story becomes a conversation about that person.  The story continues in this new, shared context, but it supports the conversation, rather than the conversation supporting the story.<br/><br/>A slightly older child may make the conversation about people in general rather than people in particular.  Great, that's theme or something!  We must be really close to storygames now.  Maybe.  The thing is, for all that people talk about using narr games to explore premise; in practice, I get the feeling that storygamers here more often use premise to create better stories, which is a bit different.  I'm on iffier ground here, since it's still easier for me to put head in a mainstream hat than in storygames hat.  But my gut is to see the parent &amp; child as in something closer to a conversation-supporting mode than a story-supporting mode, while storygamers are more about using vocal interaction to support the story.<br/><br/>All in all, I think a huge obstacle between storygames and mass appeal is that it's not just about convincing people that sharing stories is fun.  The hard part is convincing them that sharing stories is worthwhile for it's own sake, to the exclusion of other things they could be doing, like playing a game that supports conversation and banter for their own sake.  I'm not sure marketing can do much to get past that obstacle, unless we are talking about marketing an entirely different product, which may or may not change the broader culture to be more accepting of storygames down the line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178791/#Comment_178791" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T10:41:45+00:00" title="November 15, 2008 10:41AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Honestly, I think part of the problem is that a lot of folks measure success in<i>sales</i>rather than<i>play</i>.

I'm hoping to eventually change that a bit, but that definitely seems to be the case right now.  I shifted to publishing games for free not because it would get my own games more attention, but because -- for a variety of reasons -- I wanted to be a part of a design and play environment in which creative content was freely shared and decided to try to be the change.  <br/><br/>And when a massive number of great games are available for free, as opposed to just some, that's when things will start to get interesting, when the balance begins to shift. What happens? People stop assuming that they need to pay money for good game content. Hopefully, everyone starts becoming a media producer (or remixer) instead of just a consumer.  Plus, if games are free, it doesn't really make any sense to measure success in "sales," does it (downloads and the like)?  All there is the quality of your own experience and those of people who also play the game.  It's not a race.  It's not a competition.  It's something else.<br/><br/>I don't think that should be what ALL of roleplaying becomes like, but that's a design and play environment that I'd be much more excited about, as opposed to many aspects of the environments that exist now.  So I'm selfishly working towards it for my own sake, but I also think it would be a healthier environment for certain forms of design and play that are ill-served by the current commercial environment (basically, any minority or specialized interest that doesn't have the numbers to sustain the attention and sales needed to appear "successful").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178809/#Comment_178809" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T13:21:30+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  1:21PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan: Actually, more directed at Balbanus: "playing" vs. "buying" isn't a trade-off, as one leads quite naturally to the other.<br/><br/>It really depends on what your goals are. If your goals are "this product must be free no matter what!" then, clearly, giving it away for free is a great way to meet those goals. Additionally, if your goal is "toss off a game with zero hassle" it works well also (for instance, my response to not having copies of XXXXtreme STREET luge for sale is "go download it and make your own!." Low hassle.)<br/><br/>But if your goals are in terms of play, and particularly in terms of communicating your ideas with your audience, I've yet to see a way in which "free for download" or "sales at cost on Lulu," used exclusively, actually work. (A free download combined with a book for sale? All evidence points to that actually working.)<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178810/#Comment_178810" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T13:55:18+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  1:55PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2008 1:56PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>I'm not sure that "for free! for free!' actually makes people want to buy your game more.

I have a lot of free games that I have never been "sold on".<br/><br/>Being free <i>lowers a barrier</i>; marketing a game <i>provides momentum</i>.<br/><br/>Getting a game into play takes more momentum than spending money does.<br/><br/>At least, that's how I see the dynamic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178814/#Comment_178814" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T15:03:46+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  3:03PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see the dynamic as being about how one chooses what game to spend your time investigating. PDFs + POD + Internet has raised the number of potential games beyond measure. You can no longer see all the games on offer by browsing an FLGS shelf, or even by browsing the web, no matter how much time you spend on it. We are spoilt for choice to the extent that the time required to look up a game and see whether you like it has become a significant cost that we are reluctant to pay.<br/><br/>So we look for things that might help narrow the field. Word of mouth recommendations of course, and discussions, and designers we know, and prizes and so on, but also I think many people just discount the free stuff because they think that there is a better chance of getting quality out of a game someone had to pay to produce. i.e. charging money for a game is a potential barrier to crapper games (because if you put money in, or charge, you may work harder on the quality), so people think free = potentially more crap, and avoid it.<br/><br/>Of course this equation doesn't work that well, because producing a game for sale is now also easy and cheap, and may not be much of a barrier to crappness any more, but I think people will take anything that reduces the pool of games they have to consider.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178822/#Comment_178822" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T17:03:09+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  5:03PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2008 5:05PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>See, I guess I disagree with your definition of "good."

I'd suggest that many (outside of D&amp;D, possibly most) rpgs/rpg products that are bought are never played and that many of those are bought in the full knowledge that they won't be played.  A while posting on rpg.net will demonstrate what I mean, as indeed would participating in the old Pyramid playtest boards (a problem SJ Games has since fixed to their credit).<br/><br/>That said, I wasn't arguing that if we make games free then widespread play will follow, free games tend to be played less than games that are charged for even when quality is similar.  I have some theories as to why that might be so, but for now it's enough that it is so and therefore it's worth charging for games because the mere fact of charging in and of itself makes it more likely they will be played.<br/><br/>However, the thread seemed focussed to me on sales as an end goal, and they're not.  The end goal is play, the purpose of sales (beyond compensating the designer remarkably poorly for their time) is to get the game out there to be played.  I was seconding Jonathan that the goal is play, sales are a means not an end.  If we start to see sales as an end, we're focussing on one tool and that could lead to not noticing other tools that might also help increase play.<br/><br/>Hope that's a bit clearer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178893/#Comment_178893" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T09:02:29+00:00" title="November 16, 2008  9:02AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get your point that sales are not play, but that doesn't mean that they're opposed.
