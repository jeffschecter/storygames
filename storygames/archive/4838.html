But I hope it's gonna change and that it's only the first one.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast Saturday and Sunday, we played a short game of Eric Provost's Red Box Hack. You can find the game on his blog : http://redboxhack.blogspot.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nI was the GM. The players were my wife Marie and our friend J\xe9r\xf4me. We are french, we are around thirty and we are all long time roleplayers. J\xe9r\xf4me and I began when we were 11 or 12 with red box D&amp;D for me and the french version of "das Schwarze Auge" for J\xe9r\xf4me. Marie played Vampire, Nephilim and Bloodlust in highschool with her brother. The list of games we played is so long that it could be a post in it's own rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore recently (meaning the last four years) the games we played include : R\xeave de Dragon (translated in english as "R\xeave, the Dream Ouroboros"), Donjon, HeroQuest, Polaris, Shock, Burning Empires, Spirit of the Century, Beast Hunters. But we don't realy play often because of work, a two years old girl and the fact that most of our friends live far away from us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe short version of the account is : it was a great game. The material conditions were againt us but the players entered into the rules very easily, they made great characters in a snap and we had a lot of fun playing. Long version follows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI already said that the conditions were'nt perfect since we only created the characters very late saturday night, Marie was realy tired and I was the only one who had read the rules. Though the character creation was very easy to explain and the Classes and their talents gave an burst of interest and energy around the table. Marie, who was falling asleep when we started, was soon designing her character, pondering the different powers and weapons. J\xe9r\xf4me was hooked by his PC talents and came immediatly whith a cool story for him. We ended with two PCs in one hour and decided to play the game on sunday afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the characters :<br/>\n<br/>\nPLAYER : J\xe9r\xf4me<br/>\nCHARACTER NAME : Alexandre / Alexis (see below why the two names)<br/>\nCLASS : warrior<br/>\nLEVEL : 2<br/>\nLIMITATION : none<br/>\nATTRIBUTES :<br/>\nHotness : +0<br/>\nDaring : +5<br/>\nAlertness : +2<br/>\nEloquence : +0<br/>\nSize : +4<br/>\nFleetness : +1<br/>\n<br/>\nTALENTS :<br/>\nArmor of scars (warrior)<br/>\nHomonculus (Serpent)<br/>\n<br/>\nWEAPONS :<br/>\n2 Heavy weapons : an axe and a mace (damages : 2)<br/>\nARMORS :<br/>\nTwo sets of heavy armor (armor class : 14)<br/>\n<br/>\nSTORY : to explain the fact that he had the Serpent's talent of Homonculus (he can divide himself into two copies with half Hit Points each), J\xe9r\xf4me came up with the story of Alexandre and Alexis who were twin brothers cursed by an evil sorcerer and forced to share the same body. They later met a mysterious master who taught them the gruesome ritual that enables them to separate for brief periods. Note that the ritual involve the fact that one brother must consume the other periodicaly in order to survive. So they take turns... When the character is only one, he goes by the name of the one who ate his brother (but Louise, Marie's PC, call them both Alex because it's easier). This gave a welcome grim touch to the character and the game. Of course, they search a way to lift the curse and kill the sorcerer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPLAYER : Marie<br/>\nCHARACTER NAME : Louise<br/>\nCLASS : channeler<br/>\nLEVEL : 2<br/>\nLIMITATION : yes<br/>\nATTRIBUTES :<br/>\nHotness : +0<br/>\nDaring : +5<br/>\nAlertness : +3<br/>\nEloquence : +3<br/>\nSize : +0<br/>\nFleetness : +2<br/>\n<br/>\nTALENTS :<br/>\nEnchant (Channeler)<br/>\nPuppet Strings (Channeler)<br/>\n<br/>\nWEAPONS :<br/>\nLance (reach : +1 armor class)<br/>\nThrown daggers (ranged)<br/>\nARMOR :<br/>\nLight (Armor class : 10)<br/>\n<br/>\n(continued in next post)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F" title="Antoine_F"><img alt="Antoine_F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F">Antoine_F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108615/#Comment_108615" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-16T16:40:49+00:00" title="November 16, 2007  4:40PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Notes about the characters creation :<br/>\n1 - you already noticed that the characters started at level 2 which gives them two talents instead of just one. I offered them this possibility because we only play once a month at best and we wanted to have fun with the cool powers of the game. Of course, they seized the opportunity ! The talents are one of the coolest parts of the game. Almost every talent is great and the fact that they are not dependant of the level is IMHO the best thing on earth you can do with this sort of things. I remember how the world of darkness had those powers which were only cool at the high levels you could never reach since you were already dead bored with the game. In the RBH, starting characters have less talents than high level ones, but you can pick just the one you want. Of course two talents are still more fun than one :)<br/>\n<br/>\n2 - About the attributes : on his blog, Eric said that he wanted to change the attributes mentionned in the PDF. Wits, Charisma and Fleetness would go out and Hotness, Eloquence and Stubbornness in.<br/>\nBut I had a problem with Stubbornness as I could not realy picture how to use it. And I could'nt find an attribute for stealth and other thievy activities. So I kept fleetness giving it this kind of use. During the game I wondered if my choice was realy that good. We definitely need a better explained set of attributes. And  we shouldn't have to think too long during the game to find which one must be used in a given situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 - About the random attributes : J\xe9r\xf4me rolled his monster of a PC straight, on his first try. Marie rolled at least ten crappy PCs with attributes adding up to +1 or +2 before rolling a monster too... Perhaps there's something to fix here. Maybe something like a fixed set of attributes but randomly assigned like Chris Chinn's D&amp;D game hack on his blog (http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2007/11/02/deep-dd-gamehacking-pt-1/).<br/>\n<br/>\n4 - I decided to use the rule for stunts that Eric published on his blog and which uses "awesome tokens". I kept Daring as the Attribute to obtain these tokens and told to the players that they had to describe "stunts", dangerous moves or graphically powerfull actions to deserve a roll. Since the tokens are the only way to improve at will your chances to hit and to make higher damage this led to both player attributing their best score to Daring. Perhaps something to fix there too. Daring realy seems like the must-have-a-good-score attribute of the bunch.<br/>\n<br/>\n(continued in next post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F" title="Antoine_F"><img alt="Antoine_F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F">Antoine_F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108617/#Comment_108617" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-16T16:42:03+00:00" title="November 16, 2007  4:42PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The prep<br/>\n<br/>\nTo prep for the game I used the oracle from the Cheap and Cheesy Fantasy Game by Vincent Baker (here : http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=218). I rolled a couple oracles two weeks ago while we were visiting my wife's father and kept them in a note book. When I had to prepare the game, I picked one, extracted the characters and used them to generate NPCs and a backstory, following the advices from Eric in the RBH and or a method akin to Trollbabe's preping. There was a situation on the verge of  disaster, NPCs with strong desires and who wanted the PCs to help them reach their goal or far away from their path. I created the stats for a monster which was at the center of the conflict, some NPCs with their relationships and names. I also noted some exemples of fight arenas that could fit the environnement of the game, for each type of arena in the game. And there was a treasure too, a jeweled dagger and someone who had already stole it. And go !<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game itself. We played on sunday afternoon after our 2 years old daughter Jeanne went to bed. J\xe9r\xf4me had to drive back home early so we played about 3 hours. I think I could have made things go faster because we only had one conflict, at the end of the session. But we played iw a kind of "sandbox" way. The players were both fully engaged in the game, interacting with NPCs, reveling in their role of strongest guys in the place. I think the game makes for fun characters and both players had a good time just immersing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conflict was a fight between the PCs (the three of them since J\xe9r\xf4me had the two brothers split up along the way) and a bunch of mercenaries who were paid to stop them from interfering into an exorcism. The players entered realy well in the fight. They already had the experience of Beast Hunters challenge resolution. So they realy seized the stunt system to gain tokens. Marie used Louise's talent of Puppet String to generate all sorts of hazards for the NPCs, with chairs sneaking behind the opponent back to make them fall, curtains tangling around the head of the enemies, etc... With his large size, J\xe9r\xf4me's PC used dead ennemies to throw at the comrades. They used the awesome tokens to give bonuses to one another when needed. Simply said, the combat was fast and a lot of fun. One of the Alex went down, dead, and the second one also fell at 0 HP but he had his immunity to death. Louise was the only PC left standing after the fight and she managed to make the NPC's boss go away with a scary entrance on the exocism scene and a strong speech (using the rules for non-combat conflicts and the Eloquence attribute). It was at this point that I regretted not to have the Stubbornness attribute for my NPC, to oppose Louise's Eloquence... You'll note that, as the system rewards the player for letting NPCs go away alive, she gained some XP for that. I think this NPC will make a great villain for a later game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're interested in the backstory I used in the prep here were the elements : a sorcerer who commited suicide, tired of his shame and mediocrity. He still can't find rest because his wooden gargoyle homonculus is on the loose, ripping channelers and sorcerers hearts out to sustain it's existence. The sorcerer's ghost now possess the body of a merchant and tries to find and stop the monster. The merchant's wife understood that someone had swaped with her husband when he stopped beating her at night and started to act nicely. The merchant brother, a mercenary captain who was fighting far away from home and who is now back, heard of his brother transformation and started to have some suspicion of possession. There's a big market at a crossroad with a lot of mercenaries hired to protect the merchants. Some of them are channelers.The gargoyle start to kill every single channeler to consume their heart. And there are decorative wooden gargoyles everywhere on the market : it's kind of a tradition of this particular fair... The PC are mercenaries. They are at the market. One of them is a channeler. Oh and there are some other NPCs : the apprentice of an exorcist who is a bit too zealous and hired by the brother to cast the ghost out, a female Fox merchant who has a hobby of stealing dead people goods (notably the ghost sorcerer jeweled dagger), a sad and angry mercenary bear who lost his channeler prot\xe9g\xe9, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n(continued in next post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F" title="Antoine_F"><img alt="Antoine_F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F">Antoine_F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108618/#Comment_108618" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-16T16:42:40+00:00" title="November 16, 2007  4:42PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The system<br/>\n<br/>\nI can say that I like the system in general, but I'll concentrate on one aspect. It even was a topic of discussion here those last few days :<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes combat fun in the RBH ?<br/>\n- character construction : all the mechanical aspects of the characters, attributes, talents, weapons and armor can form "combos" (to use a trading card game analogy) but way more simply that any d20 game.<br/>\n- choices : each round you only have one action and you have to choose well. You can strike or you can build your advantage (by using stunts, a talent or by moving to a favorable combat zones). If it reminds you of Beast Hunters, it did to me too. And I am a great fan of Beast Hunters system.<br/>\n- meaningfull narration : I already talked about stunts, didn't I ? Basicaly, your chance to hit in combat don't improve mecanicaly. There's no Attribute which gives a straight bonus to your attack roll. Some talents do that, but you don't have that much talents. You have to describe a stunt and then you can roll your Daring to get some "awesome tokens" to boost your roll or your damage. During the game, it played a lot like the challenge system of Beast Hunters (with the difference that the GM don't juge the quality of your stunt : you roll your Daring and the degree of success will tell you how good you were).<br/>\n- short rounds that make for good participation around the table : you roll for initiative, but that done real fast, and then there's only an attack roll. No defense roll, no soak roll, no damage roll. Just the next turn of awesome narration.<br/>\n- interest into other players' action because of the possibility to give another player your "awesome tokens" or some creative use of arenas or talents.<br/>\n<br/>\nEric if you read this post, this is what I'd like to see for now :<br/>\n- a more precisely described set of attributes.<br/>\n- some precision about the non combat part and the way it can trump combat (can you scare away an opponent, convince him to come on your  side, etc..?)<br/>\n- some precision on the way monsters and NPCs can boost their chances to hit : do they use the stunt rules too (I don't think so) ? Do they only use the arenas and the rare awesome token resulting from a stunt failure from a PC ?<br/>\n- do you use the armor class ratings of the PDF or the ones on the "Too much whiff" article of the blog ?<br/>\n- a way to balance the monsters with the PCs.<br/>\n- some way to make descriptions matters in non-combat conflicts in the way stunts do for combat. But perhaps the way it's now is not a bug but a feature...<br/>\n<br/>\nTo wrap it all : I think that this game deserve more than to be just a hack. It's a game in its own rights. I love to play gamist and to step-on-up. Beast Hunters indulge the "stretch you imagination" aspect of this urge but I have searched for a long time a RPG that could do something that games like Iron Heroes kept promising, with options, crunch and cool powers, but in a simple way that doesn't require to spend 3 weeks reading the book, one month making a character and one year making NPC for prep. I think I found it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Eric.<br/>\n<br/>\nAntoine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108810/#Comment_108810" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T04:43:46+00:00" title="November 19, 2007  4:43AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

That gives some variety to combat, as players use their different attributes in different ways in combat. For instance, maybe Stubborness is not just for holding your argument in debate, but also for holding off a monster during a fight.<br/><br/>-Did Daring really dominate play? If your system is based around improvised "stunts", it just _sounds_ logical that Daring would be the attribute rolled, pretty much all the time--after all, "stunts" are acts of "daring", pretty much by definition.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to more Red Box Hack! I hope there will be an updated PDF soon.<br/><br/>And I love the "homunculus" ability! (One question: if the "twin" dies, does that mean the character can no longer split into two--i.e. loses the ability?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108873/#Comment_108873" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T12:23:03+00:00" title="November 19, 2007 12:23PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Antoine, good to see you around these parts <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>That sounds like a great time.

I only have a half assed answer for that.  See, I wrote the rule expecting that monsters could use it too.  But, at the same time, my AP experience has shown me that I don't really want to bother with that crap for monsters.  What I want for monsters are special abilities that kick more ass than the current ones.<br/><br/><b><i>do you use the armor class ratings of the PDF or the ones on the "Too much whiff" article of the blog [to see how many awesome tokens you get] ?</i></b><br/><br/>Use the "Too much whiff" version.

He was therefore very upset (and became quite berserk) when he saw his brother die, but not completely desperate because he knew this was not definitive.<br/><br/>We had to stop the episode just after this fight, but we should try and finish next week-end I hope. The surviving Alex is therefore still at 0HP, with 2 days in bed to come back to a mere 4HP (I started at 8 because of one of my talent), with no possibility to split again till next episode (basically, I have lost both my talents!). And the "main adversary" has not even be really encountered (much less fought) up to now... both my PC falled against simple "minions". Hence my conclusions: this is a very deadly game, and PC are not very strong with respect to NPC (even minor ones, since they have the same basic HP - even my "monster Daring" didn't save me); uneven fights are really dangerous (the fight in which my PC falled was 3 PC against 4 NPC); but this is a very fun game to play, and quite efficient despite its apparent "simplicity" (as already said by Antoine). I really enjoyed our 3h of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F" title="Antoine_F"><img alt="Antoine_F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F">Antoine_F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109128/#Comment_109128" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T07:28:58+00:00" title="November 21, 2007  7:28AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi to all, thanks for the welcome, interest and aswers.<br/><br/>To Christian:<br/>Hi <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I've wanted to come for a long time. The next game account will be of  Beast Hunters. Like I said, I am a huge fan. But I think, it will be in french and on a french RPG forum. BH deserves more visibility here.<br/><br/>To Eric :<br/>Thanks for the aswers. They all make sense to me.<br/>J\xe9r\xf4me already said we used your solution for the twin homonculus death.<br/>And I totaly agree with you about the GM not having to bother with using stunts and stuff for NPCs. The "spotlight" is for the PCs ! And I imagine having to describe stunts for every adversary...<br/>I am looking forward to the abilities you can find to make the opposition more interesting (and to every other modification also). If I come up with ideas on my own, I'll report them.<br/><br/>I also thought of something, inspired by the way Dread manage clues about demons and by something Rob Harper (Valvoric) said in another thread (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4818&amp;page=1#Item_16" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4818&amp;page=1#Item_16</a>) :\n<blockquote><cite><br/>You can take D&amp;D a long way into "player-centered" activity [...] but I think "the high altar of the demon god chamber" is the heart of where players want the GM to "surprise them with something cool that maybe with great player skills they could have seen coming".<br/></cite></blockquote>\nI'll tell you how it went If I can use it.<br/><br/>To Paul :<br/>Concerning the use of different attributes for "stunts" : I stayed close to the initial use of Daring presented in the PDF. I think Eric initially wanted each attribute to have a specific effect on the game (though, I cant' find where I read it now...) and stunts were the specific effect of Daring. But I can totally see how you could use every attribute, with different kind of narrations, to get the tokens. You could test it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Concerning the PCs mortality problem that J\xe9r\xf4me outlined, I think I am the first to blame. The NPCs I aligned weren't exactly the average mook. With high awarness, they often hit first, they out numbered the PCs and I rolled an insanely high number of 10 on my face die (resulting in more demage). And more important, I think I didn't presented the arenas the players could use clearly enough. So next time, I know what to do. And with luck, next time will be saturday or sunday ! We are blowing up our gaming sessions stats lately.<br/><br/>You can expect news after that.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Antoine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F" title="Antoine_F"><img alt="Antoine_F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F">Antoine_F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109839/#Comment_109839" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T10:22:16+00:00" title="November 27, 2007 10:22AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We finished our game last sunday.<br/><br/>There were a lot of interactions with the NPCs and we had two fights with the monsters (the gargoyle and the mate it created from a wooden statue and the hearts of his channelers victims). On the first, the players prepared a trap for the gargoyle with ropes and fire, so they had an rather easy win. But they didn't see the second one coming and we had an open fight. We used a little more of the arenas rules then. I think both were good fight scenes.<br/><br/>We used the target numbers by Armor Class given in the "too much whiff" article which lowers the to-hit numbers. As a secondary result, there was far more "awesome tokens" in play because the same numbers are used as targets for the stunts. There was less "whiff" than last time and I think that the few misses that occured where meaninfull and fun. The interactions between PCs, with the possibility to give the tokens to another player worked realy great. This part of the game is a blast !<br/><br/>A side note about stunts : as I see them, the stunts are an occasion to show off. You don't gain bonuses because the stunt helps your linked action (in a "realistic" way) but because you attracted attention to you and made the combat scene more interesting. Doing so validates your status as the star of the show. Thus, it earns you some mechanical way to shine. I love it that way.<br/><br/>Hotness wasn't used at all and Eloquence only because I called for a few rolls. I think I'll have to play more games to see how the social conflicts can work. For now, I don't know if the original set of attributes (including charisma, fleetness and wits instead of hotness, stubborness and eloquence) wouldn' work better for my group.<br/><br/>For the moment, I don't think allowing other attributes than Daring into the Stunt system would be good (because what would be the reason to have a high Daring if you can do the same thing with size AND have the encumbrance capacity ?). I think the solution is to give more importance to the other attributes in their specific fields.<br/><br/>To sum up, the game was good, I had lots of fun and I think the players did too but I need to improve some things to make it realy great :<br/>- make more interesting monsters like Eric already said. The balance is realy tough to find between ruling over the PCs (like I did last time) and being absolutly dominated by them (as I felt this time).<br/>- throw more conflicts at the PCs or at least create more opportunities for conflict.<br/>- find better way to articulate the treasures into the adventure. In this game, I almost acted as if the treasure was the reward for the other actions (killing the monster, protecting some NPCs...). I think that, at some point in the game, the treasure must appear clearly as THE THING TO STEAL - PERIOD. It's not a byproduct. Stealing a treasure can be like the "tower of the elephant" for Conan. It's not trivial. It's adventuring per se.<br/><br/>I plan to prepare some games in advance and see if I can run them at a notice for any group of players/PCs.<br/>Each prep would come with : some locations descriptions, a backstory including some NPCs with an agenda, at least a monster integrated in the backstory and/or locations, a list of names, a list of ideas for possible arenas. Maybe some maps with arenas and barriers (but more as an exercice than to use at all cost).<br/><br/>As I said I think RBH is a very good game. I know that Eric works on the "weak" points (attributes and such...) now but I can't wait to play more. Eric, know that I am realy looking forward to the modifications you are writing ! With a solid set of attributes, a simple description of how arenas work and sound advices on how a GM can prep, I think a lot of people would love it even for an initiation game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109901/#Comment_109901" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T16:17:37+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  4:17PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again, Antoine.

However, you must consider that we had issues of time: we have had our hands full with the various adversaries (that damned GM throw at us a *second monster* as we all thought it was over after the first!), and I had to leave to come back home, so it left very little time to handle the stealing of the treasure. We all knew that, and I think that's why Antoine (which is not damned as I can say) did not extend too much on this last part of the adventure.<br/><br/>I also felt that there was an equilibrium problem with the adversary. During our first session, we fought 4 "minions" (bodyguards) which hurt us pretty bad, as explained above; during the second session, we fought the two "main monsters" (gargoyles, the basis of the adventure), and though the fight was funny et captivating, it felt not really hard or dangerous (0 loss of hit point in the first fight, 3-4 hp lost (*cumulating both loss* of the PC) during the second fight). I don't feel these second fights were easier than the first just because we (the PC) were, by the time, more used to the tokens system. I haven't read the system, but perhaps there should be various levels of opposition: a "minion" level and a "monster" level; the "minion" level could be inspired by Spirit of the Century: each minion is not very strong by itself, but a group of 2-3 minions is of the level of a "monster": this way, we could have fights involving 1 PC vs 2-3 bodyguards (or such) which would be interesting without being deadly for the PC (which, as heroes, could fight 2-3 minions without being completely overloaded). <br/><br/>I don't know how Antoine felt about mastering the fights with the gargoyles (the "big monsters" of the story), but it seems to me that, compared with the PC options, the GM options are very little; once he had built the opposition with its powers which seems to give "passive" advantages (more hp, better weapons, etc.), I have the feeling that the GM can only make the adversaries try and hit the PC (or perhaps try to move the fight to a better arena). I am wondering if, in comparison with the tokens system used by the PC, this does not make the fight a little bit boring for the GM. Perhaps transfering the token system to monsters is a bit too much (the PC remaining the heroes of the story), but allowing the GM to have something "gamist" to play with is not a bad idea. Some games (Beast Hunter among them, I believe) use the idea of a "general pool" the GM uses along the story to build the opposition; perhaps using this idea of "general pool" to RBH: the GM does not have to "show off" by having the monster make stunts to gain a pool, he simply has one and only one pool for the whole session, which he can use to have the adversaries gain bonuses during an opposition.<br/><br/>I have talked above only about weak points (in my opinion) of RBH, but this was because I feel this game has a lot of potential and, as Antoine, I am eager to see and test further versions. I really enjoyed our two sessions, and the token system is indeed awesome for PC (especially the possibility to give the tokens (*), and the choices we have to make, each round, between hitting or earning tokens).<br/><br/>To sum up: great game, keep on working on it Eric!<br/><br/><br/>(*) a particular powerful combo with the "Homonculus" power: split in two, then have one character earn token each round which he gives to the other character to hit the bad guy. This is, however, not an "absolute" combo since the splitting of HP is really a drawback; although my character also has the "scar armor" (3 more HP than the normal PC), when split in two each character becomes quite mortal... as the very first fight showed me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113065/#Comment_113065" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T18:43:42+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  6:43PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hiya Jerome.
