                    Well, I've almost got my group firmed up for The Mountain Witch, and we're planning on running the first session on the 28th.  Scheduling's been a bear, and I've still got two players (one of whom is my boyfriend...) getting back into the city that evening, so hopefully we will actually be able to start on time.  Dave, my boyfriend, is the least experienced of us, and is good-naturedly trying my patience, trying to find out what abilities he can and can't have.  I finally gave him the book and told him to get it out of his system before Thursday. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  It's looking like I will definitely have five players, hopefully six.  I was a little disappointed because two of the women I game with were really excited about the game, but then one had to bail, and the other one's been incommunicado, so it might be me and the boys.  This is no big deal, except that the other women were initially very excited about one of us actually GMing, so I'm bummed they won't be able to take part.<br/><br/>I'm planning on the first session being pretty relaxed.  I figure we'll order food, I'll give them a quick run-down of the way the game works (explain Dark Fates, Trust, etc.), and then we'll do chargen.  I'm going to randomly assign the Fates and the Zodiac signs.<br/><br/>I'm torn as to whether to do a demo conflict, or just kick off the session with a battle so that we can get hands-on experience with the system.  I'll probably just ask and see what people are more comfortable with, but do you folks have any suggestions?<br/><br/>One of the ideas for kicking off the session I've seen elsewhere that I'm going to steal is to have each player introduce his/her character as though we're watching them at the beginning of a movie.  I'm going to tell them that, having received the commission to kill the Mountain Witch, their character is travelling to meet with the other ronin, or is in some way preparing themself for the mission.  Then I'll tell them to describe what their character is doing, how they look, etc.  I'll probably explicitly frame it as "the musical montage at the beginning of a movie" or "the opening credits" or something.<br/><br/><i>Kwaidan</i> has been invaluable in coming up with cool bangs, as has the Obakemono Project.  Seriously, I wish that every RPG came with something like <i>Kwaidan</i>.  Brilliant -- not only are the stories excellent for monsters and situations, the descriptions are beautiful and will come in handy for setting the mood.  I'm definitely going to make use of the story about the rokuro-kubi with detachable heads that float around in the garden catching bugs.  There's also a really cool story involving a man who rescues a kite from some boys who are tormenting it, only to find out that the bird is really a tengu in bird form.  I think that's going to show up at some point.<br/><br/>I've been holding off on any strong ideas about who O-Yanma is and what motivates him, which makes me a little nervous, but I suspect that letting the players' reactions and narration shape this is probably a good idea.  I mean, I've got some vague ideas, but nothing firm yet.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm mostly just talking out loud here, trying to organize my thoughts.                </div>

                            Hi there Kirsten,<br/><br/>I think the montage will be great. We started our Witch game with much the same technique and it worked really well. <br/><br/>I wouldn't do a demo conflict myself, just kick in with a conflict that isn't too challenging and let them get to grips. I think it's hard to get a sense of how trust works outside of the game-in-motion, and to be honest that's the subtle part of the system - other than that, it's more or less 'what do you want to do?' what do they want to do? Higher roller gets what they want!' The nuances you can get at in play - after all, you are never required to take aichi (sp? - converting a draw to mutual wounds)  so they can play careful until comfortable with how annoying flesh or chapter wounds are for them.                        </div>

                            Just a data point: <br/><br/>I've been running a successful game of TMW recently, that started with them describing their ronin in the dawn light, and the first scene wasn't a conflict at all (I had a warrior nun meet them at a shrine on the way, with a letter... I let them decide which of them recognised her - fortunately none of them recognised her as <i>Tomoe Gozen</i> ;-) - and what the letter contained. It worked well as an introduction to the idea that the players were supposed to come up with stuff on their own.<br/><br/>For subsequent scenes, I wrote short descriptions intended to be evocative and the name of the person/demon/spirit that they were going to encounter, and just winged it. After the first session, I was able to pick opposition more carefully to match the intimations of the characters' Dark Fates.<br/><br/>One final note you might find useful as a springboard for incorporating environmental effects into the game: One of the players was on pager rotation for the first session. There was no way around it, and he would have to deal with it (people like to <a href="http://checkout.google.com/" rel="nofollow">shop</a> uninterrupted), so I gave him a cat. I let every play pick what colour they saw the cat as, and had it disappear at the end of the first session (which was overnight IG), and turn up again in the second session as a bakeneko animating the corpses of a few people they met in the first session. Fun times!<br/><br/>Have fun with TMW - the more, as GM, you get the players to do the creative work of foreshadowing their characters' DFs (and later their players' plans) the easier it gets for you to provide appropriate satisfying opposition.                        </div>
