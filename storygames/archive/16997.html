Recently I decided to make it a futuristic spy game. Something between Serenity and Star Wars mixed with Mission Impossible and peppered with some Shadowrun. <br/><br/>The pull is very strong towards the spy angle. The gist is that there is a cold war going on between two interstellar factions. The team was trained by one of the factions to infiltrate enemy territory and conduct espionage/sabotage missions. I think Mission Impossible's over the top action fits really well in a space adventure like Star Wars. <br/><br/>I'm almost ready to go into alpha testing for it, but Before I do, I want to get some last minute setting ideas. Specifically, what tropes and thematic elements do you think would be necessary for a game to feel like a spy adventure? Cover identities, moles, wide-reaching plots, etc. I've got a pretty good idea, and so far I've had no problems blending setting with mechanics, but just in case...<br/><br/>Thanks for your help.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386436/#Comment_386436" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T05:14:40+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  5:14AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you want futuristic Le Carre... or Bond?  Mission Impossible the TV show falls somewhere in the middle, as sometimes the missions are pretty small scale (remove a mole, make a switch of a recording so the bad guys have the false info they think is correct).   I think it makes a difference and so it could go either way.  A game that is trying to do somewhat "realistic" (ie low body count, dealing with own organization's bureacracy and turf defending) could be really, really cool.  But having cosmic martini's while donning insta-tux while paragliding from orbit is its own kind of fun and probably much easier to do in an RPG.<br/><br/>But a list of tropes?<br/>*Double crossed by your bosses is a classic... Bourne Identity, 3 days of the Condor in SPAAAAAACEEE!!<br/>* Cover identities could have low level telepathic implants as well as sophisticated chameleon surgery to actually BECOME the role.  The Agent actually believes he/she is the cover identity.<br/>* Some thought should go into how war (space naval) is conducted... so are there giant fleets of drydock ships, can espionage be overt (blowing up drydock ships).<br/>*  Is there some galacticNET and hacking more powerful?  Or is an internet pretty much confined to one planet or system.  <br/>*  Super stealthy...but super expensive teleportation (for a more Bondian side of the genre).  Great for getting behind enemy lines.  <br/>*  Cold War needs a border.  Some kind of dimensional wall?<br/>*  Missions aimed at preserving the status quo at times...which means working with the other side when your own side's other agency(ies) have done something to the balance<br/>*  Orbital embassies!<br/>*   System S-Bombs.  As in one bomb takes out an entire solar system.  <br/>*  Contact lenses that are recording cameras (took this one from Stand Alone Complex...a show I highly recommend for its political oriented cybernetic police procedural).<br/>*  Seducing alien princesses to work for your side.  Or alien princes.  <br/>*  Bugging a key intel satellite to show what your side wants, without the other side knowing that their trillion dollar satellite has been compromised.<br/>*  Neuro paralysers as thin, evening wear gloves<br/>*  micro everything.  Flash drives in earrings.  Programmable hallucinagenics in cufflink.  Communications in ones jawbone.  ECCM implanted in hipbone.  <br/><br/>Hows that to start?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386456/#Comment_386456" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T08:51:54+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  8:51AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's perfect. I've accounted for some of them, but you've obviously watched more spy movies than I have, lol. It would definitely be the Bond side of the genre. <br/><br/>One of my players had the idea of a character in the group being a spy for the other side; everyone would pick a personal mission card, kind of like keys in Lady Blackbird, and one of the cards would be "Mole!". I wasn't sure about the group dynamics, but your idea of working with the other side on occasion to maintain the status quo would allow for them to play the other side without the potential for nasty PvP.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386459/#Comment_386459" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T09:28:52+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  9:28AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...one of the cards would be "Mole!".</blockquote>See the Battlestar Galatica board game rules for the Cylon(s) or the special rules for "Who Is The Killer?" in the Fiasco playset <a href="http://bullypulpitgames.com/wiki/index.php?title=Camp_Death_Appendix" rel="nofollow">Camp Death</a>.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386461/#Comment_386461" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T09:51:59+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  9:51AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That would make for a great reveal at a critical turning point, and would work splendidly with a plot map. At a certain time, GM rolls for a new plot point and finds "Mole!". Everyone rolls a die and in the climax, that character is revealed as a mole. <br/><br/>This seems like instant death for the PC though. What if someone really likes there character and mole comes up? I know I'd be thrown a little if a character I put a lot of work into was thrown out so easily.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386467/#Comment_386467" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T10:13:17+00:00" title="August  6, 2012 10:13AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, given the group dynamics, James Bond styled movies always focused on one player, this would probably be closer to the A-Team.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386631/#Comment_386631" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-08T05:58:20+00:00" title="August  8, 2012  5:58AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an A-team situation, I think niche protection for each "role" would be important.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
