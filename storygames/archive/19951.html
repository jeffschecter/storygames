Instead of playing people who embark on an adventure, I want to focus on people who find themselves in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Maybe it is in time of apocalypse, or you find yourself on a faulty spaceship, basically, I want to focus on trying to survive in a hostile environment. It would be somehow inspired by survival horror video games like This War of Mine, State of Decay or even something like Silent Hill.<br/><br/>While I want resource management to play a part, I want the main focus of the game to be the frailty of humans. To do this I want to use a mechanic similar to the "general skills" from gumshoe:<br/>Skills have a numeric value, that is also a pool of points. You can spend those points on your roll, but only before the roll and without knowing the exact Target Number. Points spent refresh only under certain conditions. This spending of one's resources would be the central mechanic supplementing the survivalist theme.<br/><br/>Refreshing those skills would rely on things like food, water, sleep, etc. This would add the resource management layer to the game, but not complexity or number crunching normally associated with resource management. <br/><br/>Gumshoe uses single d6 roll for that. Which I think is not a bad option, although I want to add some narrative aspects to the game. To do this, I am thinking about adding the mechanic from Freeform Universal. For each thing that helps you, add a bonus die. For each thing that hinders you, add a penalty die. Bonus and penalty dice cancel each other out, and depending on what type of dice you are left with you either take the lowest or the highest of the bunch. Giving you a range between 1-6 +whatever points you have spent. <br/><br/>Do you think this would be a decent mechanic for a survival game? I am concerned that this might make players rely more on their equipment (that can give extra dice) than on their own abilities (points from skills). <br/>I like the idea of bonus/penalty dice, as any harm to the characters can be expressed as penalty dice.<br/>To kinda nerf the importance of bonus dice I am thinking of making some equipment faulty, so it would give you a bonus die, but also a penalty (-1 or -2 to the roll's total). But I think this might just add unwanted complexity (bonus/penalty dice and modifiers seems a bit much). What do you think guys?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441198/#Comment_441198" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-06T11:33:15+00:00" title="January  6, 2015 11:33AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This system would work well but dice mechanics like this is such a small part of what matters at the table.

I am only on brainstorming stages of this project and I might not have all the answers... yet <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/>This is what I have decided so far:<br/><br/>The GM does not roll dice. This approach reinforces the theme, at least in my mind. Players are pitted against odds that are basically obstacles to their survival. It is up to the player to somehow overcome the [strong][knife wielding] guy who wants his stuff. This also forces the player to spend more skill points, showing how fleeting his/her strengths are.<br/><br/>To regain skill points, you need some normal "quiet time". Sit down, have something to eat, chat with your friends, sleep. To do this, players need to secure at least some food, water and somewhere to rest their head. This is again up to the players to find those resources, and running out of them is one of the situations that will trigger play. Because, you want to be in a good shape, when shit hits the fan.<br/><br/>And shit will hit the fan. It is GM's job to simulate this hostile environment and I will write a chapter on doing just that. Things break down, people get sick etc. This way, the players will have to find solutions to those problems to survive.<br/><br/>I am also toying with the idea of motivations for the player characters. Either something akin to keys from TSOY or just custom objectives per player (I used this technique for experience in other games, detailed <a href="http://level27geek.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-session-achievement-alternative.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Achieving an objective would refresh your skill points. <br/><br/>A lot of what triggers play would depend on the scenario. I want to create a "survival simulator" that you can use in different scenarios, spanning different genres. I think, that making personalized and group objectives, as described in the link, would be a good way to trigger play in any scenario.<br/><br/>Some follow up questions:<br/>What scenarios come to your mind, when you think survival in wrong place, wrong time?<br/>As a GM, what tools would you need/want, to run such game?<br/>How do you feel about player conflict in such games                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441205/#Comment_441205" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-06T17:06:32+00:00" title="January  6, 2015  5:06PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, a "survival game" is going to be something that balances environmental pressures against available tools and resources. Having just finished <i>The Martian</i>, I can confidently say that the excitement came from surprise mistakes/system failures and the subsequent intense time pressures to resolve the situation and then continue on task (get to a site where he can get off Mars).<br/><br/>I have no idea how you can do that without either extensive tables customized to simulate particular environment(s) -OR- a clever GM in an adversarial role (i.e., GM "wins" if the player's characters all die, but 'loses' if the players think he or she was irrationally unfair--viz the semi-cooperative "objectives" in the pyramid game Zendo).<br/><br/>I'd also consider how to gamify rescue efforts. Perhaps a three-way game: GM as environmental adversary, players as survivors, and players as search-and-rescuers (as appropriate). Lots of incomplete information to wade through; easy to go off in wrong direction or over-anticipate the survivors' likely actions! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Once all that's in place, look to ways to put the survivors (and rescuers?!) into inter-adversarial postures: there's never quite enough; each player has an incomplete picture of what it takes to survive and escape; players might even be slightly out of control of their characters, to reflect delirium, malnutrition, oxygen starvation, injuries that impact cognition (head, high-pain). Finally got enough water? Good, that's when Joe decides he'd better be in charge of the filtration, to ration it and, dammit, because he thought to pack it!<br/><br/>You capture most or all of those types of interactions, pressures, and tensions (especially time, somehow!) and you've got at least one sale!

I might need to research some mechanics of good survival video games to decide that.<br/><br/>The timer can also work as a Threat level. So the longer you stay, the more dangerous it gets (like an army approaching, space ship breaking down etc.) Mechanically this threat can be expressed in growing Difficulty Number for tests.<br/><br/>Randomized "shit" can be done easily without going into specific scenarios by using oracles similar to those from <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Oracle-Cards-verified.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Quiet Year</a>. <br/><br/>Yeah, I had the two different agendas in mind: get out or establish a safehouse.

The amount of different skills was a bit cumbersome, especially when it comes to refreshing them.  In gumshoe most of the skills are refreshed only at the end of adventure, so it's not a problem there. When it comes to refreshing skills every couple scenes, it gets fiddly. <br/><br/>I have changed the mechanic to the following:<br/><br/>You have a few (possibly 3) descriptors for your character. Those work like in FU (ability to  give you an extra die). This reinforces the fact that the character you play is an everyman and not a hero. <br/><br/>You have a pool of points (20?) called Endurance. This is a combined stat of your Stamina, Willpower, Hope and other things that make the character want to survive. You can spend those points on 1 to 1 basis to add to your roll. <br/><br/>You can choose few skills in how have you learnt to cope with the situation you found yourself in. Skills like: running away, athletics, stealth, etc. You buy them with the endurance points. For every endurance point, you get 2 skill points. So let's say you spend 3 endurance on running away and 2 on stealth. This gives you: Endurance 15, running away 6, stealth 4. You can use your endurance for any test, skill points only where it makes sense.<br/><br/>You roll against an unknown Target Number. You roll 1d6 and then add bonus and penalty dice, like in FU. You choose the highest die.
