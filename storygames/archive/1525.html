                    One difference that strikes me between many indie designs and many trad designs (without for the moment worrying too much about definitions for the sake of all our sanities) is that many indie games give thought to the likely duration of play.<br/><br/>What do I mean by that?  I don't mean the individual session, I mean they give thought to how long a given play experience, campaign for want of a better term, should be under that system.<br/><br/>Many go for closed story arcs, the idea is that you play out a particular story and if you wish may play out a related story later but that story is self-contained and done.<br/><br/>By contrast, most trad games in my experience don't really think about campaign duration.  The assumption is that it is open-ended, potentially indefinite.  I think that misses a trick, I think if desired campaign length was taken into account it might lead to better gaming.<br/><br/>Desired campaign length might well be open ended, fair enough, but if so that has design implications.  Desired campaign length might be one night of play, again that has implications.  A game might see a desired campaign length as being around two years of weekly play, this is the assumption behind DnD 3.5, and I think it is a stronger game for having given clear thought to how long it is likely to be played for and incorporating design elements supporting that duration of play.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I'm being quite clear, so I'll try some examples.<br/><br/>Pendragon is designed for extended, but not indefinite, campaign play.  It supports this through use of a defined timeline, through rules for families and continuing play through multiple generations, it has given a lot of thought to actively supporting the extended duration play it aims for.<br/><br/>DnD 3.5 is aimed as I said above at two years of weekly play.  Accordingly, how quickly you level is calculated so that if you play on that basis by the time you finish you will have experienced each facet of the game, from beginning character to uber-PC at 20th level.  Campaign duration is again an intentional design feature.<br/><br/>My Life with Master is designed for a single play session, and the rules support that and pretty much guarantee you a successful play experience in that timeframe.<br/><br/>Dogs is designed to provide satisfactory play with one town, though you can should you wish go on to another town if the mood takes you.  Again, duration is factored in.<br/><br/>But most games don't do this, most games vaguely assume open ended play and then don't really think through the implications of that and so don't really support open ended play.<br/><br/>Note, I'm not saying open ended is better than closed or short better than long or anything like that, what I'm saying is that I think the expected duration of a particular game is a design feature that is not thought about enough and that has potential to make better games if factored in.<br/><br/>Not sure if this is quite the right forum for this, but does anyone get what I mean and agree/disagree?                </div>

Fair question, what I was thinking about is the kind of tools that help shape this and how one can better apply them.  What the factors are that encourage one type of duration from another.                        </div>

                            Actually, I think there's a more important question to be asked, though it may be a thread-jack (let me know if it is).  Specifically, what <i>advantages</i> do you get in long-term play?  I think the advantages of short-term play were pretty well covered in Tony's 'social footprint' threads a couple of weeks ago: they are low commitment.  It's easy to commit to a game or two, and you get your satisfaction right there in those two sessions (rather than waiting for a 'big payoff' at the end).<br/><br/>But people (like me) still want longer-form games.  Why is that?  What is it about long-form games that makes them better (and what are they better at) than short-form games?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            It's a threadjack, but it's an interesting threadjack so all's well.<br/><br/>I'll come back to it, I have some definite ideas on the benefits of longer games as opposed to the benefit of shorter games, but will need a bit more time to formulate them properly.                        </div>

                            Techniques:<br/><br/>Heavily front-loaded work (creating the characters, creating the world, playing through levels 1-5 to get to the good stuff) encourages ... nay <i>requires</i>! ... a long-term campaign in order to capitalize on it.  Contrariwise, reducing that start-up cost increases your ability to play short games.<br/><br/>Changing the nature of characters and situation, and particularly confronting extant conflicts in the situation is part and parcel of coming to the completion of an arc.  You don't have to end the story once you confront the conflicts (you can continue with some new ones!) but you <i>do</i> have to confront the conflicts in order to end the story, at least in a satisfying manner.  So a system which makes the main conflicts distant and untouchable ("Kill these three thousand orc minions of the evil overlord ... not that it will change the world, because he's got lots more!") make it easy to continue a campaign in the long term, whereas a system which drops the main conflicts right in your lap and expects you to deal with them ("This town is rife with sin.  Fix it!") makes it hard to continue the campaign, and easy to finish it quickly.<br/><br/>Those are the two that leap to mind for me.  Damn fine question, though!  I look forward to hearing other people's responses.                        </div>

                            To me, there's a difference when it comes to emotional investment.<br/><br/>If I come to the table and <i><b>say</b></i> that Okhfels has a dark past, and that he used to be a gangster, but now he's trying to put that all behind him, and he's in love for the first time, REALLY in love, and he's all romantic, but he doesn't know that his lady has a past as dark or darker than his, and in fact she's a murderous wench as well, but she loves him too... <br/><br/>It just doesn't mean as much as if we <i><b>PLAY</b></i> all that, through ten sessions, establishing the foundations for the conflicts in play... wow.

Ah, thanks for the correction.  Interestingly that means I've played it wrong, though it was at a con.<br/><br/>The point remains anyway, it is designed with a play duration in mind.                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>I'm not Fred, but I would suggest that it is the simple reality of time spent that long-form play allows you to show <i>more</i> stuff during play.  That said, I've played lots of short-form stuff that was heavy on the show, and light on the tell, and had a lot of fun doing it.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            I think there isn't enough time, in a short game, to build up a large mass of things that have been shown.<br/><br/>For me, each thing that has been shown before, adds a proportion of its strength to the next related thing that is shown.  Things that have been told do not.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at, is this:<br/><br/>The moment, when Okhfels went to Isadora, and confessed his dark past, only to find that her blade was dripping blood from having just stabbed her best friend in the back, and that they found that they were still in love anyways... <br/><br/>That moment wouldn't have been nearly as powerful if it had been played during the first session of the game.

                            Fred, that sounds (to me) like saying "Movies are never as dramatic as TV shows, because a TV show has hours upon hours to establish things.  A movie is just like watching the first and second episode.  You hardly get to see anything at all."<br/><br/>Is there a reason why (say) three hours of an RPG session isn't enough time to show all the stuff you need in order to get a powerful statement, if that's what you set out to do?  I'd be very surprised to hear that it can't be done, since I do it all the time.                        </div>

                            Actually, Tony, to me.... a long-running quality TV show, with powerful story arcs and well written characters (a rarity these days, but it happens) <i>is</i> more dramatic to me than an equally well-written movie.  <br/><br/>Yes, Tony... three hours IS enough time to get to ONE powerful statement.  And if all you want is just one powerful statement... then good.  I find that one powerful statement usually raises one or more questions, kind of the way the resolution of one Dogs town implies another... and I'm never satisfied when a story "ends" because I want to know what happens next.<br/><br/>In the final battle of Lord of the Rings (the movie) after watching six DVD's full of action, all kinds of things run through my head.<br/><br/>"Did that big troll that was about to cut off Aragorn's head get away from the pit?  It looked like he did... and hey, how about those hill tribes that were plaguing Rohann... they have to have taken up residence by now, what with the army scattered from one end of Middle Earth to the other... Things look rosy right now, but surely evil isn't ended so simply...  and what about Shelob?  etc. etc. etc."<br/><br/>So yeah, three hours is enough time to set up A, B, C, and D for a big E, but then, for me, when A, D, E, F, and G set up H, H has a good chance of being even better than E because E lends some of its strength to H... and then when B, D, E, H, I and J are rolled up into K, K is even bigger than H, and there isn't enough time in three hours to get all the way from A to H.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>By contrast, most trad games in my experience don't really think about campaign duration.  The assumption is that it is open-ended, potentially indefinite.  I think that misses a trick, I think if desired campaign length was taken into account it might lead to better gaming.  Desired campaign length might well be open ended, fair enough, but if so that has design implications.</blockquote>
Campaign length also has <em>financial</em> implications, which is why I'd say, Max, that most mainstream games are picking open-ended, indefinite campaigns very, very intentionally.  A campaign that goes on forever, has multiple facets that you can hop back and forth between, and a continual line of Bigger Bads behind the Big Bad comes very close to equating with continual sales of the core book and supplements.<br/><br/>The posterchild for this approach is, of course, <em>Exalted</em>.  Since nearly everything in the setting is a potentially playable character, they can sell splatbooks for both PCs and NPCs.  They have a ridiculously large setting, allowing endless location supplements.  Every organization has sub-organizations and factions, and it's a simple matter to create connections between them to increase setting complexity.  And when they start running out of stuff to print books about, they just need to introduce a new fatsplat and kick the ball to rolling again.  When that gets old, release a Second Edition and start over.  This is why I very commonly declare that <em>Exalted</em> is brilliant -- from a marketing standpoint.  However, I don't know how many decisions are made with an eye towards play of the game.                        </div>

                            Joshua,<br/><br/>Great post, I take your point.<br/><br/>Thing is, that makes sense financially, but from the sense of having a satisfying game I think not so much.<br/><br/>DnD, which in all honesty I should admit I don't like, is well designed for long term campaign play.  Exalted, not so much I think, because the growth in power and balancing that against challenges (and balance is important in that kind of game IMO) gets increasingly tricky while DnD helps you with that.<br/><br/>There is a tension between maximum game fun and maximum game profitability, they oft coincide but they are not coterminous.  One thing I like about the indie model, is folk make their profits by delivering a new fun thing, not by milking something until it stops being fun.<br/><br/>That's why I see Orpheus and Adventure! as better game designs in many ways than Exalted, they did what they set out to do and stopped.  You don't maximise fun by flogging a dead horse.                        </div>

                            On short and long games.<br/><br/>Firstly, that's too simplistic a divide.  Secondly, I think there are real benefits to an end goal, as in practice most open ended games tend to peter out in a rather unsatisfactory way.  The answer to getting a great long game is having a meangful long end goal with interim mini-goals, not to just playing until the group gets bored or breaks up.<br/><br/>Note, henceforth everything I'm talking is probabilities, there are no absolutes.<br/><br/>Short games are more likely to produce satisfying play focussed on a particular issue or small set of issues.  You get to grips with that thing, really have it out, play the hell out of it and you're done.  It's like the tv miniseries, long enough for a bit of development but short enough to tell a single coherent story.<br/><br/>One night games are like a movie, short and intense and you can only deal with so much by and large.  That said, what you do deal with you get real focus on, you have no time to lose so you use your time well.<br/><br/>Longer games have other satisfactions.  Depth is one, a character developed over extended play tends (remember, no absolutes here) to be deeper and more engaging by virtue of having been developed in play.  Of course, you can ignore that and play Bob the fighter for a decade and there are tools to help achieve similar results in more intense play, but length helps depth.<br/><br/>Longer play can also help get an epic feel.  Pendragon is great for this, you have adventures, your lands prosper or decline, you gain glory, marry and raise children.  In time they grow up and you play those children, who live in a world literally shaped by the players in the form of the parent characters.  That is depth, that is epic (a form of epic anyway), that is a tale that is hard to do (no absolutes) in a short and focussed game.<br/><br/>Note, I make no judgements here about which is better, I don't think that's actually a sensible question.<br/><br/>More in a mo, there are cakes down the hall and I have higher priorities when it comes to cakes or gaming posts.                        </div>

                            Longer games also need an equilibrium of sorts. You can't just escalate and escalate. This goes for both the narrative and for mechanics.<br/><br/>If you look at DnD, the power from level to level is largely an illusion, as you get more skillz, the enemies get tougher to match. Compare to Dogs, where PC abilities go get bigger and badder, or MLwM where PC abilities change over time.<br/><br/>Also, narratively if you spend too much time on any given issue, you'll burn though it too quick. This is evident just by looking at The Mountain Witch vs Dogs. In tMW, there's nothing except PC issues. TMW can't support a game much longer than what it already does, 'cause you burn through the characters.<br/><br/>I think many long term games tend to focus on external conflict first, and personal conflicts only peripherally. Options are much broader for external adversity than it is for internal/personal adversity. Personal issues only have so much play time. You can change personal issues over time, but then it just ends up being a string a little cycles rather than one "long" campaign. By focusing on external adversity, players can build personal issues slowly over time.                        </div>

<br/>I think that an important factor that Fred is talking about here is the creation of empathy. <br/><br/>If the situation had occured, as mentioned, in the first session of a game, Fred would not have had a strong emotional connection to his character or his character's lover. On the other hand, if that situation happens 10 or 20 sessions into a game, Fred has has time to build that strong emotional connection to his character and lover.  <i>That</i> is the power in the "powerful" statement above.                        </div>

                            I'm back, there were scones with jam and clotted cream.  <br/><br/>Mm, scones.<br/><br/>Anyway.  I think the rewards of longer games are as I said depth of character and a particular type of epic story is easier to do in that format.  Both these things can be achieved in shorter games, but longer ones are well suited to that.<br/><br/>Moving on, timefire makes an important point re DnD, and actually one of the many things I dislike about it.  There is no real progress, merely the illusion of progress.<br/><br/>So, what games do I think support longer term play well and what do they have in common?<br/><br/>Pendragon has a defined long term story arc, support for character growth and to see a full and rich character life ending in death and then renewal in the form of the son.  I think that is powerful stuff, incredibly clever and possibly the best long duration game design out there.  Play a full Pendragon campaign and you see characters grow from boyhood to men to old age, you see a full life lived at the table.  That is a special kind of thing, and while not for everyone that is hard to do in a shorter game.  <br/><br/>Bushido had a points build chargen mechanic.  Your first character had enough points to build an average guy of his class, an average warrior, an average priest, and so on.  When you died, your final honour score modified the points of your next character, so that if you died well your next character was built on more points.  Thus players were motivated to get into the medieval Japanese mindset of putting honour before life and were rewarded at the player level for doing so.  Actual character growth was capped, there were six levels and at sixth you were expected to retire and found a school or monastery or somesuch.  Again then, we have a structure for longer term but not open ended play, your guy has room to grow, to become a power, to retire and your next character if you played well will be better.  Clever stuff.<br/><br/>Last example, Traveller.  Classic Traveller that is, Little Black Book Traveller.  Traveller did have an advancement mechanic of sorts, but it was minimal and hard to advance with, most characters did not in fact chance in terms of stats and skills during play except downwards through aging.  In normal game terms, you didn't advance.  I think that helped longer term play by removing the power creep issue, in Traveller you lived a life, much as one does in the real world.  There was no character power to gain, except power within the game world in terms of wealth and influence.<br/><br/>So, what do these games have in common?  Each addresses the issue of power creep, Pendragon by killing you from old age and resetting, Bushido by forcing retirment at a certain point but rewarding you still for good play, Traveller by removing advancement.<br/><br/>And that's what makes IMO, or one thing that makes, for an effective game design aimed at longer term play.  You have to address power creep, and do it in a way that is satisfying.<br/><br/>For shorter games, other challenges present themselves, but I'll leave those to those better suited to addressing them.                        </div>

For you, perhaps, for me, not even close.  Lightning bug and lightning.<br/><br/>What I have found effective is starting at a, moving on to b, etc. and eventually getting together a group that clicks together and has nothing against committing to playing every other week for as long as we all live in the area, and it's still fun.                        </div>

Absolutely, but I am not making value judgements between shorter and longer games.<br/><br/>For me, (d) is easiest as I have a stable group.  For others, there will be other answers.  And even if (d) is easiest some will prefer (c) because for them it is more fun.<br/><br/>So I agree with everything you say, but what I'm arguing is that whatever duration you prefer designing with duration in mind will help and there are real and practical tools that apply to the various duration goals.<br/><br/>The indie crowd has given good thought to designing for shorter duration games, but I think that there are likely to be equally valid and powerful techniques for designing longer duration games.  Now, if longer duration games aren't your bag then that's not much of a muchness, tools to do something you don't find fun are only going to be of so much interest.  But if you do like longer duration games, and I personally do, then it becomes much more relevant as an issue.<br/><br/>And again, and this is worth repeating, there are no absolutes.  Longer games in my experience tend to support certain experiences better, shorter games tend to support certain other experiences better, both can do what the other does but each has its own valid rewards. There are no absolutes, but there are useful tools.                        </div>

Much snipped, but I thought I'd draw this out.  Both are true, (d) is less fun and (d) is more fun, but for different people.  The trick if you are in one group of people is not to get frustrated if you're playing with the other.<br/><br/>Also, and this is a bit of a tangent, for many people (d) is an unexamined holy grail that may or may not be more fun for them but which they assume is somehow intrinsically a better form of gaming.  Much as I enjoy (d), I think they're wrong and it isn't intrinsically better, but that meme is most widespread IMO.  Just not in the indie crowd.                        </div>

                            Makes sense.  More of Fun A, less of Fun B, and vice versa.  Decide which type of fun is more your bag and you'll learn which type of game will suit you better.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>The indie crowd has given good thought to designing for shorter duration games, but I think that there are likely to be equally valid and powerful techniques for designing longer duration games.</blockquote>
What about Burning Wheel?  I haven't ever played it, but it's designed for the long-term play, innit?<br/><br/>However, that one instance aside, I can't think of many others.<br/><br/>I am curious about the social framework necessary for these games, and how common it is.  These games cannot exist or prosper as products unless there is a market for them, and the market only exists insofar as people are capable of forming and maintaining these long-running groups.   It seems to me that one stupid-easy design trick to make these games more successful (in the social sense) is to build them so that the full group is not necessary each time -- a single player/character can be dropped for a session with no problem (extra points: the GM's presence isn't always necessary).  Sort of like long-running television shows where pricipal characters might not appear in an episode -- because they're having a baby or making a movie or whatever.                        </div>

                            Joshua,<br/><br/>You asked about <i>Burning Wheel</i> and long-term play.  Yeah, I'd say that it's a long-term play design, but I don't think that it's designed for duration in the way that Max is talking about.  I see (for instance) D&amp;D 3.5 as a long-term duration-designed game.  You hit level 20 and you're done.  That's how it was set up (though there are some ways to keep going).  <i>Burning Wheel</i>, on the other hand, is pretty much duration open-ended.  I've played five-session games <i>and</i> much longer ones without having to do any modifications to the rules.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I've had a lot of fun doing it!  I just don't feel like <i>Burning Wheel</i> does much to tell you when you're done.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            What I'm attempting in Errantry is to provide a mechanism whereby you can decide upfront what the (approximate) duration of your commitment is. The group picks a number of "boons" which you need to earn before you can complete your quest - essentially these are plot tokens. The smaller-scale structure of the game is episodic: you encounter a character and attempt to win a boon to progress your quest. Because there is considerable variety in the characters you encounter and several different ways of earning boons, I hope that this won't become tedious easily.<br/><br/>My main goal was to reflect the genre I'm drawing on (medieval romance), which is essentially a variable number of episodic encounters in which resources are gained to complete the quest. But I think it also works as a metering system for game length, and combines short-term and long-term fun.                        </div>

                            Thomas, that's absolutely correct. Burning Wheel doesn't have any story arc mechanics, or really any mechanics for narrative structure, period. The game assumes the players will supply the structural elements -- situation, complication, rising action, climax, etc. So it really is about open-ended play. The reward cycles are certainly geared toward long-term play, especially Trait votes and Reputation votes.<br/><br/>The thing is that we, as a group, do set up our campaigns and establish goals and so forth. Even Luke's 10-year campaign, which ended a couple years ago, was a series of 8-session or so story arcs, each of which was a complete story in itself. But none of that stuff is in the book.<br/><br/>All that stuff will likely go into the Adventure Burner, when Luke decides to set his hand to it.<br/><br/>We did include such mechanics in Burning Empires, which is designed to run in about 18 to 36 sessions for a full campaign (depending on whether you run two-maneuver or one-maneuver games); or six to 12 sessions for individual phases.<br/><br/>Other games designed for duration and constrained open-ended play include:<br/>* Nine Worlds<br/>* The Shadow of Yesterday<br/>* Conspiracy of Shadows<br/>* With Great Power (WGP is actually more satisfying over multiple issues than as a one shot, and one shots are great in WGP)<br/>* Primetime Adventures (assuming multiple seasons)<br/>* Sorcerer<br/>* HeroQuest                        </div>
