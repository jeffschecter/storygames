It would be a combination of a wish-list, writer's spec, and elevator pitch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have experience with this or have ideas, please share them!

They don't worry about marketing issues ("Who's the target audience?" "What are your plans for publishing?" etc.).  But they do make a game designer say "This is where I think the game design is going."  And having some sort of vision for a work helps guide the design... and makes it easier for others to give advice on achieving the project's goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332277/#Comment_332277" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T11:34:17+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 11:34AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did an 'unofficial' version for Tactical Command, should include it in the designer notes.

"what if ALL the ways that the world ends in different apocalypse settings happened at the same time, and the players were in the middle of it, and many of them are at fault for one part of it or another." (I pare it down from there for the elevator-speech version, but that was pretty much the starting thought.)<br/><br/>Then I developed a set of design principles that I wanted to work toward. I had a few mechanics ideas in mind, but I forced myself not to get too attached to any of them before developing the principles first.<br/><br/>To relate it to software development, I forced myself to write up functional requirements before I started on implementation.<br/><br/>I wanted everything in the design to be there for a really good reason. <br/><br/>And that included identifying who the audience was and what the game was about and why it was cool.<br/><br/>It's also part of why the game only ran a few times. Because one of my principles was that I wanted the game to be a supplement to the other games going on in the area, not a replacement. I was specifically planning to recruit players from other games, but I didn't want those players to run out of time and money to play the game I recruited them from. So I refused to schedule it at times when there were plenty of other games happening. And after I ran it a few times, some other games started up, and the schedule has been pretty dang packed ever since.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
