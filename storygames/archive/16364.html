The existence of this game and the other products connected to the World of Rynaga may be old news to some, but I just encountered them for the first time and I'm very taken by the art and design as well as the nature of the world-building project it all represents. I'm normally not an "Oooh, I must have this!" sort of person. This may be a time where I want to make an exception. Before I do though, I'd like to hear any impressions of the game or accounts of play from anyone that has them. Even just dark rumors mumbled by alleyway oracles will do if that's all you've got.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373822/#Comment_373822" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T09:46:34+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  9:46AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating.

As I checked out the cards and read about the world I couldn't help but draw some parallels to Talislanta. The setting and the character types express a very similar vibe for me. After reading the rules the game looks sound enough but play tells the real story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373838/#Comment_373838" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T11:26:57+00:00" title="April 20, 2012 11:26AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wasn't aware of the game until it was mentioned on penny-arcade.

This game is already in my head though. I'm thinking of ways to add arena or battleground cards that you would choose at random after drafting your team but before the battle begins. They would alter character abilities in various ways plus be a way to showcase different areas of the setting.<br/><br/>Let us know how it goes if you manage to get a match in!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373875/#Comment_373875" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T15:28:34+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  3:28PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2012 3:35PM by C_Edwards.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another hack idea, for rpg play. Create two more, non-combat, categories for character abilities. One would be a social interaction category. Create abilities for those categories. Whenever you're in a situation where you have to roll, you roll your two dice and can enact any ability that corresponds with one of those die results, just as with the standard version of the game. I imagine that many of the abilities would start to look similar to Moves in AW/DW/Monsterhearts/InsertHackofChoiceHere.<br/><br/>I think it might feel sort of like the choices you get in a computer game with a scripted story, where none of them usually quite fit what you want to do but can lead to interesting outcomes anyway.

The Version 5 rules have more options and complexity than earlier versions. So it's not just the expanding pool of cards with different abilities that is adding to the depth of the game, the rules themselves are being added to and evolving.<br/><br/>Since I just had a birthday I went ahead and got some Iconica as a present to myself. Got the little story book as well. Once it all arrives, and I have a chance to look everything over and give the card game some play, I'll report on my findings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374191/#Comment_374191" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T06:10:30+00:00" title="April 24, 2012  6:10AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please do!

I haven't had the energy or motivation to play Iconica or do more than take a cursory look at the game and other components I ordered. In addition I've had some computer components take a dump on me and I need to purchase some new ones. In order to help pay for the computer parts I'll be putting the Iconica stuff I have up on ebay sometime in the next week or two. But I thought I'd give first crack at it to anybody here that may be interested.<br/><br/>Here is what I have (w/links to the Iconica shop pages):<br/><br/><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/75325038/rynaga-travelers-collection" rel="nofollow">Rynaga Traveler's Collection</a><br/><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/74740581/rynaga-explorers-map" rel="nofollow">Rynaga Explorer's Map</a><br/><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/87265845/iconica-mini-series-one-expansion" rel="nofollow">Iconica Mini Series One Expansion (Cirqus of the Three Moons)</a><br/><br/>I'll be listing it on ebay as a single lot and would prefer to sell it that way. The retail value is $115+shipping but I'll probably be listing it on ebay with a buy-it-now of $80+shipping.<br/><br/>If you're interested just whisper me in this thread.
