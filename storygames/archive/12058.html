Now, I think "my god, how could they have told us that the game was about something that the mechanics didn't support".  In a way, indie games have "ruined" my enjoyment of story-focused traditional games.  I almost hate to do anything that isn't mechanically reinforced, now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269959/#Comment_269959" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T16:49:00+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  4:49PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2010 4:51PM by jenskot.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Dread (Jenga)</b> isn't on this list but it changed how I think about games.

They represent how much that things helps you accomplish what you set out to do (Vash the Stampede from Trigun and Inspector Gadget clarified this).<br/><br/>Nine Worlds: the system isn't really there to tell you if someone succeeds or fails.  It's there to prompt people into narrating things more creatively.  (In 9W, anything could be accomplished using any of the suits of cards, though you had to be creative in how to apply them to accomplish some things.)<br/><br/><br/>HERO system: mechanics and narrative description can be distinct from one another.  Powers and abilities can be described multiple ways.  Also: every superhero needs a variable power pool.  But actually doing complex power building and number crunching is an out-of-game exercise, not something to do in the middle of a fight.<br/><br/><br/>Everway: The mechanics of the game don't necessarily have to give you clear cut answers.  If the rules act like a Tarot card oracle, your mind tries very hard to find meaning in the randomness, which can make for a very satisfying experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270064/#Comment_270064" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T09:33:54+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  9:33AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a good list!

How much fun exploration of the game world can be. How a GM-prepped, GM-centric game makes exploration feel weighty and important. How much satisfaction can be gotten through exploration of system. How an "incoherent" game can accommodate divergent play agendas. How much fun it is to see a pseudo-simulation-engine produce unexpected results. How having a pseudo-simulation-engine can increase player buy-in of outcomes. A GM can have a strong hand in alleviating or exacerbating social conflict. World-building can be a fun solo activity.<br/><br/>Universalis - You don't need a GM. All content can be improvised ground-up by players. Mechanics can shape player activity through mechanical reward systems. Control over the SIS can be regulated like an economy. Rules can alleviate or exacerbate social conflict. The term "RPG" is probably best used as a "big-tent" term. World-building can be a fun group activity. Not all world-building needs to be done in advance. Exploration can still be a meaningful concept, even if the content is being made up on the fly. How meta-game currency can be used.<br/><br/>Theatre-Style LARP - Social interaction is a very interesting game mechanic. Putting player characters into a web of intersecting interests can be a powerful prime mover. A character doesn't need a detailed description; it can be sufficient to know what I am good at and what I am not good at. How to use "Bangs." Trying to railroad a large group of people without their consent is pure suckery. Props can make a huge difference. Exploration of character can be fun. A Social Contract can be constructed where players understand not to play "to win," but rather for the benefit of everyone's enjoyment.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age - The power of seed ideas thrown into a creative process. The social effect that a fixed setting/color has on the subsequent gaming. A brand-new powerful way of looking at the GM role. Say yes or roll. The power of aggressive scene framing, the power of a relationship map (I'd played Sorcerer, but didn't "get" this part yet). An excellent ruleset can be quite brittle when faced with a mode of play it wasn't designed to face.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270082/#Comment_270082" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T11:05:22+00:00" title="May  5, 2010 11:05AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried to put together my four, and then realized that who and when I played the game made almost as much difference as the game itself, in terms of importance. (System matters of course, but the overall importance of the game in my personal learning has a lot more factors.)<br/><br/>So, here's my four:<br/><br/>GURPS Reign of Steel with a great GM - Picked up a lot of the basic GM-ing skills from this game, and a lot of the stuff that wasn't in the book. Now that stuff's all in Apocalypse World (more or less), but at the time I learned a huge amount from that game.<br/><br/>Running My Life With Master with good friends - Probably my first real 'indie' game, more or less. Or at least the first one that perfectly clicked, mostly because it was played with my best friends. Made some concepts that might have been tough to get into play really click.<br/><br/>Warhammer 2E run as a story game - Again, something I learned a lot from how the GM used the rules. Harper knocked it out of the park, and there were lots of bits that I'm still trying to digest.<br/><br/>Playing Burning Wheel (and later running it) - Okay, so I guess this predates My Life With Master, but it was another revelation about how games can work, and how the focus can be placed and driven by the players. Again, the group made a huge difference, since they were people I was used to playing GURPs and 3E with, and we just kind of slid into a whole new kind of awesome with Burning Wheel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270092/#Comment_270092" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T11:47:37+00:00" title="May  5, 2010 11:47AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2010 11:51AM by Andy.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just note, for those chiming in with their four: John's list is "games that teach 'game design theory' through play", not "games that made you better; games that taught you how to play/GM".<br/><br/>So for example, my list of four would probably contain at least one or two games that I personally don't particularly like or enjoy playing, but are good examples of design anyway for some reason.<br/><br/>My "It teaches game design AND is fun to play, personally" list would probably look like<br/><br/>The Shadow of Yesterday<br/>Primetime Adventures or Dust Devils (yes, OR!)<br/>Shock: OR Polaris <br/>Breaking the Ice<br/><br/>EDIT: I should put Dogs in the Vineyard up in that list somewhere, but that would make 5.

Running one session of InSpectres changed all that for me, and taught me how to let go, react to what the players are doing and enjoy being surprised by what happens at the table as much as everyone else.<br/><br/><b>Primetime Adventures</b><br/><br/>I'd seen a few discussions online about scene framing, but I never really understood how to do it until running PtA.  I now feel a lot more confident in setting up a scene, starting it at an interesting point and cutting away before it drags on.  PtA also taught me how to picture games in cinematic or televisual terms, which now seems like an entirely natural thing to do.<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b><br/><br/>More than any other game (although The Mountain Witch comes close), Dogs taught me how to set interesting stakes in conflicts and not bother rolling dice for the unimportant stuff.  Not only is the conflict mechanic exciting, but it's involved enough that you don't want to go to it unless you have something really important to resolve.<br/><br/>The town creation rules in Dogs were also a revelation to me.  They taught me a lot about the kinds of things I need to prepare for a game -- NPCs with agendas, moral dilemmas and relationships between characters -- and to create problems without solutions.  Every game I've prepared since then has been informed by this.<br/><br/><b>Spirit of the Century</b><br/><br/>Until running SotC, I'd generally dreaded action scenes in games, as I'd grown too used to them being long, drawn-out and ultimately dull affairs.  SotC showed me how you could encourage players to narrate cool stuff during fights, and use some simple tactics, to make them as varied and engaging as any movie action scene.<br/><br/>Also, Aspects taught me an awful lot about reading flags on character sheets and using them to prepare or improvise a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270108/#Comment_270108" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T12:54:55+00:00" title="May  5, 2010 12:54PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Just note, for those chiming in with their four: John's list is "games that teach 'game design theory' through play", not "games that made you better; games that taught you how to play/GM".</blockquote>\nAw, man.

Shock: and Polaris do this too, and provide interesting responsibilities breakdowns in the process.  But Nodd highlights the creative interaction best for me, along with Super Action Now.  Alas, I still haven't played Universalis.<br/><br/><b>Sign in Stranger</b> showed me how it's possible to merge shifting stances and authorities with character play of the type I'd become accustomed to in traditional games.  PtA, Nodd, Shock:, Polaris, and SAN all feel very "telling a story from above" to me, while SiS gets me moments of feeling immersed in my character and looking out at the fiction from within.  Which brings me back to...<br/><br/><b>Call of Cthulhu</b>.  It's not the first game I played, but it's the most extreme example of my general RPG experience pre-indies.  Players method-act and poke fearfully at an uncompromising and hidden reality.  The GM runs that reality how he sees fit.  This is also how I played many other games, but in none of them was player/character ignorance as vital.<br/><br/>I have no games to list on the "make it about the characters" front, as my buddies and I figured that out on our own in the process of hacking many D&amp;D2- and GURPS-based homebrews to make them fun.  I figure anyone who played the above 4 games could probably do likewise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270743/#Comment_270743" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-11T19:03:14+00:00" title="May 11, 2010  7:03PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lessee.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard, for.

This is what I learned from what few indie games I've played:<br/><br/><b>Polaris</b> - following the rules can be very very important; GM-less/(ful?) gaming can really work; it's not just me: a good game can bring you to tears<br/><br/><b>Storming the Wizard's Tower</b> - Dungeons and Dragons was pointing at *this*; you can systematize investigation and inquiry fairly; combat can be both a common feature of play and yet simple and interesting; Gamism is not at all what I thought it was!<br/><br/><b>Penny for My Thoughts</b> - pushing the limits of how an RPG can work; extremely precise roles (to be negotiated/defined on the fly, too) about who does and says what, in play; a very soft and gentle version of "winning" is possible<br/><br/>As far as mainstream games are concerned, I would consider them (mostly) to be useful for having taught me the basic idea of what RPing is, and then there were some bad lessons here and there, some I reacted against (GM authority getting too heavy-handed) and some I had to unlearn to appreciate a lot of indie games (task resolution being the only way to do it, disdaining a close-read of rules, among other things). <br/><br/>Thanks, indie games in general! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
