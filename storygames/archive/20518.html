I have never felt that way, and neither have my friends. know that higher wages do not increase motivation for creative tasks - but i am not perceiving a game as a job nor as work. We are talking about people, playing games for multifaceted reasons. And some, i think a lot, like rewards. Luke Crane's reward focused design clearly works, and people enjoy playing the game</blockquote>\nLuke Crane is using a, to me, despicable and lazy game design where he exploits a glitch in the brain by using tangible rewards. It doesn't matter what kind of activity we're talking about, but tangible rewards does nothing for or can even decrease the intrinsic motivation for doing the task, unless the task is a) boring, b) physical, or c) a competition. It decreases because getting the reward will feel like an insult to some people, or having them focus more on getting the reward than enjoying doing the task in the first place.<br/><br/>Here are sources for that claim based on scientific research:<br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect#Controversy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect#Controversy</a><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_evaluation_theory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_evaluation_theory</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=u6XAPnuFjJc" rel="nofollow">Drive: The surprising truth about what motivates us </a><br/>Also, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi says the same thing in his book about Flow.<br/><br/>Bonus<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWtvrPTbQ_c&amp;t=10" rel="nofollow">Extra Credits - Skinner Box</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GArkyxP8-n0&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">Extra Credit - Humane Design - Games Must Be Good to Their Players</a><br/><br/>If you feel differently, that's just based on an opinion.

Or else, we could just design whatever boring game and give people money for playing it. <i>Make the interaction fun for those who wants to play it</i>, instead of relying on tangible rewards. Tangible rewards does perhaps does nothing for you, but <i>it will for other people</i>. Think of others beside yourself.\n<blockquote><b>3xJ:</b><br/>I said, <i>"It always feels nice when someone writes down part of your description."</i> Here, there is an external reward, being <i>"someone writes down some part of your description"</i>, a direct compliment, the reward also communicates mastery of "what is good at the table"  while elevating your description with purpose.</blockquote>\nThis is, however, a social reward not related to getting tokens for contributing, which I first responded on.

Are people just deluded, or does it depend somehow on the type of reward and how it relates to the game?</blockquote>\nThe two latter things.\n<blockquote>The "Forgist" line of thought here was something like this: what matters is the reward cycles of play. If some action is being rewarded with a form of currency, it should feed back into constructive play, to launch the next cycle.<br/><br/>(So, for example, gaining XP for your D&amp;D character allows you to take on the greater challenge you've been waiting for, and therefore leads to more adventure.)</blockquote>\nD&amp;D is to me a competition, at least in combat when describing reward cycles. You beat monsters (a competition) -&gt; you gain better stats -&gt; you beat bigger monsters. Game designers have then taken this reward thinking out of the cycle and playstyle. Someone likes what you're doing the game -&gt; give a fanmail. Even if that fanmail is creating a cycle, there is not real competition, just creativity.\n<blockquote>To take a more extreme example, in Monopoly you are rewarded for good play by earning $$$. I've never seen a player get "disincentivized" by this procedure and stop trying to get more money, because that's how you win the game.</blockquote>\nWinning = competition.\n<blockquote>So, how do you see this discrepancy? What's really happening, and how does the science meet the game theory?</blockquote>\nI'm going to answer why tangible rewards (XP, bonus dice, fanmail, etc) can decrease motivation for some people: I don't know myself by I have a theory. When doing a task you like, you have an intrinsic motivation for doing that task. If you're getting paid for it, the tangible reward might steal some of the attention away from the task and you start getting externally motivated for doing the task and, at the same moment, decreasing the internal motivation.<br/><br/>Another thing that comes into mind is a paper I read about motivation, and how it decreases when you focus on the end result of the task. If you instead plan how to achieve the task, the intrinsic motivation can increase.<br/><br/>In games, planning can be said to be doing the interaction towards the goal - playing the game; doing a task within the game - but a reward has nothing to do with the interaction but the end result, and starting to focus on the end result decreasing the intrinsic motivation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450839/#Comment_450839" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-23T13:54:02+00:00" title="January 23, 2016  1:54PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2016 2:18PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In my own experience, when something feels like it's not part of the game, it's a chore.

You push the button, you get a cookie. You open the box, you get a goodie. It should be obvious why this is a degenerate design.<br/><br/>On the intrinsic extreme, maybe a good model is the fantasy heartbreaker: an RPG that probably nobody will ever play (thus you don't receive the extrinsic reward of applause from your peers), which is only satisfying because you've done it. It's up to you to decide whether this is a good sort of reward.<br/><br/>I personally think it's very okay for a thing to be partially extrinsically rewarding. We do it all the time. Sure, you might do something for the love of the thing, but there's nothing wrong with adding an additional reinforcement to that, as well. In fact, one of the basic building blocks of teaching is positive reinforcement, which is a sort of extrinsic reward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450848/#Comment_450848" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-24T00:17:37+00:00" title="January 24, 2016 12:17AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2016 12:23AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if ineffective rewards stem from the <i>wrong relationship</i> between (a) the thing I already enjoy and want to do and (b) the formal recognition of that thing.  Tacking meaningless gold stars onto social interactions doesn't make them more fun, no matter how well the star awards are synchronized with valued actions.  On the other hand, "You've earned a shot of whiskey for that, buddy!" at a drinking party is extremely well-received.  <br/><br/>I think "more XP enables you to tackle the greater challenge you've been wanting" is pretty clearly in the positive direction.  The Experience Points themselves are just bookkeeping; the <i>real</i> reward is the ability to enter that cool new dungeon.  In a game where the fun includes entering cool new dungeons, there's nothing superfluous, artificial, or otherwise demotivating about this.  (Of course, if the way you <i>get</i> XP is by doing something other than the fun thing you want, then you could have a different sort of problem.)<br/><br/>Games are tricky, though, because sometimes effective play <i>is</i> the point and the fun -- learning and mastering systems, for example -- in which case formal measures of success really <i>are</i> the rewards of the activity.  (For me, personally, that's only in board games, never RPGs, but many Pathfinder/d20 fans will disagree.)<br/><br/>Or, well, that is, unless you want to distinguish between "reward" and "formalized positive feedback"...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450850/#Comment_450850" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-24T01:45:30+00:00" title="January 24, 2016  1:45AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2016 1:46AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thoughts from everyone!

If not, why isn't it?</blockquote>\nI honestly can't say. All I can say is that is a reward following a Variable Interval Schedule. I'm quoting from Chris Bateman's <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/08/designing_rewar.html" rel="nofollow">blog</a> when he's talking about B.F. Skinner's results:\n<ul>Assuming we have built a game with a core activity that the player enjoys, how do we keep them playing, and what makes them stop? It's all about the rewards the player experiences, and the manner in which those rewards are structured.<br/><br/>What sort of rewards can the player experience? Without attempting to define a taxonomy:\n<ul>Fixed Ratio Schedules: these provide rewards after a fixed number of actions. They produce a high level of activity and are easy to understand, but after the reward is achieved, there is a pause. XP in CRPGs is an example - although the gearing of XP systems is exponential, the intent is that the player is constantly moving up to tougher foes, thus keeping a constant ratio of kills to level. /.../<br/><br/>Variable Ratio Schedules: these provide rewards after a random number of actions - like a slot machine. You keep putting in coins, because at some point it will pay out. These also produce a high rate of activity and interest, but they tend to block exploration - as the player will stick with the reward schedule until it is exhausted, or until they burn out on it. Effective with all play styles - but burnout is always a risk. /.../<br/><br/>Fixed Interval Schedule: that is, a reward is provided after a set amount of time. This provides better control over the rate of reward, and comes with the same post-reward pause as a fixed ratio schedule. Indeed, pauses are inherent to fixed schedules of all kinds. An example is the new items in the shop each day in Animal Crossing - the player comes back on future days to see what's new.<br/><br/>Variable Interval Schedule: like the variable ratio schedule, this produces a steady rate of activity with no pauses - but its not as intense as the variable ratio schedule, because players quickly learn that their actions are independent of the reward. Good for encouraging a player to come back to certain places in a game, however, if a reward appears in certain places 'at random'.</ul>\nIn general, ratio schedules produce high rates of activity - "the more you do, the more you get". Variable schedules produce constant activity - "everything has a chance of reward". When these combine, (variable ratio schedule), the player will eventually burn out. Conversely, fixed schedules create a pause - which needn't be a negative matter.</ul>\nThe strong correlation with the last point to using a RND to succeed makes me question this design pattern a lot, because we shouldn't make our players dance like monkeys. I have nothing against randomness, like using random encounter tables, or other kinds of inspirational uses, but it's rarely questioned why dice even works in roleplaying games. What the psychological effect is from using dice.<br/><br/>But is the dice roll itself a <i>tangible</i> reward? Can the task itself be rendered unimportant compared to the dice roll?  Will the player do the task solely for the dice roll? Can it even be separated from the task itself? I would say ... no?<br/><br/>A good question. I will perhaps come back to this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450855/#Comment_450855" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-24T15:49:09+00:00" title="January 24, 2016  3:49PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2016 3:49PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In fact, one of the basic building blocks of teaching is positive reinforcement, which is a sort of extrinsic reward.</blockquote>\nDo note what I wrote about social extrinsic rewards in my OP.

I was trying to introduce some nuance that I didn't see in the earlier discussion, but obviously you've already parsed the relationships between feedback and intrinsic/extrinsic rewards.  I am surprised to hear you say this:\n<blockquote><blockquote>Games are tricky, though, because sometimes effective play <i>is</i> the point and the fun -- learning and mastering systems, for example -- in which case formal measures of success really <i>are</i> the rewards of the activity.</blockquote>\nWhich is an intrinsic reward given through a feedback loop.</blockquote>\nI has thought that you were using "extrinsic" or "tangible" in the same sense that I just used "formal" -- something the game system itself ascribes value to, awarding that value to the player at a specific time.  Perhaps not.  Perhaps you parse "you earn 10 victory points for that card combo!" as merely part of the intrinsic reward of combining the cards in my hand in a game-effective manner?  If so, then perhaps I've misunderstood your usage of "tangible" and "extrinsic" previously.  A 10-VP token is about as tangible as it gets, in my book.  And although "good job combining those cards!" is intrinsic, I don't know whether any specific way of tracking that achievement (cards, tokens, tally marks, memory) is best viewed as intrinsic or extrinsic.<br/><br/>Perhaps "tangible" is a complete red herring, and the key distinction here is this:<br/><b>Does the reward motivate you do something that your basic interest in the game doesn't already motivate you to do?</b>  If "no" then there's no problem.  If "yes" then that's the kind of dynamic you're arguing against.  In neither case does the particular form of the reward matter; in both cases, what matters is its power as an incentive, and its alignment (or lack thereof) with other present motivators.<br/><br/>Is that right?<br/><br/>If so, then that's what I meant by "right relationship"/"wrong relationship", and the next thing I'd like to talk about is alignment of motivations:<br/>1) our persistent motives as humans<br/>2) our general motives for the activity as per how it fits into our lives (socializing, stress relief, etc.)<br/>3) our motives for the game itself (winning, entertainment, showing off, etc.)<br/>4) the basic motives inherent in the game's framing (solve puzzles, combine cards strategically, etc.)<br/>5) the specific feedback of the system (formal rewards)<br/><br/>My suspicion is that, although a given example of (5) might seem misaligned with (1)/(2)/(3), it often achieves alignment through the mediation of (4).  That is, responding to gold stars, which may be dysfunctional in usual human endeavor, may be rendered functional in a voluntarily-entered artificial system (i.e. a "game") which defines the present activity in gold-stars terms, replacing the usual terms from everyday life.<br/><br/>Actually, hmm, this may be what I want to talk about regardless of whether I've parsed your terminology correctly.  I'm curious to see if you think it fits here.<br/><br/>Finally, I'll agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a> on the loaded language and risks of science-claiming.  Noting that Burning Wheel takes advantage of the way our brains function is great, and noting the downsides of tangible rewards is great, but calling it "lazy and despicable glitch exploitation" adds nothing to the discussion except negative emotion.  For me, anyway.  On the science end, I love the way you're using links to back up your arguments, but it's clear to me that the act of applying them to RPG play is one of interpretation, not proof or fact.  I would hope that no one here would claim otherwise -- it's not like Edward Deci has done a study on Burning Wheel.

It's certainly a strong hypothesis!<br/><br/>However, to say that is a clear deal seems like hyperbole. How confident can we be about the effects of the rewards generalizing to an activity like a roleplaying game? I haven't read these studies: for those of you who have, do any contain similar types of rewards?<br/><br/>The main thing I usually see missing from such studies (compared to games) as a feedback loop going back into the creative process of the game. Getting a cookie every time you score a basketball hoop does nothing to change the game of basketball, the process of playing it, or your ability to contribute to a basketball team. This is strikingly different from something like XP in D&amp;D, which feeds directly into various things we are all looking forward to in play. (And, yes, I agree that, like hit points, XPs are essentially a pacing mechanism. HPs tell us when it's ok to say the fight is over, and XPs tell us when we can move on to the next type of challenge - which we were probably looking forward to all along.)<br/><br/>The equivalent in a basketball context might be: the better you play, the better teammates you get to play with, and the better opponents you are matched up against (and, possibly, the more social reward you achieve for victory/success).<br/><br/>I wonder: does doing a certain thing competitively (e.g. playing basketball), meaning that your performance is attached to extrinsic rewards, diminish the inherent pleasure you take in that activity?<br/><br/>I don't know what the science suggests, but I would guess that it does. The sheer process is much more enjoyable when nothing is at stake. However, the virtues of competition, self-improvement, confidence, and facing challenge are enjoyable in and of themselves. So, perhaps the pleasure/interest is not being reduced but transformed? <br/><br/>If so, that's not necessarily a bad thing for game design, but would suggest that it's only relevant to certain play cultures (essentially, "those who take gaming very, very seriously", which actually sounds somewhat plausible to me).<br/><br/>However, all this makes me realize I'm not entirely sure I understand Rickard's claim/call to action:\n<blockquote><br/>Tangible rewards does perhaps does nothing for you, but <i>it will for other people</i>. Think of others beside yourself.<br/></blockquote>\nRickard, can you explain what you mean by this? What is the danger/threat at work here? In your view, are we harming people's enjoyment in playing games, or some other thing?<br/><br/>What is the evil you see and what does it look like outside the abstract? Can you relate an incident where someone was harmed or affected in this way you describe? I'd like to have a clearer picture of what that might be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450865/#Comment_450865" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T03:42:16+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  3:42AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another thought about game design goals: sometimes the momentary enjoyment of one player is not the most important thing to consider.<br/><br/>I have a game design in progress where supervillains pursue a variety of needy, neurotic goals.  Over the course of playtesting, I have found that mutual enjoyment benefits from everyone at the table seeing how each villain's need is driven by suffering.  If we see the villain lamenting his loneliness before he goes on his mission to seek adoration, then everyone else is better prepared to invest in what the villain player is doing.  More roleplayed suffering = more fun for the whole group.<br/><br/>The problem, though, is that in the regular flow of the game, there isn't always a convenient and natural time to show this suffering, and any given villain player may have their mind on other things.  I am still working on an ideal solution for this -- I have plenty of idea that just need to be tested -- but in the meantime, I decided to try simply giving villain players points for showing suffering.<br/><br/>So, what happened?  Well, the introduction of the reward was mostly irrelevant.  Mostly -- but not entirely.  Here's the breakdown:<br/>- some players who didn't show suffering before the points were added <i>still</i> didn't after the points were added<br/>- some of the players who were already showing suffering continued to do so but forgot about the points when they did so, only looking back once the time arrived to spend those points -- "Oh, hey, I have an extra one from suffering earlier, don't I?"<br/>- some of the players who were already showing suffering were happy to mark down a point after doing so; this did not affect their (or anyone else's) enjoyment of the experience in any perceptible way (suffering generally only comes up twice per player all game; it could be that "demotivation from points" could occur if there were more repetition?)<br/>- a very few players who didn't otherwise show suffering saw "oh, I get points for that!" on their character sheets or in other villains' scenes, and proceeded to show suffering themselves<br/><br/>This was a far from an ideal outcome, but I do think it was a net positive.  Most players' experience was not impacted (or perhaps <i>very</i> slightly negatively impacted by having a game feature to consider that they didn't actually care about), while a small number of other players found a new incentive to do a thing (show suffering) that made the game more fun for everyone, themselves included.<br/><br/>I think a lot of game design is like this.  As long as you're not trying to get people to do something harmful, or something they don't enjoy, then why not use whatever techniques are effective, "tricky" or otherwise?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450866/#Comment_450866" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T04:06:08+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  4:06AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2016 4:08AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I wonder: does doing a certain thing competitively (e.g. playing basketball), meaning that your performance is attached to extrinsic rewards, diminish the inherent pleasure you take in that activity?<br/><br/>I don't know what the science suggests, but I would guess that it does.

Playing basketball because you like running and passing and shooting, and playing basketball because you want to win the biggest games against the best opponents, both sound intrinsically rewarding to me.<br/><br/>The rewards of <i>training</i> are certainly extrinsic, though.  There definitely tends to be more extrinsically-motivated activity in the course of competitively ambitious play.  I don't think that diminishes the fun of play itself, but it does diminish the average fun of the overall pursuit.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450867/#Comment_450867" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T05:51:51+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  5:51AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>By "extrinsic rewards" I assumed you meant "for money".

Getting whatever-points in Burning Wheel certainly isn't more extrinsic than getting to trade a player from your team for a better player or some such?<br/><br/>So I decided that anything except "enjoying the process itself" was "extrinsic" in this context. Is that off-base? I don't know how else to engage with this topic.<br/><br/>I mean, I don't see people designing games where you get to have a <i>candy</i> every time you carry out an in-game action.

This is of course false - not because the science is false, but rather because you can't just decide arbitrarily that this or that complex phenomenon is the same thing as this seemingly different thing researched in a different discipline. I'll welcome a treatise written by a competent psychologist on how Burning Wheel (or some similar game) uses extrinsic rewards if somebody here wants to play the science game, of course.<br/><br/>The concept of "reward" in rpgs is commonly pretty muddled, and it doesn't help that Forgite theory uses the same term to mean something pretty different. Specifically, traditional rpg language uses "reward" to mean things that the GM distributes to the players as a technique of play that involves GM judgment, while Forgite theory uses the word for the satisfaction of creative needs. These are obviously different things, and sometimes things that are rewards in the common language are not rewards in the theoretical sense, or vice versa.<br/><br/>As an example, experience systems are often called reward systems and even handled as pavlovian reward machines by some GMs. This is not the ideal function for experience in most games, though. In old school D&amp;D, for example, the GM does not give you experience levels as a reward for being a good boy or something like that; the xp is merely an objective metrification of success that has already occurred. The xp is not even a reward in the theoretical sense, it's merely a symbol and acknowledgement of the real reward, which is the satisfaction of success in winning the challenge. The points are then further converted to experience level gain that basically glorifies and rewards the success by allowing you to play a more powerful and important character in bigger adventures later on; however, it is not the points that are the reward, it is the opportunity to play a bigger game thenceforth.<br/><br/>Similarly the experience system in a trad game - e.g. Vampire - is not intended to be an extrinsic reward; the xp is supposed to enable you to make changes to your character that make his story more tangible on the character sheet and bring him closer to what you want the character to be. It would be fair to argue that the "show up to play" xp reward common to these games <i>is</i> an extrinsic reward of sorts, but it's minor and ultimately just part of the general notion that the GM paces the campaign by deciding how much xp he doles out.<br/><br/>Finally, the various xp and hero point systems in Burning Wheel and similar games are not extrinsic <i>to the activity the game assumes as the core of play</i>: narrativist games use similar mechanisms where the players judge each other's play all the time, and it's almost always interesting because we want the players to talk to each other about the meaning or meaninglessness of their decisions. Burning Wheel, by making certain in-game resources dependent on player judgements of character behavior at regular intervals, regulates and defines a discussion space where this critical reflection occurs. This is not extrinsic at all to the game's narrativist goals.<br/><br/>I'll note that I can see how one could conclude that certain of Burning Wheel's systems are extrinsic if you're not in line with what the game is trying to do. For instance, my experience is that immersionist players of various stripes absolutely abhor these types of rules systems, largely because they seem to miss the point: you should play your character and act for them because that pure act is a value in itself, so having rules tell you what you must do and rewarding and punishing for behavior hampers and twists the game. Maybe this is why Rickard thinks that BW's mechanics provide extrinsic rewards?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450871/#Comment_450871" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T14:27:41+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  2:27PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2016 2:29PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm with David on the big picture here - Rickard is abusing the definition of "intrinsic" to claim that psychological science proves that types of game mechanics he doesn't like do not work, or are harmful.</blockquote>\nPlease don't try to put words in my mouth.

Intrinsic motivation is the self-desire to seek out new things and new challenges, to analyze one's capacity, to observe and to gain knowledge. It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual rather than relying on external pressures or a desire for reward. </blockquote>\n/.../\n<blockquote>Extrinsic motivation refers to the performance of an activity in order to attain a desired outcome and it is the opposite of intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual. In extrinsic motivation, the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually extrinsic motivation is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from intrinsic motivation. Common extrinsic motivations are rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives.</blockquote>\nIn <i>Theory of Fun</i>, Raph Koster writes that "fun is an emotional response to learning". In <i>Understanding Comics</i>, Scott McCloud talks about how curiosity is one factor of fighting boredom. Back to Theory of Fun, if you do something, and learn from the feedback, dopamine will be released in your brain. It's that substance that makes you feel comfortable for doing a task.<br/><br/>That's why I said that "Games are tricky, though, because sometimes effective play is the point and the fun -- learning and mastering systems, for example -- in which case formal measures of success really are the rewards of the activity." is an intrinsic reward given from a feedback loop.<br/><br/>Because a task becomes more and more enjoyable the more you go through this feedback loop, up until you learn the pattern of the response or master the activity, then the task will become boring, as shown in the flow diagram by Mih\xe1ly Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyii.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29#Conditions_for_flow" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Challenge_vs_skill.svg/300px-Challenge_vs_skill.svg.png"/></a><br/><br/>Here are three conditions for flow to happen.\n<ol><li>One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and progress. This adds direction and structure to the task.</li><li>The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. This helps the person negotiate any changing demands and allows them to adjust their performance to maintain the flow state.</li><li>One must have a good balance between the perceived challenges of the task at hand and their own perceived skills. One must have confidence in one's ability to complete the task at hand.</li></ol>\nAs you can see, feedback is important. So design for feedback loops. Design for an activity that gives immediate feedback that helps the user expand on the activity. All I'm saying is, avoid certain types of extrinsic rewards for non-competitive and non-physical tasks in roleplaying games, when you can rely on other types of feedback instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450875/#Comment_450875" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T15:20:17+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  3:20PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2016 4:04PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The rewards of <i>training</i> are certainly extrinsic, though.</blockquote>\nIt doesn't have to be. When I wanted to loose weight, I started to going on runs, swim, and taking daily walks. Training was in this case just a mean for some other goal I had in mind. When I met my goal, I stopped swimming and running, and instead just went on daily walks, mostly to sustain my weight.<br/><br/>The thing is, if I don't take my walk once a day, I feel like something is missing. I want to take a walk. I want to get out, see the nature, feel the fresh air, and everything that comes with taking a walk. So people can train for the pleasure of training, but I guess you were thinking of training for competition, and then you're right.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm going to the gym to build muscles but when I started, I didn't go four times a week. I started off slowly with two times a week, to build a pattern for myself so training at the gym would be something that would be a part of my life -  something I would enjoy doing.<br/><br/>This is almost a topic of its own - about how to like enjoying doing a task, and extrinsic rewards can actually be a push when the task is boring in the first place. Ask me in a couple months if I enjoy the gym. I don't, at the moment, not as much as I would like anyway (even if I enjoy the results). I did however train soccer for 21 years, and I didn't train for the matches - I trained because I liked to train. It was a huge part of my life.<br/><br/>[edit] I think you're talking about using extrinsic rewards to push players to start learning enjoying an initially boring task <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/450865/#Comment_450865" rel="nofollow">in this post</a>: "Here's another thought about game design goals: sometimes the momentary enjoyment of one player is not the most important thing to consider."<br/><br/>I kind of cheated earlier when saying "Have the right people playing the game, that enjoys the kind of interaction that the game is offering". (To me, the pitch is actually part of the game system.) It's a "No shit, Sherlock" thing for me to say because, of course, people would enjoy doing an activity they enjoy doing. Another way is to have an initial extrinsic reward as a motivator to learn the effect and enjoyment of an activity to push them in a certain direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450876/#Comment_450876" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T15:22:34+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  3:22PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2016 3:23PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/><br/>I don't know that the science even supports what he says. I'd be interested to hear from someone in the disciplines he's talking about explain it. Because what I see in those links is:<br/><br/>1) One talk from a business author, who references a couple of studies to make his point (science isn't about 1-2 studies, it is about getting the same results over many studies and building a scientific consensus on the matter). Maybe those studies have been repeated and there is overwhelming consensus. But from the links provided, I feel like I am being given a narrow glimpse into a much bigger debate. <br/><br/>2) One Theory in the field of Psychology  dealing with intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. And in that field, the word theory doesn't mean what is means in physics or geology, which I think is a very important distinction here since there is a big difference between the Theory of Evolution and cognitive evaluation theory. Questioning Cognitive Evaluation Theory and its application to table top roleplaying games simply isn't the same as say someone denying evolution (and Rickard is suggesting that people who disagree are essentially science deniers). Just a quick search on it, it looks like there have been studies that support this theory, but also studies that don't. And there are alternative theories as well. Personally, I have no real opinion one way or another because I am not a psychologist and this I've only ever encountered it online from gamers trying to argue against particular styles of play (and I can't help but sense this isn't exactly a problem the theory was intended to tackle in the first place). <br/><br/>3) A video from a youtube channel called Extra Credits, that tries to apply Operant Conditioning to video games like Bejeweled and online RPGs. The next video gets into the moral obligation of game designers. Just two observations: these are specifically about video games (which are a different medium than RPGS) and this youtube channel clearly has a point of view and is advocating a position that is more moral and political than scientific (it even puts the blame of failed relationship and bad physical health on game designers. These are just extra videos he added in, but they seem pretty biased toward a particular conclusion and they also don't match a lot of what I've been told by friends of mine who have done research into media and its affect on behavior. Again, I'm not a specialist, but neither is Rickard. I think we want to be very cautious about taking the equivalent of a TED Talk and building design theory around it. There seems to be a strange mix of sound science and business sales pitch going on the links. These videos may have a point about online video games. I am not sure since I don't play video games, but they don't strike me as a reliable scientific source. They strike me as opinion pieces by people who are passionate about video games and are trying to apply psychological theories to them. I'd be interested in videos by psychologists talking about game design. I am very wary of someone on a youtube channel with visible credentials using psychology to argue in favor of design they prefer. <br/><br/>My other issue, is I haven't seen Rickard try to put this into plain English. Instead I see him dumping psychological terminology and links, then saying "science" and expecting people to buy all of his assumptions. Dumping links isn't an argument and it isn't science. This seems like a really shaky way to talk about both science and game design. If there is useful science that he has found an application for in his design, I have no issue (and I'd love to hear examples of how he's made that science work). But I have problems with someone declaring some really common feature of a lot of games morally deplorable and bad design because they've somehow connected to them to some theories about motivation in psychology. <br/><br/>If he wants to argue that Bejeweled is boring and a waste of time, well I wouldn't disagree because I figured that out the first couple of times I tried to play those games. But I can't help but feel there is a kind of equivocation going on here because when I play tabletop RPGs that use reward systems, I don't find them boring or insulting (or manipulative) in the same way I might with an online game (particularly ones that are pay to play). Essentially all he really seems to be saying is the game itself ought to be fun to play, and it shouldn't rely on rewards to make it so. I don't think many would disagree with that, you certainly don't need links to psychological research to get people on board with that notion. But it just feels like he is using that to suggest games people are having legitimate fun with, are purely a product of them being manipulated by a reward system. <br/><br/>I am just very wary of the way the argument is being presents and how the line is being drawn from the social science to the games themselves. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450878/#Comment_450878" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T15:48:11+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  3:48PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2016 4:00PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I think I answered most of your post in my wall of text above, with the quote from Wikipedia. I hope it cleared some of the questions about the terms "intrinsic" and "extrinsic/tangible". I'm also using "motivation" and "reward" as the same meaning.\n<blockquote>Rickard, can you explain what you mean by this? What is the danger/threat at work here? In your view, are we harming people's enjoyment in playing games, or some other thing?<br/><br/>What is the evil you see and what does it look like outside the abstract? Can you relate an incident where someone was harmed or affected in this way you describe? I'd like to have a clearer picture of what that might be.</blockquote>\nWhen reading about the research made, and what engages us humans, I have started to question a lot of the activities in games, whether I do the task for the reward or for the actual task. A game like Rocket League is so fun to play that I come back to play the game. Sure, I unlock stuff but I don't care about that. What I care about is what's happening on the field. Compare this to all MMORPGs where it's mostly about grinding, instead of actual fun play.<br/><br/>When playing with fanmail, I noticed some behavior that has happened. First, if someone is not having enough fan mail, people would give it to that person as pity point. "Here, boy. At least you were trying".<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed was how <i><b>I</b></i> became annoyed when I got a point for doing a good description. I'm not doing the description for the point, I was doing to enhance the experience around the table, to have someone build on it, to show people how the game can be played. A point in this case was like a slap in my face. "Here is a treat for being a good puppy".<br/><br/>I also been in games, like with FATE, when people didn't build good stories - they just power gamed and ruined the experience because it was more important for them to get the points than actually contributing. A game like Once Upon a Time has either players playing to win or to build a good story together. You usually end up with a somewhat bad story and a somewhat bad competition. Sometimes, you end up with only storytellers and the story becomes great, and sometimes you end up with only competitive people where you play the game like Uno.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>As said before, I didn't notice this up until I actually did some reading about intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450879/#Comment_450879" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T15:58:48+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  3:58PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2016 3:59PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If so, then that's what I meant by "right relationship"/"wrong relationship", and the next thing I'd like to talk about is alignment of motivations:<br/>1) our persistent motives as humans<br/>2) our general motives for the activity as per how it fits into our lives (socializing, stress relief, etc.)<br/>3) our motives for the game itself (winning, entertainment, showing off, etc.)<br/>4) the basic motives inherent in the game's framing (solve puzzles, combine cards strategically, etc.)<br/>5) the specific feedback of the system (formal rewards)<br/><br/>My suspicion is that, although a given example of (5) might seem misaligned with (1)/(2)/(3), it often achieves alignment through the mediation of (4).

This is Rising's Principle of Gaminess (Risings spelighetsprincip) at work. It simply states "The best way of playing should also be the most fun". It's an incredibly powerful principle that has done a lot for my designs. Basically, if there's a way of winning the game, either explicitly (Once Upon a Time) or implicitly (that FATE game), then doing your best to win needs to lead to a fun game, otherwise your game is incongruous.<br/><br/>This is something I feel some games do badly. They give out points (an implicit signal of "winning") for things that, when pursued intensively, will break the game. That is, in my opinion, bad design. In those cases, it's better to leave out the points. OSR D&amp;D, though, where you get XP for gold, is not incongruous. If you intensively pursue gold, you're playing the game right! But if you're Opening your brain ten times a scene in AW (to get XP for rolling Weird), you're ruining the game, so that's an incongruous design.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Regarding motivation and psychology, I think there's one area where this research does apply, and that's campaigns that keep going even when they're not fun anymore. Here's what I think is happening:<br/><br/>There's this psychological phenomenon where you experience something and your brain doesn't know why you're experiencing it, and misinterprets the situation. For example, you're attacked by a man in a beard, and you develop a phobia of beards. Or you're on a date, order a decaf and get caffeinated coffee instead, and your brain interprets the shivers and increased heart rate as affection for your date (yes, this has been shown to happen). Or you are in a hazing ritual that's really humiliating, and you stay in it because of peer pressure, but you then think you must REALLY want to be in this group, because you're obviously prepared to endure a lot to be in it.<br/><br/>This phenomenon is, I think, widely studied and somewhat generalizable. And here's something we might want to be wary of as game designers. If you're doing something that's fun and you get a reward, your brain might think that you're actually doing it for the reward, and if you stop the reward, you'll likely find it less fun. So if you're playing D&amp;D and stop giving out XP, players might well tire even though they'd have enjoyed it without the XP if that was the deal from the beginning. And, since the XP never stop coming and you keep gaining levels, you might keep playing because you associate those XPs with the fun you had in the beginning, even if you're not really having as much fun anymore. So that might be a thing.<br/><br/>I think it's really hard to generalize, though, but I think it's an interesting thing to have in mind when discussing reward systems. But reward systems are so much more than just this. They're pacing mechanisms, they're thematic statements (you get better at magic by killing people), they're signals from the author as to what the game is about, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450882/#Comment_450882" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T17:17:14+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  5:17PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2016 5:40PM by WarriorMonk.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aren't we forgetting about the emotional component of the rewards? You see, there are many ways to give verbal/gestured* recognition to anyone and many different reasons to give it. There are so many that saying them all about a single action to a single player would probably take us the whole session. <br/><br/>And it would look/feel silly and forced.<br/><br/>Now, you know we all tend to attach emotions to certain things, like a color, a song, a belief, a phrase, a smell, etc. It's most probably because we had a pleasant experience which got engraved on our memory along with that trigger, and now every time we find the trigger in daily life, we remember that feeling and even relive it again.<br/><br/>Okey, now take a Token as a trigger (or a critical in a d20) and along the length of the game, or even along the whole life or the players, let them attach all kind of positive experiences to it. Next you know if that, people giving you a token means all kinds of recognition at once in an immediate way that doesn't feel nor forced nor silly. At this point it doesn't even matter if the ones who gave you that recognition meant something else, you get happy anyway.<br/><br/>The tangible reward has turned now into an emotional reward. Does this makes it a good game design? Nope, you can still attach negative emotions to it. Like relate it to a nonsensical breaking of immersion, relate it to game the system and see people game the system -furthering breaking immersion; works in the long term and an etc. much longer to the list of good reasons to use these kind of tangible symbolic rewards. At it's best it a gamble in terms of design, and by the amount of popular designs that use it (and thinking of how much of the players of those games actually use those mechanics), I'd say it's got a 25% of success.<br/><br/>Well, there's something I mentioned up there that kinda rises that margin of success to perhaps a 50% or more, but does it in the wrong way: pushing the mechanic like a button gives players who prefer to engage the system an opportunity to have their own fun while still complying (somewhat) with the roleplaying standards for the game. They aren't actually playing it right, the group will notice, and the GM may choose to not make the reward effective even though that would be against the rules. But often, if just because of this, the GM will just go with it and let them have their fun.<br/><br/>Also, I've got the hunch we're all probably biased on how good/bad rewards work based on the emotions we have attached to our game experience with them. Yet, please don't take it as "we're all being emotional thus none of our arguments have any sense", It's actually the opposite!<br/><br/>You see, negative emotions don't generate from nowhere, it's a way our brain has to tell us that something is going wrong here, based on our experience. The science presented is all right, but there is more science missing here, so everyone is having a controlled negative emotional response. Either we admit that and search for more science to find some agreement or take each other experience as a truth to build upon and get somewhere else.<br/><br/>Sorry I can't give you more science than my observations. Probably I read most of things I posted here somewhere else but for pete's sake can't say where, my memory for accurate data is terrible. Hope anybody has heard anything like this before and point me to the right source, thanks.<br/><br/>*like, an standing ovation for example<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/>Cross posted and missed Simon_Petterson post. He's got it right but you need to consider time, repetition and overlapping attached emotions to really make a less shaky defense of rewards. And yet as you can read in my post, it may not probably be enough for that. <br/><br/>Also consider most of people posting here have experience with story games instead of just playing trad and in fact, probably went for story games because they had a negative experience with the competitive/gamist part of trad games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450883/#Comment_450883" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T17:18:19+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  5:18PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2016 5:27PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>There's this psychological phenomenon where you experience something and your brain doesn't know why you're experiencing it, and misinterprets the situation.

It is entirely possible this specific issue with XP could occur but I think you would actually need a number of large studies involving table top RPGs and this system of reward. I don't think you can generalize that broadly here, because XP isn't just a reward, it is also a reflection of your character's advancement based on what they do in the game world. XP also isn't an immediate thing. I don't get XP each time I perform an action. I get XP at the end of a session, after hours of playing. For what you say to be true, I'd have to confuse three to five hours of boredom with the small spark of joy I get in the last two minutes of the evening when I get my XP (and XP sometimes isn't even handed out until the next session). That might motivate me to continue playing if I really like XP (just like my paycheck might motivate me to stay in a crummy job). But I am not confusing the pleasure of getting the reward at the end with the XP or Paycheck themselves. <br/><br/>I think something like that might only apply if it were much more powerful and immediate (like a GM giving players a cup of coffee or chocolate every hour or something---where you might actually start to blur the pleasure of playing with the pleasure of those experiences). But at the end of the day, if the person enjoys drinking the coffee and that is what brings them to the table and they have a good time...would that even be such a terrible thing. I know I've participated in activities where something like that has been the case, I've even become aware of it, and it didn't trouble me. <br/><br/>A much more plausible scenario is people just keep playing a campaign they don't like because they enjoy the company of the group they are part of and associate that experience with the game. But that isn't really a design issue. And i think for the most part, that isn't something the designer has an obligation to fix for people. This seems a lot like people are playing psychologist and trying to use games to fix them or something. <br/><br/>I do think there is value in psychology and science, but I also think we have to be honest with ourselves and understand our own limits. If you are not a professional in those fields, I think you are going to have trouble really integrating them into something like game design. You can try. And I certainly encourage people to experiment with ideas if they produce something useful. But once folks start doing that to disparage a play style or manipulate folks into agreeing with a point of view about fun and gaming (because they have science!), I think it really poisons the well. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450885/#Comment_450885" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T17:37:27+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  5:37PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know Rickard, we've read up on this research, too. I've personally talked and written against psychologically exploitative design in video games since whenever (2007 or so maybe, for those keeping track). It is not necessarily a position of ignorance if somebody disagrees with you about what is and isn't an extrinsic reward, and I at least won't be convinced about any actually applicable point of discourse with a bunch of concepts from psychology and an arbitrary claim that they apply to this or that in game design - you need to show it, not merely claim it, when making extraordinary claims.<br/><br/>Or, alternatively, I'm too stupid to understand you. That's a possibility as well.\n<blockquote>Paul, I think I answered most of your post in my wall of text above, with the quote from Wikipedia. I hope it cleared some of the questions about the terms "intrinsic" and "extrinsic/tangible". I'm also using "motivation" and "reward" as the same meaning.</blockquote>\nRight, so your claim basically seems to be that certain structural game systems are extrinsic motivators because you say so.<br/><br/>To further clarify the issue, I pick out a few practical examples that I understand you think are external, tangible motivators of activity from real games:<br/><b>*</b> The array of hero point variants used in Burning Wheel.<br/><b>*</b> Likewise in FATE.<br/><b>*</b> Fan mail in Primetime Adventures.<br/><br/>My suggestion is that none of the above are extrinsic motivators in the psychological sense; they perform several actually real functions because they are effective game design by experienced designers, but being an extrinsic motivator is not an intended or primary reason for their existence. Being formal language constructs that facilitate communication is a more important role for these things, for example, and one that I've witnessed again and again in games where no extrinsic worth whatsoever has been ascribed - people use fan mail as an alternate and quantified way to show appreciation, for example, in addition to or instead of speaking. Am I erroneously not seeing the extrinsic reward, or are you ascribing one to games that do not intend such?<br/><br/>Furthermore, I'd like to note that even if we can point to extrinsic rewards designed into certain games, this alone is not sufficient to show that extrinsic rewards per se are bad. I've certainly spoken out against manipulative, exploitative game design at times, but my reason has never been baldly to claim that all worthwhile activities are necessarily intrinsically motivated; I rather suspect that we could point to all sorts of applicable gaming cases where extrinsic rewards are the appropriate tool that leads to worthwhile goals. It is good to be aware of these concepts and the apparent psychology involved in them, but in practice it's not nearly as simple as "intrinsic = good and extrinsic = bad". (What <i>is</i> bad in my thinking is instrumentalization of your player base - treating them as tools of your business and striving to create games that injure people in your own pecuniary interest instead of elevating humanity with your art. Plenty of reason to dislike certain strands of video game design for reasons that merely brush upon extrinsic vs. intrinsic reward systems.)<br/><br/>This openness to extrinsic rewards is important for game design - and I would argue, specifically for roleplaying game design - because of how complex these games are, and how the players go through engagement in multiple different tasks and core play activities during play. Analyzing Bejeveled as a singular game experience is all well and good, but doing the same to a complex roleplaying game may end up failing due to the greater psychological complexity of the game and its multiple core activities.<br/><br/>For example, purely for the sake of creative speculation: could it be possible that certain tasks in roleplaying games are not intrinsically rewarding, but they are nevertheless necessary, and therefore extrinsically rewarded by other parts of play? It occurs to me that while there is such as thing as intrinsic satisfaction at map-making, nevertheless the primary reward one gains for mapping in D&amp;D comes in the form of increased clarity in another part of play - namely, strategy and logistics being easier with a clear map. One could choose to characterize this as one part of play being extrinsically rewarded by increased ease and competence in a different part of play; this could even cause the intrinsic pleasure of map-crafting to decrease because you are focused on the extrinsic reward and not on the activity itself. Despite this, I suspect that few people would condemn the map-making in D&amp;D as bad game design simply because it is not an activity for its own sake, but rather something done in support of other parts of play.\n<blockquote>When playing with fanmail, I noticed some behavior that has happened. First, if someone is not having enough fan mail, people would give it to that person as pity point. "Here, boy. At least you were trying".<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed was how <i><b>I</b></i> became annoyed when I got a point for doing a good description. I'm not doing the description for the point, I was doing to enhance the experience around the table, to have someone build on it, to show people how the game can be played. A point in this case was like a slap in my face. "Here is a treat for being a good puppy".<br/><br/>I also been in games, like with FATE, when people didn't build good stories - they just power gamed and ruined the experience because it was more important for them to get the points than actually contributing. A game like Once Upon a Time has either players playing to win or to build a good story together. You usually end up with a somewhat bad story and a somewhat bad competition. Sometimes, you end up with only storytellers and the story becomes great, and sometimes you end up with only competitive people where you play the game like Uno.<br/></blockquote>\nThese are familiar situations to me as well. For instance, players do indeed sometimes feel the need to give somebody fan mail in Primetime Adventures as a social palliative, so as to soften the sting of rejection. I do not encourage it, but I do encourage subjective reward thresholds: I try to make sure everybody gets fan mail when they try and accomplish on their own level, wherever that level is. All this of course has nothing to do with the reward being extrinsic, unless maybe you think that the mutual appreciation of our collective creativity in story-making games is an extrinsic motivation. Used properly, fan mail per se is nothing except a mechanized expression of appreciation. (The fact that the points can later be used for stuff is not intended as a <i>reward</i>, it is a thematic statement about the nature of tv drama.)<br/><br/>Aside from that, it seems to me that what you have here is some attitude issues (you refusing to interpret the fan mail in PTA as a sign of earnest appreciation is a choice, and specifically a choice that others have chosen not to take many times in the past) and some bad play (all games like FATE where you can get points by doing stuff will break if the group does not maintain genuine standards; you need to only get the points for the legit shit, not the bullshit, so to speak). I am not satisfied that these phenomena are caused by said mechanisms being extrinsic rewards; they are explained just as well by attitude and technical mistakes in applying the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450886/#Comment_450886" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T18:08:02+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  6:08PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll make a separate constructive post, too, because this is a topic that merits some more writing than just trying to explain to Rickard why I am not convinced by his claims.<br/><br/>As I've hinted earlier, I think that it is necessary to be careful about what you describe as a reward extrinsic to the activity itself - you need to understand the activity to make the judgement, for instance, which may be non-trivial. I do think, though, that the actual phenomenon of ineffective extrinsic rewards - and even lazy game design using such - is probably real, even if I disagree with Rickard about every one of his examples so far.<br/><br/>As I think I mentioned earlier, I think that difficulty in determining what's "bad design" in this way goes back to understanding the actual instance of play. The same game can provide extrinsic or intrinsic rewards in different instances, for example, if it is being utilized for different purposes.<br/><br/>To illustrate this important point about how subjective our judgements can be, a practical example: in <i>Ars Magica</i> it is possible for your characters to gain experience points and thus increase their skills in a variety of ways. One of those ways is adventuring, and adventuring is in fact a trade-off in some ways, because the character could as well spend their time reading a book at home, accumulating xp that way.<br/><br/>I would argue that the experience points you get for adventuring are an extrinsic reward from the perspective of the adventure, and the ethos of adventuring for the sake of adventuring; they are a bribe the system uses to somewhat balance the choice and thus make it easier for characters to commit to adventuring when provided a passably promising adventuring hook. Everything Rickard says about the problems of extrinsic rewards potentially applies: a player may adventure for the wrong reasons, poisoning the experience, or they may lose their interest in the contents of the adventure when given the choice of cutting the adventure short to go directly to scoring the "prize" in the form of the xp reward.<br/><br/>However, from the perspective of a long campaign those experience points are very much not an extrinsic issue: you could put them into a rare skill that cannot be trained by books or tutors (the Adamic language from one of the core supplements of the current edition comes to mind), for example, and thus the points could contribute to the character's long-term goals. The fact that the character learned some important insight while travelling abroad becomes a tidbit of detail for the campaign lore - treasured color for the game. It is an intrinsic feature of the game for characters to accumulate lore and learning from a variety of sources, and in this way it very much <b>is</b> an intrinsic matter whether your character gets this or that skill to level 10 during the campaign or not. In fact, Ars Magica the game would disappear almost entirely were it not for the pacing and regulation that raising skills provides: almost everything in the game is about characters accumulating experience points to become proficient enough to move on with their plans.<br/><br/>As we can see, even a single game can be at cross-purposes with itself about the intrinsic nature of its elements - about whether they are rewards at all, in fact. Whether the adventuring xp in Ars Magica is <i>a good idea</i> (this is what it boils down to, here) depends on how the group construes their campaign and what their attitudes to the various stages of play are, and so on. It is impossible to say in general whether that rule is a good one; the best we can say is that when utilized in the spirit it is intended, it is a logical and valuable part of the game.<br/><br/>So OK, we've hopefully established that this is a subjective issue that needs to be considered in the creative context of the play instance, not as an abstract mechanical question. This goes for all sorts of games, including <i>Once Upon a Time</i>, on which I actually agree with Rickard somewhat - it is at horrible, horrible cross-purposes with itself due to how the game encourages you to both win and tell a story in style, simultaneously. Yet even there we know that there are groups for whom OUaT works fine and well, with no problems whatsoever. (We also know why this is the case, incidentally: the group either has a strong creative commitment to a style threshold - such as a single player who has enough social capital to demand that the others uphold the standard - or the group only uses the victory condition as a pacing device to end the game rather than the player actively competing for it.)<br/><br/>I think that all this comes back to an old Forgite saw-horse, namely the notion of cohesive game design rooted in clarity of the creative agenda. We cannot even say whether a given rule is an extrinsic reward system without choosing what the creative purpose of play is supposed to be, but what we <i>can</i> do is to attempt to create games that service our chosen creative purpose well. A well-designed game being played in the same spirit it was intended by its creator won't have the lazy design Rickard abhors (and which I, too, abhor, although we seem to have rather different notions of what constitutes lazy design if he thinks that Burning Wheel passes for it) because the designer is not in fact bribing the players to do what he wants - he's giving the players tools to execute what he, the designer, feels is a worthwhile endeavour.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there are lazy games out there, a multitude of them. I think that extrinsic rewarding is very, very common in trad adventure games, for example: every game from MERP to Exalted and beyond runs off the idea that the GM can reward and punish the players with combat competence (xp to level up and purchase powers) to keep them in line and properly appreciative of their storytelling; you play along with the storytelling or you don't get the xp rewards to make your character a badder mofo. <i>This</i> is true lazy, schizoid extrinsic reward bribery game design, and it does exist. (Although, in all honesty, I have to say that many of the games doing this stuff are just copying others or being timid about innovation and whatnot - I'm not suggesting that all these designers actively think about their game working in terms of bribery. Besides, if the group is actually on board with the GM's plans, there is no bribery because they're doing it anyway, right? It's all subjective.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450890/#Comment_450890" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T18:29:45+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  6:29PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Meanwhile, there are lazy games out there, a multitude of them.

Because I have to say, if any system that rewards players with greater competency through leveling up and/or skill point spending, I think the elephant in the room is the level of popularity these games enjoy. You could dismiss that, and I see people do it all the time, but the fact remains it is incredibly common and a lot of players appear to enjoy that reward system (I've seen this first hand because I've experimented a lot with different approaches to XP and to the notion of levels in games, and I find those reward systems get a positive reaction from most players. Now some don' want that, and there are usually alternative methods for handling groups where a different preference is in play. But the whole: get XP, level and get new cool abilities, seems to be pretty tried and true. <br/><br/>Now one could say that is lazy design I suppose. But I see I see the word "lazy" being thrown around a lot lately and have grown somewhat suspicious of it. In both game design and writing conversations.I've come to believe it gets used because no one wants to be considered lazy and it is an easy way to win a debate online. I don't know, maybe it is lazy design, but it also seems to be pretty effective given how popular it is. That doesn't mean other approaches shouldn't be tried. I just think when you write off a whole approach as "lazy", that itself is a bit of a lazy point to make. It is almost reflexive online (x is just lazy writing, this is lazy design, etc). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450892/#Comment_450892" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T19:17:30+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  7:17PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2016 7:21PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the D&amp;D xp rewards are only futile for campaigns where the function those rewards serve is futile. How common those campaign are, especially today, is a difficult question to answer.<br/><br/>Where xp rewards in D&amp;D are meaningless is when the group is actually using D&amp;D as a narrative platform. Today it is not uncommon at all for GMs to remove the xp rules and simply dole out experience levels as necessary as the story progresses - this is, obviously, just a short-cut that removes the earlier 2nd edition "quest xp" tradition from play without harming anything. Instead of giving out X points of xp to get the characters to the appropriate level for the next adventure, you just set their level appropriately before moving on. Much simpler and more elegant.<br/><br/>Where xp rewards are <i>not</i> vapid bribery is when xp tables between classes differ; when characters achieve different amounts of xp; when characters can die and thus "lose their progress"; when the xp gain depends on concrete results achieved in play. It is no coincidence that these same things tend to be hallmarks of old school D&amp;D, from whence this entire xp scheme comes from.<br/><br/>But yes, it seems to me that it's eminently possible for the D&amp;D xp scheme to be used in the exact way I described, as a cudgel the GM tries to use to drive interest towards his story arc. There are textual rules for this, and plenty of GMing techniques. When the players are interested in challenge-oriented adventuring, including hack'n slash, and their effectiveness therein is constrained by xp, and the GM doles out xp on the basis of story participation - if this is not extrinsic reinforcement, then I do not know the meaning of the word.<br/><br/>But that's not somehow solely D&amp;D's fault - my main point up there was that as we should know by now, game texts actuate in the context of an actual group trying to do something with the text. If you use D&amp;D's xp as an extrinsic bribe, then that's what it is, and if you don't, then it isn't. It's as simple as that, I think, except that in some games it is easier or harder to make the mistake.<br/><br/>As for whether it is lazy in D&amp;D - it wasn't lazy originally, and it wasn't extrinsic either, because there's nothing extrinsic about the original D&amp;D's level-up scheme; it was there for you to earn the right to greater adventures by proving yourself in lesser ones. In newer D&amp;D, perhaps it is lazy, or cowardly? I could argue that it is such in 4th edition, for example - a real man would've removed the experience points scheme from that particular design. (Of course corporations are not men, so that's no slight towards what the WotC designers were doing; I imagine that they decided to retain that element to make the game seem more similar to older editions than it really is.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450893/#Comment_450893" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T21:08:00+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  9:08PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My wall of text above got lost among the last wall of texts.

Maybe you could summarize your point, or provide an example?)<br/><br/>As far as the thread topic in general:<br/><br/>I must say that, despite the overly strong language of the initial post (and the waving about of "Science!" as an arguing-stick), this is a fascinating and fruitful discussion.<br/><br/>I think this is an excellent call to action:<br/><br/>1. Extrinsic rewards are often not, in themselves, motivating. When you use a reward scheme, give it some serious thought, and make sure it ties into the game you're designing.<br/><br/>2. Remember that good game design is about making things fun/enjoyable/challenging for the players. This should be your priority; slapping reward mechanics on something doesn't make it fun.<br/><br/>When it comes to complaining about game design being lazy, evil, thoughtless, and manipulative, I don't (yet - I'll endeavour to keep an open mind!) see how this kind of design deserves to be saddled with that kind of moral behaviour.<br/><br/>From the examples being given so far, I don't see any cases of players being harmed or hurt or abused by this kind of design. (As arguably certain forms on online games, gambling, and so forth, do - they take advantage of poor/foolish/susceptible people and condition them to engage in an activity which is harmful to them and a negative influence in their lives.) I can just barely *imagine* that kind of situation for someone playing a game like an RPG - a la Jack Chick! - but I cannot imagine that coming about because the game includes some Plus One Points. <br/><br/>Rickard, your examples of rewards leading to poor play are good ones. (I'm also particularly not fond of Fan Mail and similar awards.) But I fail to see how they are harmful or bad or some other strong term. Wouldn't it be enough to say, "I don't know enjoy game design which uses these features, though others may"?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450895/#Comment_450895" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T23:13:45+00:00" title="January 25, 2016 11:13PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, resumed version: <br/><br/>Rickard's "Science!" argument was ok but missed a crucial point (and some less strong language would have done better there, but I get why he used it.<br/><br/>Why it was ok? I'll get to that later, first I need to explain (better) what he missed. What it's been missing since the start of the thread. Simon_Pettersson got it partially right, tough.<br/><br/>It's this process:<br/><br/>1) players learn to (properly) use a system that employs tokens as a reward. Let's say they are meant as a reward for roleplaying their character/developing it through the game. Up to the first few times they use it, it may not feel as a real reward nor incentive. <br/>2) After a few repetitions, specially successful ones, the token gets charged as a <i>symbol</i>. Players will attach all sort of positive emotions to it, like how<i> it felt</i> when X player did Y or Z happened. Note: they won't particularly remember what happened, but <b>how they felt</b> and the token will trigger those feelings.<br/><br/>But getting to 2 it's somewhat difficult; If the way the reward is applied turns out to break immersion or it's used improperly by anyone at the table, like by gaming the system or focusing on the reward instead of the behavior being rewarded, the mechanic backfires. And it backfires so badly that people drop the mechanic or even the game. Add the rest of the "Science!" argument here, and if you can find some extra science to support what I wrote above (I'm sure there is but I'm too lazy to find it) now Rickard's argument is a bit more solid.<br/><br/>So making a design that uses any kind of game currency as a reward besides of a pacing mechanism, has a quite high chance of backfiring. Perhaps more if played by a group who favors a mechanic (gamist if you want) approach to the game instead of an acting or story approach to it. <br/><br/>Does this chance makes it bad design? Kiiiinda. That's really stretching it. The lazy part is perhaps not telling players how to prevent it from backfiring, by giving players better techniques to apply the mechanic without breaking the immersion. For example, giving the reward quietly without making any fuzz from it, or doing it in a break after a scene has ended.<br/><br/>By the way, for those who use rewards, exactly how do you hand them out? And those who used them once and hated them, exactly what did the other players said/did/gestured that made you feel that they were giving you the reward for pity or made you feel like being, I dunno, patronized or anything over something you usually do? What about, when you do the things that these games reward, in games that don't, why do you do them? How do you expect other players/the GM to react to your input? What could be considered a good and a bad reaction then?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450896/#Comment_450896" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-26T01:25:28+00:00" title="January 26, 2016  1:25AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2016 1:27AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard, thanks for the Wikipedia quotes, the flow diagram, and the explanations in that post.  I have never been sure whether to parse Koster's theory as "fun" or just a specific subset of fun -- it describes my most avid boardgamer friend <i>perfectly</i>, but I dunno about RPGs or performance for audience, both of which I also consider "fun".  Maybe the object of learning and mastery in those cases is interpersonal, and it never "ends and becomes boring" because we never "master other people"?  I don't know.  I'm going to have to think longer and harder about that post of yours before I can form an intelligent reply.<br/><br/>In the meantime, in the interests of keeping up with some topics in motion, some more thoughts:\n<blockquote>This is actually what this topic would end up in, and it deserves another thread.</blockquote>Sounds good!  Thank you for the links.  I am a slow reader; I would like to say I'll get to them soon, but I'm not sure.  I will say that <i>hopefully</i> I'll get to them soon.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>So people can train for the pleasure of training, but I guess you were thinking of training for competition, and then you're right.<br/>. . . <br/>This is almost a topic of its own - about how to like enjoying doing a task, and extrinsic rewards can actually be a push when the task is boring in the first place.</blockquote>Yes!  This is exactly what I had in mind.  I'm not sure whether it's best addressed here or in a new thread, but let me share one anecdote about my experience with Burning Wheel that's highly relevant:<br/><br/>When I first played a Luke game for real, it was Burning Empires with Matt and Rich (and others, but not relevant to this story).  Matt already knew the system and loved it.  Rich and I had never played anything much like it.  For the first few sessions, Rich and I tried thinking solely from the fiction and character POV, and completely failed to effectively incorporate the mechanics.  Matt, on the other hand, met a lot more of his objectives, and clearly relished his rules mastery, providing a good example of how Rich and I might <i>learn</i> to play the game.  At first I assumed that Matt must be doing a lot of the sort of rules-first metagaming that I generally dislike when I'm playing a single character in an RPG, but Matt described his process to me and I actually found it pretty accessible.  By perhaps the 4th session of play, I was firmly on the fun learning escalator to getting better at Burning Empires.  Rich, on the other hand, tried to wrap his head around the unfamiliar style during play, found it difficult, largely gave up and tried to do what he was used to, and spent a lot of time frustrated.<br/><br/>Matt's ability to get stuff done for his character was what motivated me to care about emulating him, and the <i>way</i> he got stuff done was by utilizing the sorts of game features I hadn't otherwise cared about, e.g. the formal point rewards.  I started writing Beliefs I could complete in a session because now I wanted those Artha points that'd help me succeed at stuff!  And, hey, what do you know, Burning Empires is also <i>more fun</i> (in terms of narrative pacing and vs-GM competition, anyway) if you complete a Belief every session!<br/><br/>So, maybe this is extrinsic rewards becoming intrinsic?  Maybe this is like me willing myself to find the fun in training?  Is Rich at fault for his failure to get it, or am I extra special for not suffering his fate, or is fault and skill not an issue at all and it's really just a matter of taste?  Is the game design to be commended for making me learn a new play style, or to be criticized for failing Rich?  Both?  Neither?  In lieu of any semblance of an objective conclusion (so far, anyway!), I'll just say that I think it's a neat game and I'm glad I played it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450897/#Comment_450897" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-26T01:34:43+00:00" title="January 26, 2016  1:34AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>2.

My point (which was my attempt to get at Rickard's point...) was that designer should be very aware of what the experience of play is like, and design towards making it enjoyable/engaging/frustrating (or whatever aims), rather than blindly slapping on rewards (or, presumably, punishments, though we haven't discussed those) and assuming that makes an activity desirable or undesirable. <br/><br/>In other words, if you want players to do something a lot out of intrinsic motivation, the first step should probably be to make that at some level they enjoy doing that thing.<br/><br/>(If you still disagree, let's take it to private conversation!)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450900/#Comment_450900" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-26T03:26:48+00:00" title="January 26, 2016  3:26AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2016 3:28AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just saying there are folks who say, "Design an artificial interactive system first and <i>then</i> see if anyone enjoys it."

Because what you are talking about is mistaking that bit of pleasure you get when the reward is given, with the act that lead to the reward. If I am spending hours playing a game, how am I going to blur that line if the reward comes after the session? If I was bored those several hours of playing, I an be pretty sure I'd know I was bored. I could see if someone was giving me a massage or something during the game, on every session, and I somehow mistook the enjoyment of the massage with the enjoyment of playing. <br/><br/>To me this is just an example of taking something that is a small piece of science or social science and applying it where it might not cleanly fit. Again, if people want to draw on science or psychology and find that useful, I can understand. But I've seen so much snake oil in other industries when people take findings from other fields and misapply them. You see this all the time in business where people write entire books misapplying science so they can sell copies. I am sure there may be some application of these ideas if someone really understands them and knows what their practical limits are. I just am incredibly wary of that kind of information when it makes the rounds on forums like this, where we don't know the poster's credentials and it feels like people might be seeing what they want to see in the findings. It just reminds me too much of the guy who takes a lot of sound ideas and findings from Quantum Physics for example and uses it to write a book called "Quantum Selling" or something (and yes there is someone out there peddling this exact idea). I'm just not terribly convinced that a lot of the game designers who talk about psychology and other social science research, really understand it, or are ignoring their own biases as they apply it. And I think it is potentially dangerous ground for us to walk on.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450906/#Comment_450906" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-26T13:39:59+00:00" title="January 26, 2016  1:39PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, I mostly agree with you and there is certainly a lot of science being misappropriated. And my theories above are mostly just speculation, as I said. It might not be true. That said, I still fail to see why it would matter so much when the XP is given out, as long as it's given out according to clear criteria. If you've got two versions of Super Mario, one where there's a counter for your coins on the screen continuously and another where you only at the end of the level get to see how many coins you collected, I think the psychological response would be similar. The player knows they've collected a coin when it happens, even if it's not "given" until the end of the level. Similarly, a D&amp;D player who gets XP for gold knows they've received some XP when they get their hands on some gold, even if it's not formally rewarded until the end of the game.<br/><br/>Regarding associations, my conjecture was that you associate the XP with the fun you're actually having when you're playing, and then once the actual game stops being as fun, the continuous XP makes you keep playing, serving as a substitute for that fun, because the brain has gotten used to thinking that gathering XP is fun.

Stated as that, still doesn't sound convincing enough. I didn't wanted to go with the D&amp;D XP example since there's a lot more engrained there besides a reward. It's been told before that it's mainly meant to act as a pacing mechanism (otherwise you would just get "points" without mechanical value and not "experience points" that allow your character to level up) but I'll give it a try.<br/><br/>Why would I start or keep playing D&amp;D? The XP as a reward has nothing to do with it. There's the fun of learning, the tactical challenge and the <b>actually memorable moments</b> which you will often find attached to a really funny interpretation of a fumble, a cool interpretation of a critical, a surprising turn of the events either introduced by the players or GM, whenever someone came up with a great idea, exploited a loophole, etc. Ask anybody about their best D&amp;D moments and they will tell you something along those lines.<br/><br/>And maaaybe after that they will mention something along the lines of "we got 2000 XP for that" to somewhat quantify the event.<br/><br/>Do we actually relate XP to "fun"? well, the thing is, we can, specially if the XP was given mostly at those memorable moments. But it doesn't happen so often; we also get XP when we play though a frustrating session and equally relate XP to that. That's another reason I didn't want to use XP, because is a terrible example of a reward.<br/><br/>Does things improve when we change the reward to, say Hero Points? Well, quite a bit. Now we are only getting rewarded for certain kind of memorable moments. Doesn't take that those memorable moments could be kinda frustrating for the player who wanted to do something different (and maybe better for narration) but had to stick with the mechanic.<br/><br/>But then again, what is happening with our brains with the rewards themselves? We certainly don't feel anything for XP, Hero points or Fanmail, those are just concepts. The game says we're getting them for doing X. If enjoy doing X, this is wasted on me, right?<br/><br/>Yes, you're right until repetition hits and positive experiences accumulate, to the point where XP, Hero Points, Fanmail becomes a symbol of all the good moments you had, and then it's getting handed to you. It's only then that it becomes an actual reward, when you really give it that importance. Until then, it's non-sensical.<br/><br/>Ok, this time I searched some <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7769.html" rel="nofollow">science</a> to back me up. There's a lot of interesting stuff there and Randall Collins hasn't been the first one to write about this, but take it as pseudoscience if you want. Anyway, I was interested more in the part about how a group of people interacting focuses on symbols of the activity converting them into amplificators of emotions through repetition. Rituals. That's the word used all over the book. The theory perfectly applies to roleplaying and any object that sees repeated use, especially when those group of people are sharing an emotional moment of any kind.<br/><br/>Is my whole point clearer now?

However, like a lot of internet discussions, this sounds rather far-fetched to me because I don't think I've ever seen it.<br/><br/>I've seen groups get together to play RPGs which are not fun. Maybe because they've been doing it for five years straight every Monday and it's become a habit. Or maybe because every once in a while it IS fun, and they seek those fleeting moments. Or because they make a point of having dinner together and the gaming is just an excuse to see each other. Or because gaming has become their *identity*, and NOT going to play D&amp;D on Monday night would mean having to rethink their life.<br/><br/>I don't think I've <b>ever</b> seen a group play without having fun because they collect XPs/Hero Points/whatever in-game reward.<br/><br/>I've seen that in computer games: you have to spend time collecting awards or points to "level up" your character or access a part of the game, so that you can keep up to your friends, or perhaps you want to beat your all-time record so you keep playing even though you're not really enjoying the process.<br/><br/>Can anyone describe to me a personal experience where this happened, how it was harmful/led to people having a bad time, and how it could have been fixed by changing the reward structure of the game?<br/><br/>I find it difficult to imagine.

Good moments have to happen naturally, they can't be forced.<br/><br/>Ok, once tangible rewards have become symbols and acquired real value to the players, do they motivate them enough to stand a boring session?

No. We were motivated by competition. Heck, it was almost hatred. We worked together to ruin the GM plans, derrail the story, render his NPCs and monsters ineffective. The GM incentivized us into this, into powergaming. He fudged rolls, he bent, broke, misinterpreted and ignored rules to his convenience, came up with unfair houserules at the worst moment and such. He justified this with rule zero, some sick interpretation of how he learned to play old school and things like that.<br/><br/>I kept going for a while deluded with the hope that some parts of the campaign would be just like it was at the beggining, where the GM still played D&amp;D "with training wheels", a few really good sessions where the story was more important than the rules and we could roleplay circles around challenges.<br/><br/>XP still doesn't mean much to me up to this date.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450913/#Comment_450913" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-26T18:34:54+00:00" title="January 26, 2016  6:34PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2016 7:05PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But is the dice roll itself a <i>tangible</i> reward?

Even better, because the emotion they help build could be good or bad and this uncertainty adds even more emotion to dice rolling.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Tangible rewards in roleplaying games - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20518/tangible-rewards-in-roleplaying-games/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Tangible rewards in roleplaying games - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20518/tangible-rewards-in-roleplaying-games/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="So I was thinking a bit about Fan Mail and D&amp;D XPs.

I have to start over at 1st level, so I guess I'll be joining the Tuesday night session for a while. I'll show those noobs how to advance faster.

Hopefully they'll like that too.<br/><br/>Side impact: Helps group gel on what they find preferable in terms of the fiction.<br/><br/>So fan mail isn't just Scooby Snacks, it actually has an important function in getting people on the same page over the long haul, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450918/#Comment_450918" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-26T21:24:51+00:00" title="January 26, 2016  9:24PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2016 9:53PM by Airk.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really feel like I've read the "Rickard says science says <i>X</i> about game rewards (Last time I think it involved the word 'bribes') and everyone disagrees with him about the applicability and relevance of the studies he cites" thread already.<br/><br/>Is something new being brought to the table here?

I've been trying to add something new to the discussion I think it's really important to clarify Rickard's post, but to no avail. I even tried using science but at some point it was established we shouldn't science anymore, because it's either pseudoscience or it's being misinterpreted. <br/><br/>At this point I'm probably coming off as an attention whore, which wasn't my intention at all, I just kinda got desperate when I finally think I've got something important to say that could stop the flames and help us understand each other. It even wasn't something I just thought of, but something I've been researching as a comic artist as well. Anyway, it's up there in my last four or five posts, so everyone, my apologies for insisting <i>way </i>too much on it, I'll just let it go.<br/><br/>Moving foward,\n<blockquote><br/>Does anyone other than Rickard have any datapoints from people who have enjoyed games less when they had an "extrinsic" (Quotes because honestly, a game reward that has a value in the game doesn't seem very extrinsic to me) reward involved?<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI did used Fate Aspects on a homebrew hack once. These aspects were more like the character background instead of skills (we had a separate skill list). Players understood how it worked, but then they ended up gaming the system to get points to use later. As a result, the scenes where they compelled their Aspects negatively were more like short comedy gags and totally broke the immersion. When I invoked their negative aspects, it felt... well, part railroady, since more than anything I used it to keep them playing in character. Using a regular alignment mechanic would have achieved the same.<br/><br/>Can't say it wasn't fun by itself, but it was a different fun than the one I intended by design. My group of players still enjoy using them, though, but I prefer not to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450927/#Comment_450927" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-27T16:17:25+00:00" title="January 27, 2016  4:17PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing people don't understand about Flags, and this is *very much* related to the point of this thread, is that you have to write Flags that you yourself are genuinely interested in pursuing. Sounds like that wasn't in place in your most recent example, WarriorMonk, though it's easy to find others! I've certainly seen it in games that I've run or played. I was in a Burning Wheel game once or twice with a player who said they wanted more fighting but refused to write more violence-oriented Beliefs. Confusing, until you really understand the mindset that puts all the responsibility on the GM for making the game fun.<br/><br/>I mean, a whole lot of this is about responsibility sharing, right? If I'm GMing, I am presumably motivated to make the game as fun as possible for all the players, but throw me a bone here! Conversely, I have *definitely* frequently been the player who will "roleplay" (in the sense of doing a consistent character voice and mannerisms) no matter what, BUT it is frustrating not to have that effort reciprocated. So for me, it's not about the "reward" per se, but about facilitating a more egalitarian weight of responsibility for both character portrayal and scenario creation.<br/><br/>Not shockingly, I also couldn't agree more with Eero's comment about standards. Theoretically, you *can't* just "game the system" to get more Fate points or whatever, because the game rules should direct you to only give out such points for real, genuine contributions to the game. It's not that hard to tell when someone is just fishing and not really invested, IME.<br/><br/>Finally, I <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> forever the Rising Principle of Gaminess.

I'm thinking about this a bit more, and the more I think about it, the less good I think the sports metaphor that is being thrown around is.<br/><br/>Because all of this stuff is being designed INTO the game.  So it's not about "playing basketball is the game, and giving out trophies is the extrinsic reward" at all.   If we want to keep using that metaphor, what we have is "Roleplaying is like dribbling and passing, and getting Fanmail/Aiki/Fate Points/Artha/whatever is like scoring a basket."  Basketball would be a pretty bad game if all you did was stand there taking free throws, but having the goal of scoring baskets gives you a direction for all of your dribbling and passing.  The two aspects are mutually complimentary and the game with both is more fun than the game with either one alone.  Neither one is "extrinsic" because both are part of the game.  And games benefit from goals.  And formalized goals are better than "Today I'm going to try to play with only my left hand." <br/><br/>Viewing Fanmail/Aiki/whatever as "rewards" at all is perhaps the more fundamental flaw than thinking of them as "extrinsic rewards" but both are equally wrong.  These are goals, not rewards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450932/#Comment_450932" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-27T20:12:41+00:00" title="January 27, 2016  8:12PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: responsibility-sharing and group standards, yeah, that's the kind of stuff I had in mind when I said, "sometimes the momentary enjoyment of one player is not the most important thing to consider."

(it was their first choice when I gave them freedom to come up with aspects themselves.)<br/><br/>Nowadays as I create the world along with the players I also ask them to come up with goals, first for their group and then for their characters, considering what they wrote down as the group's objective. So far it has worked better than aspects and hasn't broken immersion when used during the game.<br/><br/>I agree that you can tell whenever someone isn't invested, but at the time I used Aspects, it was a mechanic I imposed for testing reasons so I couldn't really call on the players to take it more seriously. Especially since I also limited what could be used and what not; it felt like I was already imposing too much on them to also tell them they were playing it wrong. It was a totally my bad for taking such a poor approach to it.<br/><br/>Despite that, I can't shake the feeling that mechanics that reward players aren't actually for everyone. Some players notice them enough to find them intrusive and immersion-breaking, others don't get it and start gaming the system to win, and we're talking about people whose intuitive reaction to those mechanics is actually that game-breaking. For others these mechanics become a second-nature and ingrain so deep in them that later they can't conceive a game without these sort of rewarding mechanics.<br/><br/>Knowing about this, as a designer I think I should use this sort of things with more care and explain their use in the game with yet more care.

For instance, I haven't been able to play any pokemon game for long but I've got a group of friends that grew up playing those and have fun grinding in any kind of MMORPG. For me, if the game doesn't allow me to experience a story of blocks it with grinding quests, it bores me to death.<br/><br/>You also have clicking games, where the challenge is as simple as keep clicking your mouse. You get a reward after a few repetitions in two forms: your clicks now "do more things at once" and your reward is "bigger" now. You're still following the same pattern, you click and get a reward after a few repetitions, the game doesn't really get more complex over time. And surprisingly, people do play these games a lot. Now that's lazy design exploiting psychology.<br/><br/>But you're right. Somehow, this isn't enough for tabletop rpgs. Our expectations on the fun machines can give us are on a totally different level of the fun we expect to have when playing with other people. That's why we resent when either the GM or some player doesn't contribute to the game as much as we feel we're contributing, or as much as we think their role demands.<br/><br/>Games with tangible rewards demand players committed to control and police themselves on the use and abuse of said rewards. The usual atmosphere you get when you ask people to "play" with you is quite different than the one you get when you ask people to "have fun creating a story" with you. There's fun implied in both, but the first one also implies less control and less respect to the forms. To top that, for roleplayers there distinction is already fuzzy enough that for us both atmospheres are more or less the same. <br/><br/>That's another reason why I believe that, if you're going to use rewards in some fashion, you must make the design crystal clear about the atmosphere, about how much control must be over the rewards and how to handle player's lack of control over them, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Make this clear and rewards will work better every session, will mean more for the players and the way to obtaining them will become enough of a ritual that players will always respect it and refrain from exploiting it. Disrespect the rewards and they will spiral down the game into gonzo or worse, destroying all story oriented value it could had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450949/#Comment_450949" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-28T17:34:31+00:00" title="January 28, 2016  5:34PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's extremely important to align the creative goals of the games with its mechanism, and then to explain very clearly to the players how those things fit together.<br/><br/>We know that if you play Apocalypse World "to win", you'll probably get into trouble.

And here's something we might want to be wary of as game designers. If you're doing something that's fun and you get a reward, your brain might think that you're actually doing it for the reward, and if you stop the reward, you'll likely find it less fun. So if you're playing D&amp;D and stop giving out XP, players might well tire even though they'd have enjoyed it without the XP if that was the deal from the beginning. And, since the XP never stop coming and you keep gaining levels, you might keep playing because you associate those XPs with the fun you had in the beginning, even if you're not really having as much fun anymore. So that might be a thing.<br/><br/>I think it's really hard to generalize, though, but I think it's an interesting thing to have in mind when discussing reward systems.</blockquote>\nAn interesting point.\n<blockquote>But reward systems are so much more than just this. They're pacing mechanisms, they're thematic statements (you get better at magic by killing people), they're signals from the author as to what the game is about, etc.</blockquote>\nAs for the last point, thinking about rewards as feedback helps develop the game beyond using rewards. How can the author signal what the game is about through feedback?

I wonder, however, if this isn't more of an example of using rewards as a pointer? Remember the first two points in achieving flow?<br/><br/>1. One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and progress. This adds direction and structure to the task.<br/>2. The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback.<br/><br/>This applies both to using tangible rewards or not. Yes, you can use rewards to make the players do what you, as a designer, want them to do. They create a clear set of goals. This is, in my book, a faulty way of looking at it - it's when the designer tries to make his or her goal a goal for the players. It creates a thinking pattern that use rewards as a tool for building a game system.<br/><br/>If I were instead to design whatever Beliefs stands for, I would make it part of the interaction: they cannot play the game if they don't hit the Beliefs.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7f-p7aVa9eUjIluPvKsw2zuMS-99RvxXndf5IdQV6zPZ3fFXTr1SY1cRk-dcgtJ5DKVo=w482-h324-no"/><br/><br/>When I think about designing a game system from that perspective, I can look beyond using extrinsic rewards in my design and instead design for intrinsic rewards.

You don't think of Angry Birds as a game that creates frustration but something else that is related to how you handle frustration: it's an "awful", "annoying" or "pointless" game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450971/#Comment_450971" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-29T18:22:06+00:00" title="January 29, 2016  6:22PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2016 6:32PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We got a lot of different ways of enjoying a roleplaying game so this might obscure what we're talking about in this thread.

What limiting principles are you referring to? The way I see it, the game actively encourages players to strive to get experience.<br/></blockquote>\nMy experience with ALL of Vincent's games (I haven't played all of them, but all the ones I *have* played were like this) is that the game design basically doesn't care about this point. There is always a set of incentives which seems overly strong for what it does, and can be used to "push buttons" to get what you want. A traditional gamer might say that the games are "broken", because they can be so easily exploited.<br/><br/>However, it seems to me (and, of course I'm putting words in someone else's mouth here, so my odds of being wrong are high) that Vincent's goal here is to present a game which is played well and right by players in the correct mindset. He doesn't care if the game "breaks" when played in a different way.<br/><br/>It seems that the game says, "Hey, if you *like* the idea of playing it this way, go for it! You'll gave a great time. If not, go play another game."<br/><br/>The principles in AW which work against this are the admonitions to the players (including the GM) to focus on the fiction: for players, it's mainly to treat your characters as real people with real desires. I think that, as a player, you're expected to apply some personal discipline to separate these things, and think from the perspective of your character *first*, and then see how it translates into the game.<br/><br/>I agree that, in play, there is a bit of tension between these things. You have mechanical incentives occasionally at odds with the stuff you care about in the story/characters/fiction. It doesn't *usually* ruin the game for me, but I can easily see how it *could* (and it occasionally has).<br/><br/>Here's an alternative view: a friend of mine says that part of what makes AW a successful game (particularly in terms of popularity and financial success) is that it offers a little of something to everyone. It has the gripping survival drama, the action, the interpersonal conflicts, but also elements of system mastery and reward-chasing, so that players with different points of focus can see their object of desire in the game and play together.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450986/#Comment_450986" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-30T20:04:46+00:00" title="January 30, 2016  8:04PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't ruin the game for me, either.

And since OUAT is competitive, there's no problem in using points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450988/#Comment_450988" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-30T20:17:18+00:00" title="January 30, 2016  8:17PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>In computer games, especially MMORPGs, they cover up non-fun core interaction systems with rewards systems (ex. grinding).<br/><br/>I think we have the same problem with TTRPGs (ex. challenge based tasks).</blockquote>\nYou generally don't get rewards for challenge-based tasks.

All of which makes me think that ultimately XP for actually doing stuff (I\u2019ve never found this aspect of D&amp;D-type games to be as problematic as other folks seem to) is the best form of in-game reward. However, there are some exceptions:<br/><br/>1. The sort of fan mail that's a way of either the GM or another player rewarding a player for \u2018a nice touch\u2019, as you do in <i>Tenra Bansho Zero</i>, and indeed in Japanese Kabuki theatre, where members of the audience cognisant with both the play and the actors will actually call out an actor\u2019s name - <i>Enoshimaya!</i> - at critical points if they think the performer has acted the part particularly well. It\u2019s like giving a post on G+ a +1. It's a nice thing to receive, and it doesn\u2019t lead to players gaming the system. <br/><br/>2. The GM awarding a player a point not for good roleplaying <i>per se</i>, but for good <i>generic</i> characterisation, i.e. not playing up to a motivation or flaw but really bringing out the role of a widowed mother of a dead confederate soldier in post-Civil War USA or what have you.<br/><br/>3. The GM dishing out points for entering into the spirit of the game\u2019s overall narrative or focus. This could be for either a) showing by your roleplaying that you\u2018ve absorbed the atmosphere of a small town in Reconstruction Mississippi (yes, I know, that one\u2019s a bit nebulous), or b) successfully bringing out the <i>tone</i> of a game built around certain tropes, particularly those that try to replicate cinematic style. Thus, the GM in a <i>Dead of Night</i> game I was in gave out an impulse point when a couple of players decided to split the party (which often happens in slasher films), and the players in a martial arts-focused Feng Shui game I was in received praise from the GM for executing stylish but unrealistic Jackie Chan type moves (I don\u2019t remember if <i>Feng Shui</i> has a rewards system, IIRC it doesn\u2019t, but that\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019m talking about).<br/><br/>Anyway, them\u2019s me two cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451024/#Comment_451024" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-01T05:57:14+00:00" title="February  1, 2016  5:57AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>3.

Shouldn't "entering into the spirit of the game" be its own reward? It's bizarre, to me, to reward that outwardly. (I suppose I could see it as a temporary educational too, however. The only real useful metric I can see it having on play is allowing one player to easily signal when contributions suit her perceived sense of taste or style - useful if you're trying to learn together, but ultimately not terribly relevant to play once everyone is sufficiently oriented.)<br/><br/>However, the Dead of Night example is interesting. I haven't played DoN, so I don't know which is the case, but I've seen that kind of mechanic work in different ways.<br/><br/>1) The game is set up so that taking the genre-appropriate action is the most beneficial or most effective option available to the players. (For instance, you have to split the party three times to get enough Traits to overcome the dreaded monster. This kind of thing can often work as a pacing mechanism, as XP does in D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>2) The designer wanted to get the players out of the mindset of playing a certain way, so s/he included a rule to reward what they felt was the "right way to play". This, to me, is sloppy design - again, unless used as a temporary educational tool. It's utterly pointless for people who are already on the right page and understand the purpose of the game.<br/><br/>3) Similar to 1), the rules are set up so that certain genre-appropriate actions can be taken without fear of them leading to a state of loss. If you want characters trying desperately to survive the zombie apocalypse, but you ALSO want them to split up a lot, you can remove the game's pressure against the genre-relevant action by adding a reward or benefit to that action. <br/><br/>Maybe you would never submit willingly to an enemy, because then who knows what they might do to you! But it's very in-genre, so we include a rule which states that when you submit to an enemy's will, they can no longer harm you, or you derive some other benefit, to compensate for the "losing" position you are entering.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where I fall on 3), whether it's useful or lazy design - I'd probably judge it case-by-case, depending on how it was handled, and can imagine both really functional cases and terribly off-putting ways to do this.<br/><br/>Rickard, I'm curious which of these examples are offensive to YOUR eyes, and why.

If you want to use it to make a point, you should explain the point.  Nothing in the diagram explains how extrinsic rewards are being used to "cover up" anything.  Indeed, to be completely honest, without more context, it's hard for me to make a lot of sense of that diagram on any level.<br/><br/>That aside, I think you are incorrect about why people are making games competitive;  It's not that people are making these games competitive because they don't know how to "make it fun" otherwise. They are making them competitive because they don't know how to make them <i>games</i> otherwise.<br/><br/>For very many people, being a "game" implies having goals, or objectives.  It's not saying that you can't have fun without those, but that you may not have a game, and people looking for a game may come away feeling like the experience lacked direction and they weren't sure what they were supposed to do.  I liken this to the "blank page" phenomenon - if you give someone a blank sheet of paper and say "Write a story!" a lot of people will struggle.  If you give them a sheet of paper and say "Write a story about a dragon, a mountain, and an old man." most people will have a much easier time.   Undirected creation is hard, confusing, and something many people aren't accustomed to or good at.  Adding a goal to a game directs that creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451055/#Comment_451055" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-01T23:53:00+00:00" title="February  1, 2016 11:53PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2016 12:02AM by Rickard.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>1) The game is set up so that taking the genre-appropriate action is the most beneficial or most effective option available to the players.

It's a gray area though, because I don't have enough information. Are the players just given bonuses or do they get something else from it, like having more traits give them an opportunity to adopt to what the monster is doing? Can the monster only be defeated when they got a certain amount of traits? (Note, I have nothing against getting points if it's a competition but we can use this example anyway to discuss tangible rewards.)<br/><br/>Some other examples:<br/>- I got tired of the party always walking around with drawn weapons so I made drawing a weapon a free action. Suddenly, no one had a drawn weapon. (I removed the penalty)<br/>- I wanted the players to discuss tactics, so I designed a restricted pot of points that they generated each turn AND that they could spend these points to activate each others' powers. Now they had something to discuss about.<br/>- I wanted the players to form a story in their head so I had them constantly say a sentence each that weren't related to the previous sentence. I relied on the human brain to want to puzzle the pieces together, which meant that the players were active in creating a story both through sentences and in their head.<br/>- I wanted the players to create relations between people so I had them take on the role of a detective that solved a murder, and gave them a framework of how to ask questions to give all people relations to each other.<br/>- I wanted my players to describe their actions so I designed a game where they had to describe their way out of trouble without any mechanics (skill rolls) doing it for them.<br/>- The game designer for <b>Magicians</b> want to teach players Korean. They have to speak Korean in order to cast a spell.<br/><br/>- My brother wanted actors to move on stage so he designed a game where they had to move in order to play the game.<br/>- I wanted my soccer team consisting of ten year olds to warm up, so I let them play games where they moved. I could had instead ordered them to run around the field but playing games made them wanting to move.<br/>- I wanted my seventy year old dad to bring his phone with him when he took long walks in the wood. He always forgot, so I installed Google Fitness and now he brings his phone with him every day.<br/><br/>- In <b>Feng Shui</b>, I present the genre so everyone knows what they are getting into. The pitch of the game is incredible important because it creates the right mindset for how the players should take on the mechanics. I enforce the pitch by being a good role model as for how the NPCs behave.<br/>- I also comment their actions in style with "That really felt like it was brought from an action movie". (acknowledgment through verbal reward)<br/>- If I didn't like it, I would respond with a reaction from the NPCs and then be a role model again. (acknowledgment through building.)<br/><br/>It's, to me, lazy when if you replace all these above with "Do as I want, and get a point".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451056/#Comment_451056" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-02T00:12:20+00:00" title="February  2, 2016 12:12AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, interesting.<br/><br/>From your original post, I thought you had a much more hardcore position than that.

And I think that a hardline position would name very many of those things as "extrinsic rewards". I think, also, that systems such as Artha and Fanmail deserve more of a look than comparing them to Skinner Box rewards. I think this is especially true when you consider something like Artha, which is handed out in a very non-Skinner way: you have to have a reflection period after each session where you discuss the events of the session and decide how your character's exploits earned them Artha.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451063/#Comment_451063" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-02T06:13:46+00:00" title="February  2, 2016  6:13AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, to suss out your position, Rickard, is this right?<br/><br/>If you speak Korean, you get to cast a spell: good game design.<br/>If you speak Korean, you get a point, which you can use to cast spells: lazy game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451065/#Comment_451065" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-02T07:24:11+00:00" title="February  2, 2016  7:24AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something people really don't grok about Artha and Beliefs:<br/><br/>You get Persona Artha for either accomplishing a Belief <i>or</i> for dramatically going against it. (You also get Fate Artha for working towards, but not definitively resolving, one of your Beliefs.) That's one of the major reasons the whole thing is an organizing principle, and not a bribe. The Beliefs are what you, the group, are supposed to engage with in the session. If no one is earning Artha, it's almost certain that the session was meandering and directionless, i.e., not fun, ergo, Rising's Principle of Gaminess is perfectly intact.<br/><br/>Something related but bigger that people tend not to grok:<br/><br/>Failure is supposed to hurt and be genuinely undesirable. That principle is one of the major failsafes against people "gaming the system" in petty ways.<br/><br/>Of course, you need to accept your character's setbacks with good grace, but in a well-functioning game you simply can't pummel them for points over and over.<br/><br/>And I'll admit that I've seen GMs give out, say, Fate points for self-compels that had no real consequences.

None of these 'reward schemes' are necessarily connected to 'negative emotions' and no one is, I think, suggesting that they are some sort of one-size-fits-all tool for getting people comfortable.  I'd also suggest that you probably want to build a safe and comfortable atmosphere regardless, so this whole line of thought feels like an entirely different axis that lies oblique to the discussion.</blockquote>\nSorry, I was thinking specifically of people I know, as the first thing I saw when I readed games which specifically rewarded "roleplaying" over doing other things in the game, was a tool to help my powergaming friends into roleplaying more. It failed as I wrote earlier, as they kept gaming the system and ruining the roleplaying part. In other cases, when I tested a system that doesn't reward at all for anything and uses several mechanisms and techniques to build trust among the players, I got a better response. Today I don't even dish XP in D&amp;D because of that and pace the leveling by fiat, giving each player on of their next levell class features/benefits per session or two. I can even decide which to give them in a way that connects better with the fiction. But I'm derrailing, so enough of that.<br/><br/>Sorry that I can't read all the last responses yet, I've got some work to do but first I'll leave you with two things that came up to my mind when reading some of the posts:<br/><br/>-Another good use of the rewards is as feedback. I think it was mentioned before but as I can't find where, I'll point it again. What I mean is like, when you roleplay to your best but you're not sure if the rest of the group really appreciates it or if you're coming out as a spotlight hoarder or something. And then you get a reward from another player, that for you will mean "Great, keep doing that!"<br/><br/>-Also, what about making a reward mechanic that isn't engrained with the rest of the game mechanics? One that you don't need to keep going forever? It doesn't even need to be points, it can be just a ritualized procedure at the end of the session or between scenes where everyone has to mention one thing another player did that they liked that they would enjoy seeing again. <br/><br/>-About my last point; turning that into tokens makes it a lot easier for people who feel uncomfortable giving or taking praise. I believe these type of players and others should be always considered in the design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451077/#Comment_451077" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-02T19:57:23+00:00" title="February  2, 2016  7:57PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2016 8:04PM by Rickard.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hm.

We *only* speak Korean when we use magic!<br/><br/>The second, however, gives more of a benefit to learning conversational phrases, and therefore might be better for encouraging language learning. We want to use Korean as often as possible.<br/><br/>In the first case, I might learn how to say, "Burn you with fire!"<br/><br/>In the second case, I'm better off learning phrases I can use often, like, "Nice to meet you."<br/><br/>Such a subtle difference, and yet it creates quite a different game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451079/#Comment_451079" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-02T21:22:00+00:00" title="February  2, 2016  9:22PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Example two, you can do it but you get a bonus if you speak Korean.

The point doesn't give you a "bonus" - it lets you do something you wouldn't have been able to do otherwise.  The two examples both require you to speak Korean if you want to cast a spell.

You want your goal to be fun doing (interaction), not something that you need to bribe others to do (with tangible rewards).<br/><br/>You want people to enjoy doing descriptions in <b>Drakar och bananer</b> without having to be lured to do it with bonuses. You must do the descriptions, otherwise you wont understand, in most cases, what's going on. <b>Exalted </b>is an example of lazy design when it comes to descriptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451089/#Comment_451089" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-03T16:57:17+00:00" title="February  3, 2016  4:57PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you do that though?

While this can even imply some kind of discrimination from the designer's part towards players with certain habits, I realize that nobody actually means that.<br/><br/>But in the end, that's what it feels like for many GMs and players. I think the main reason why I hack and design comes from there: I like lots of things from other people's designs, but often I find a crucial exploitable feature that could ruin the fun for my group, so I end up tearing it apart and throwing together the things I like, then playtesting and correcting until either those mechanics stop making problems, I find a way to put the problems they create to good use or I just drop them entirely.<br/><br/>Most of the times the problem isn't the mechanic itself but the way it is explained, as having the apropiate frame of mind when using it is crucial for it's success. For example, if you try to play Fiasco like it was D&amp;D you would totally miss the point of the game and ruin the fun of the group. You have to explain it to your trad group in lines like "it's like we're all trying to get an oscar for dramatic interpretation, so the most flawed, human and unlucky bastard of a character wins, even if they die, get in prision, ends up ruined, crazy or whatever"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451098/#Comment_451098" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T06:17:07+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  6:17AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On one level it's not that strange. You can't make a game that caters for everyone. But also, there are lots of activities you can make part of the interaction, and you can design different interactions that different people can use. One player plays the magician, and she has to speak Korean to cast spells. Another plays the acrobat, who has to make colorful descriptions to do awesome stunts.<br/><br/>So I agree with Rickard to a large extent, here. At the same time, it's not that simple, of course. You can still do a lot of stuff with bonus points that I don't think is lazy and that I think is hard to do without them. for example, in my game Det sj\xe4tte inseglet, characters are valiant heroes with moral flaws. Players offer bonus dice to each other for doing terrible things. The players have to balance getting enough dice to be able to accomplish their goals, without sacrificing too much of their moral character. Some end up dying tragic but heroic deaths, some end up morally bankrupt assholes, and some are on the line inbetween, doing questionable things but also trying to be good people. It's a mechanic that works great, but it's not a simple "I want you to do as much of X as possible, so you get points for it" thing. Rather, the offer of dice for an action makes it clear that it's morally tainted, and in a way discourages people from wanting to do it (when played in the right mindset).<br/><br/>I wanted to offer an example of a way to use bonus points that I don't think falls into the trap Rickard is talking about. <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>, you've played D6I, what do you think of that mechanic? Maybe it can be interpreted as "I want players to be tempted to commit terrible acts, so I make that part of the interaction"? Dunno. My point is that "bonus points" aren't automatically external rewards, either.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>But hey, here's another thing: I think that another way of solving the problem is by limiting the number of times you can get the bonus. So in D&amp;B, players can only use a specific item once in an encounter. This is to make sure they use different items, because otherwise it'd be boring; they'd always use their best one. In my mind, this is an issue with "The best way of playing should be the most fun". But maybe we could also frame it as "making the designer's goal part of the interaction"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451100/#Comment_451100" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T09:58:00+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  9:58AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2016 10:19AM by Rickard.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Not only that but it is establishing a metric for 'good design' that eliminates a huge chunk of potential players.

You are arguing that designing for this particular audience would be bad and lazy design. Basically you said 'don't design X, X is bad and lazy design'. Someone pointed out, 'some people like X'. Your response is to not 'design for people who like X'. Unless I am misreading you. <br/><br/>Again, maybe I am just having trouble understanding some of your points. But I feel like you are insisting certain designs be avoided because you have some kind of moral issue with certain types of reward. But your argument for why they are bad is so esoteric and relies heavily on a big list of books and articles (which I am just not convinced anyone here really has a firm handle on). I suppose I've already made the points about my concerns about drawing on a field we aren't experts in (where it is very easy to misunderstand where the current research is and whether it can or ought to be applied to an RPG). But I don't think it is a minor point. Especially when you are so strident and insistent on your position.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451103/#Comment_451103" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T13:32:25+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  1:32PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On one level it's not that strange.

But in my experience if the game is too focused, you tend to end up with fewer players at the table. The more the game is able to be enjoyed by a wide range of players with different tastes and goals, the more you can get to the table. Neither one is worse, they each have their advantages. But for me, I'd rather make a game that lots of different players can enjoy. All I am saying is I don't think establishing a metric for good design that completely ignores certain kinds of players or only allows for narrow and focused design, is very helpful. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451104/#Comment_451104" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T14:24:55+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  2:24PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick tangents:<br/>Do rewards matter outside of campaign play?<br/>If yes, how does reward work outside of campaign play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451105/#Comment_451105" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T14:29:53+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  2:29PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this part of Rickard's argument (correct me if I'm wrong, Rickard) can be formulated as "Don't try to make people do things they don't enjoy".

If he doesn't like those kinds of reward systems, I'm fine with that. Where I take issue is using the "science!" argument to make it some kind of egregious thing that designers should stay away from, or the whole "it's lazy and bad design" angle. Again, he might not enjoy it, I personally might not even be that into it, but I know I've encountered players who enjoy that sort of reward system (even if it is rewarding them for an activity they already enjoy). But my major issue here is the esoteric nature of the discussion, that he's dipping into a sampling of social science research and building a design philosophy that is highly proscriptive from it. And it just has the snake oil vibe I get from things like "Quantum Selling" where people take traces of science and social science and try to apply them to business. I watched the videos and read the articles he posted. I'm just not convinced by any of this that we should be applying these ideas directly to RPGs.

It is possible I misunderstood him, but he seems to be saying games ought to be designed a particular way (that X is good design, and Y is bad design) but if people happen to prefer Y over X, we shouldn't be designing for them.

Let them play something else instead.<br/></blockquote>\nThat said, <b>David </b>and I have already talked about using tangible rewards to make people do something that they initially this is <i>boring </i>to hopefully have them learn the fun in doing it, so you can abandon the tangible reward later.<br/><br/><br/>And that is i think, an important part of reward mechanics. It is a very direct and honest way to say <br/><b>This is what i want the game to be about! </b><br/>Maybe replace boring with <b>insignificant</b>, or <b>something they have not even realized is important. </b> They steer us towards the experience the game wants us to have. <br/>Why are eye-openers bad?<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>In extension of that, Rickard, i want to get it straight:<br/> So, in your mind, Luke Cranes design is faulty:<br/>Because it grants a bonus with its artha points?<br/>Is it the idea of earning something you can spend?<br/>Is it the idea that you cannot win challenging rolls if you do not spend "artha" (barring already opened rolls.)<br/>Would it be "ok" in your mind if the points directly caused advancement, just as rolling itself does in that game.<br/><br/>Because generally, burning wheel stories tend to be about painful growth and change. I am trying to align this with the korean magic example.\n<blockquote><br/>However, even such minor differences have effects on the game's design:<br/><br/>I'd say that, rather, the biggest difference between option 1 and option 2 is how speaking Korean relates to using magic in the game. In one case, you speak for magical effects (and have to learn words or phrases with that in mind); in the other, you can speak whenever, and it translates into greater magical ability later in the game.<br/><br/>The first is more interesting, to me, and gives players a direct reason to study *specific* words. We *only* speak Korean when we use magic!<br/><br/>The second, however, gives more of a benefit to learning conversational phrases, and therefore might be better for encouraging language learning. We want to use Korean as often as possible.<br/><br/>In the first case, I might learn how to say, "Burn you with fire!"<br/><br/>In the second case, I'm better off learning phrases I can use often, like, "Nice to meet you."<br/><br/>Such a subtle difference, and yet it creates quite a different game!</blockquote>\nI cannot see how the <i>"gain points which you can at any time use to cast magic by saying korean phrases"</i> is worse than <i>"speak korean to cast magic."</i>   All i feel/observe/percieve/think is that the game becomes different, not that it becomes worse. the interaction merely changes, but it does not deteriorate.\n<blockquote><br/>Make your design goal part of the interaction, instead of trying to make it the players' goal. You want your goal to be fun doing (interaction), not something that you need to bribe others to do (with tangible rewards).</blockquote>\nWhy not do both? They are not opposed? <br/>Mix Keys from TSOY and svart af kval, vit af lust.<br/>Unleash the beast to be able to overthrow the elder vampire with all that entails. Now, add these two keys into the mix (they are badly written, and very direct and non-interprettable, but i think my point is still clear.)<br/><br/>Key of the servant<br/>When you abide the elder vampires wishes, gain 3 exp<br/>When you oppose the elder vampire, gain 1 exp.<br/>buyout: you unleash the beast and overthrow the elder vampire and spare him, letting him assume your position in mercy, gain 5 exp.<br/><br/>Key of the mongrel<br/>when you speak directly against the elder vampire, gain 3 exp.<br/>when you speak for the elder vampire, gain 1 exp.<br/>Buyout: when you prostrate yourself to the elder vampire and beg forgiveness, gain 5 exp.<br/><br/>Now, call the exp "right to rule", to summon the right atmosphere,  and let them use their it manipulate the hierarchy - but never directly overthrow anyone. And now, more people will play the game and enjoy it.<br/>God dammit, i want to make that game: black of bird, white of lady.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Some people like being rewarded, they are just as much a worthy player group as anyone else? If i make a game with tangible rewards, i may be excluding people who play RPG's who hate those rewards, but i include those who like them?\n<blockquote><br/>You want people to enjoy doing descriptions in <b>Drakar och bananer</b> without having to be lured to do it with bonuses. You must do the descriptions, otherwise you wont understand, in most cases, what's going on. <b>Exalted </b>is an example of lazy design when it comes to descriptions.</blockquote>\nThere are bonuses in drakar och bananer: They are the trait levels added as yellow dice to the rolls you make. You may use a trait all that you want, but you need to include it for the bonus. That "need to include" is just as much bribery as anything else. The bonus just is not stored, it is just released immediately. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>It is as if the inclusion of tangible rewards, or the lack of them for other fanatics, are fingers pointing towards the moon. The experience the game wants to impart (the moon) becomes obscured by it, and these people cant redirect their gaze.<br/>A lot of us can see beyond both types, or care less for fingers than moons. Or we find that  having fingers makes it easier to show others were the moon is.<br/><br/>Why not make different kinds of games, some that apply only to the narrow sliver which likes one or the other, and also some with broader appeal, so one's friends can join together and have the fun they want?<br/><br/>God, i sound offensive, expressing myself in metaphors, but it conveys quite clearly what i mean.  I do not know which word other to use than fanatic, i wish i had access to a more comely, better fitting word.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451118/#Comment_451118" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T20:20:29+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  8:20PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2016 8:21PM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just explain the game better, put the players in the right frame of mind and motivate them better.

If you don't want to listen, if you just want to come up with arguments against something, then get the fuck out of this thread, because you just want to defend your view of the world.

It also <i>can</i> be designed without any kind of feedback loop. It also <i>can</i> decrease the intrinsic reward, depending on the reward or the situation.<br/><br/>"Get 1 XP for acting in character" is an example of all three. It creates a false choice (you don't have to do it, but then you're not understanding this game), it doesn't create a feedback loop (like, "act in character, and that will generate more situations where you can act in character), and it's  a mechanical reward instead of a social one, in a non-physical, non-competitive, and non-boring situation.\n<blockquote>In extension of that, Rickard, i want to get it straight:<br/> So, in your mind, Luke Cranes design is faulty:<br/>Because it grants a bonus with its artha points?<br/>Is it the idea of earning something you can spend?<br/>Is it the idea that you cannot win challenging rolls if you do not spend "artha" (barring already opened rolls.)<br/>Would it be "ok" in your mind if the points directly caused advancement, just as rolling itself does in that game.<br/><br/>Because generally, burning wheel stories tend to be about painful growth and change.

And now, more people will play the game and enjoy it.<br/>God dammit, i want to make that game: black of bird, white of lady.</blockquote>\nBecause you don't need the rewards if you design the game right, as with Svart av kval, vit av lust. You just added something to that game with this example that isn't necessary.\n<blockquote>You want people to enjoy doing descriptions in <b>Drakar och bananer</b> without having to be lured to do it with bonuses. /.../ <br/>There are bonuses in drakar och bananer:</blockquote>\nYep, and I wish in a sense there weren't. On the other hand, you're missing the point, where it's not always the easiest thing to use the highest trait all the time. That would challenge the players' creativity, which is the game's point.<br/><br/>However, it's possible to do that without bonuses, hence me wishing the bonuses didn't exist. (I assumed in this example that a competition wasn't present, because I <b>already mentioned</b> what I think about tangible rewards in a competition, which is actually the case in Drakar och bananer.)\n<blockquote>A lot of us can see beyond both types, or care less for fingers than moons. Or we find that  having fingers makes it easier to show others were the moon is.</blockquote>\n<b>As already mentioned</b>, some don't mind the rewards. It wont decrease their intrinsic motivation to do something. Or, as I have put it, tangible rewards does nothing to, or <i>can</i> decrease the intrinsic motivation. You just said it in a different way.<br/><br/>I can't believe that I have to say this over and over again. It's like some of you are saying "Hey, I'm not color blind so color blindness cannot exist". Well, some <i>are</i> affected in a negative way by rewards, believe it or not.\n<blockquote>Some people like being rewarded, they are just as much a worthy player group as anyone else? If i make a game with tangible rewards, i may be excluding people who play RPG's who hate those rewards, but i include those who like them?</blockquote>\nSure, you can put it that way. You can choose to ignore those players, just like I choose not to try to include every taste in my designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451137/#Comment_451137" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-05T03:10:30+00:00" title="February  5, 2016  3:10AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2016 3:16AM by Rickard.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So I agree with Rickard to a large extent, here. At the same time, it's not that simple, of course. You can still do a lot of stuff with bonus points that I don't think is lazy and that I think is hard to do without them. for example, in my game Det sj\xe4tte inseglet, characters are valiant heroes with moral flaws. Players offer bonus dice to each other for doing terrible things. The players have to balance getting enough dice to be able to accomplish their goals, without sacrificing too much of their moral character. Some end up dying tragic but heroic deaths, some end up morally bankrupt assholes, and some are on the line inbetween, doing questionable things but also trying to be good people. It's a mechanic that works great, but it's not a simple "I want you to do as much of X as possible, so you get points for it" thing. Rather, the offer of dice for an action makes it clear that it's morally tainted, and in a way discourages people from wanting to do it (when played in the right mindset).<br/><br/>I wanted to offer an example of a way to use bonus points that I don't think falls into the trap Rickard is talking about. <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>, you've played D6I, what do you think of that mechanic? Maybe it can be interpreted as "I want players to be tempted to commit terrible acts, so I make that part of the interaction"? Dunno. My point is that "bonus points" aren't automatically external rewards, either.</blockquote>\nThe points in this case creates a choice based on a fictional standpoint. I have nothing against that, just like I have nothing against it in <b>Burning Wheels</b>. Svart av kval does the same thing with beast commands.<br/><br/>One game that puzzles me is however <b>While the World End</b>. I can power game the shit out of that game, and it still creates a good story. It's a competitive storytelling game that actually works. You want to create relations to get the bonus, but the scenes these generates bring something to the story. You want to something create other types of scenes to receive a bonus, but the scenes are still important for what to come. The two win conditions are also weird because everybody looses.<br/><br/>I also guess the gamistic part of that game is more of a pacing mechanism, just like levels in Dungeons and Dragons. I really like how <b>David</b> pointed that out to me.

I like Wilhelm's games and I'd love to try it. I even have an old version of it in Swedish on my Kindle.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think I agree with some of Rickard's points, but I don't agree with his diagnosis. I think the deterring effect of tangible rewards for fun behavior is a red herring. I've yet to find an example of problematic reward system design mentioned in this thread which cannot be framed with the Rising Rule of Gaminess "The best way of playing should be the most fun". There's no need to invoke studies and psychology. Just look at the behavior rewarded by the system.<br/><br/>For example, I really don't like keys. I think keys are, if not bad design, then at least nonrobust design. I find it difficult to play a game with keys because I have to constantly decide between playing well and playing for fun. Sometimes triggering the key will be in line with what's fun, but then the reward is pointless, except as a pacing mechanism. The only time the reward makes sense is when I wasn't going to do what the key says, but then why wasn't I going to do it? Because I was going to do something else which I think would be a fun thing to do. So the game rewards me for doing things that are not fun. Not to mention the problems with "Did that trigger my key?" where I have to decide whether or not this was worth an XP and risk either feeling like I'm being greedy and taking undeserved points or feeling like I'm not getting the points I deserve (yes, this is probably a cultural thing).<br/><br/>Compare this with the aforementioned moral flaws in Det sj\xe4tte inseglet, where the reward system also creates a choice, but where both alternatives are good for the story. The game forces me to balance between power and corruption on one hand, and morality and weakness on the other. It creates a difficult and interesting choice. Keys do not.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So that's an argument about why this sort of reward system is bad (I'd talk about Burning Wheel, but I haven't played it or managed to get through the rulebook). Rickard would argue that the system is bad because it rewards creative behavior with tangible points, but I think that is an unnecessary detour. We don't need to talk about this controversial application of research at all. I agree with a lot of Rickard's conclustions, but not his premises.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451143/#Comment_451143" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-05T15:44:34+00:00" title="February  5, 2016  3:44PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Right now, I feel that you, Airk, and Bedrockbrendan isn't reading anything of what I'm saying.

Saying "Roleplay your character" will leave a lot of people going "Er, but how?" while saying "You get a point each time you do one of these list of things" gets results.  Maybe just saying "Here is a list of things" would suffice, but my experience is that the point acts as a reinforcement and recognition - you did a thing, so we give you a point to remember that you did the thing, so you want to do the thing again.   Whereas "You did the thing, everyone nods and the game goes on as if you hadn't done the thing" will rapidly cause people to forget about the thing unless it was so startlingly awesome (A very small proportion of moments are startlingly awesome in my experience) that the resulting rush of pleasure makes you remember.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451151/#Comment_451151" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-05T22:20:35+00:00" title="February  5, 2016 10:20PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Also, a list of "things you can do" can imply that it's an *exhaustive* list - i.e. no other options are possible - whereas a list of things you get points for might be better at communicating that other options are also on the table.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451152/#Comment_451152" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-05T23:00:25+00:00" title="February  5, 2016 11:00PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2016 11:01PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Simon, I read through "The Sixth Seal" in Google translate.

But yeah, I guess it depends on how the keys are written. Some are worse than others. Looking at TSOY, a lot of the keys are dependent on external situations delivered by others, so that's better, I think, and I can see how one can create interesting situations from it. Other keys are not so good. "You gain 1 XP whenever you see to it that your name and deeds are known, by bragging about them or making sure there are witnesses." This, to me, is a bad key which incentivizes nonfun play. But not all of them are like this, and maybe I've just had the misfortune of playing with bad keys.<br/><br/>Oh, and I'm sure people can have fun with it. People also have fun playing Once Upon a Time, but I still think it's a really bad design.<br/><br/>To give an example of a similar mechanic which I think works better, though, look at Dream Askew. It balances itself in that the tokens are gained by some actions and spent on other actions. This leads to diminishing returns, so you don't win much by hoarding lots and lots of tokens. There's a give-and-take that self-balances. Contrast this with an XP mechanic where more is always better (though tempered by the transcendence in TSOY, admittedly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451161/#Comment_451161" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-06T16:45:53+00:00" title="February  6, 2016  4:45PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TSoY Keys are very intentionally multifunctional, it's part of the (lazy?) design spec. Specifically, some Keys are intended as dramatic pacing flags ("Is it already time for this unstable state of things to combust and resolve itself?"), some are thematic communication vehicles ("Does this event that just now happened count as murder, what do you think?"), and some are character projection flags ("Should I maybe project my character's core nature more strongly into the inter-character interplay?"). Some are so strange that they fit none of the above categories. The game allows a very high level of customization in this regard in an attempt to be inclusive of a variety of personal needs and interests regarding the role you and your character might play in the game.<br/><br/>The foremost TSoY rule that "balances" XP take is scene framing: because you cannot buy more screen time with XP, the only thing you're <i>actually</i> doing by raking in more XP than some other player is positioning your character in a different way against the setting and other characters. For dramatic purposes it is just as good to be weak as it is to be strong. There is no value associated with fast XP gain per se in the game, except the cultural tendency of the target audience to be anxious to hurry up with character growth before the GM comes to their senses and closes the bank. (As one might imagine, the game plays very differently in your second campaign, once the players get the XP hoarding out of their systems. It's not a problem at the beginning either, though, as long as the Story Guide manages to support the players while insisting that only legit plays gain XP.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451164/#Comment_451164" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-06T18:24:13+00:00" title="February  6, 2016  6:24PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2016 6:26PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>I'm with Eero on this one - that's what I've seen in my Key-using games. (With the additional idea of "player orientation" - for someone who is unclear on what the game is about or what to do, they can be tremendously useful, turning a confusing, stalled game into something eventful and interesting.)<br/><br/>Given the Key trigger you've described, it's somewhat "weak" in terms of possible ramifications and yet I'd still not have any trouble using to generate interesting play. My first instinct would be to set up situations where the character has opportunities to achieve great things but there is also a need to be secretive about them. (For instance, a group of characters on a mission together - if one of them has this Key, it could lead to a bit of inter-character drama or even conflict.) <br/><br/>The result is very similar to how moral flaws function in The Sixth Seal: the player is faced with a choice to do something undesirable (but very much in-character) or suffer a mechanical setback. The example I just gave is a bit heavy-handed, because there is very little context. Given a more well-informed situation, things should be more interesting and nuanced. For instance, is there someone whose admiration the character craves? Maybe I would introduce his father and have them engage in a heart-to-heart, while also hinting that the father has allegiances to the press, someone undesirable, or so on.<br/><br/>Now, if XP was purely a bonus with no particular downsides, perhaps we could make the argument that it deserves some kind of counterbalance. However, in TSoY, much as in Apocalypse World, XP serves an important function in terms of dramatic pacing: it determines how much time we have before the character must confront the greatest conflicts in her path, and whether she is transformed by it and/or ends her story (e.g. Transcendence, switching playbooks, confront the psychic maelstrom, and so forth).<br/><br/>I'm sure that we will continue to find better ways to implement this kind of technology as we develop our craft as designers, but for me, at least, Keys have worked extremely well.<br/><br/>The main advantage for me is the communication/flagging aspect: the players know what kinds of actions they can pursue by indicating their areas of interest with Keys, and the GM can prepare her material based on the Keys. It's an extremely easy and almost foolproof method for preparing scenarios which makes for reliable dramatic play almost effortlessly.<br/><br/>(One unmentioned aspect is that, ideally, all the players at the table are aware of the Keys and take opportunities to play into them. Not just the GM, but everyone. There was a game called "First Quest" which modified Keys to have triggers relevant to other players - for instance, if a character had a Key or Unbroken Honour, there could be a trigger like, "Challenge this character to a duel, gain 1 XP". That kind of thing would be a great way to develop Key technology further, as I hope we will continue to see: encouraging different forms of interaction between the players.)<br/><br/>I can imagine that all this is a question of skill and understanding, as well: I've never played in a bad game with Keys - where people didn't understand what they were for or how to leverage them into exciting play - so maybe I just haven't seen how they can go awry. Maybe you can relate such an incident to us?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451201/#Comment_451201" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-08T18:28:25+00:00" title="February  8, 2016  6:28PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Basketball is a competition.

Just because you are keeping score does not necessarily mean you are competitive (Everyone knows Larry is better than everyone else at basketball, but it's still fun to play, so  people still play basketball with Larry, and still keep track of points, even though they don't really expect to "win"), and just because you can score points doesn't mean you are keeping score (you can play and enjoy basketball by just dribbling, passing, shooting, and not keeping track of points.

I, too, am confused by this, and I've read this thread pretty carefully (including just now going over all your comments about Burning Wheel). If overcoming obstacles qualifies as "competitive", and therefore is an area of play which is not problematic, why do you use terms like "despicable" to refer to Luke Crane's design of Burning Wheel?<br/><br/>I'd say this is an important point of your argument, and a lot hinges on it, since *most* RPGs involve "overcoming obstacles". <br/><br/>On a slightly different topic:<br/><br/>I've been thinking about the power of intermittent rewards recently, since I started a long game of Poker 1-on-1 with my girlfriend. I was down, she had almost all of the chips, and I was almost certain to lose when I bet all I had on a good hand. She felt confident because she also had a good hand, and it was a very tense moment. I won by a very narrow margin, in a very dramatic reversal!<br/><br/>It was very exciting, and it made us both want to play a lot more. However, since then I started noticing just how *little* fun we were having the rest of the time. While that moment (and others like it) were fun and dramatic, most hands dealt ended in very uninteresting ways, with both of us fairly bored. Yes, we had to think and make decisions, and in terms of learning the game, we were enjoying ourselves. But as we learn to play better, it becomes less and less interesting. <br/><br/>Is it just those rare exciting moments which have us hooked? If so, is that another form of "despicable" game design? Have we tricked ourselves into a tedious activity, which we only continue because of occasional dramatic payoffs? <br/><br/>I'm not sure what the answer is, but it seems relevant. (And particularly relevant to certain games I've played in the past.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451306/#Comment_451306" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-12T19:33:24+00:00" title="February 12, 2016  7:33PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul's first point pretty much sums up my opinion on this.
