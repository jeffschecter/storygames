We're trying out story gaming, and we've played two games of Fiasco. Both sessions were fun, and the second session was a definite improvement over the first, but things really seemed to fizzle towards the end of both sessions. We do pretty well with the more setup and color types of scenes, but when it comes time to move things towards a satisfying climax, we've not done well. I already know that part of this is because a couple of the players setup or resolved scenes that pretty much nullified our attempts to steer things in a certain direction (and not in a good way), mainly due to a lack of awareness. We talked about this after the game, and we're going to be more conscious of this next time. Even accounting for that, I could use any advice people might have to help move the story towards a satisfying and awesome conclusion.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416613/#Comment_416613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T19:25:22+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  7:25PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Snowball things, but don't let them get completely out of control, is what I'd say. Also keep in mind the possibilities of any given new scene. See how many characters you can drag into your relationships, and keep hitting them hard. Remember that you're just supposed to jump for what your character wants, instead of building to it. So be bold in your scene framing and intents for the setup. If another player lets y'all set up the scene, that's your chance to put them right on the spot.<br/><br/>Oh, and the Aftermath works great to pick up all those random details and tie them back in. I managed to do that quite skillfully with a three-player game.<br/><br/>And be sure to let things fly by the Aftermath.

In a freeform roleplaying situation (which Fiasco is, very almost), people can be very hesitant to push hard enough, as well as to escalate and resolve conflicts. When we played Fiasco, it was hard to get people to commit to and play through dramatic events: it's easier to avoid them, after all, which means there's no danger of stepping on other people's toes.<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing to hearing (more) advice on this topic!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/samwise" title="samwise"><img alt="samwise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/samwise">samwise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416627/#Comment_416627" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T03:00:50+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  3:00AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            maybe that's not newbie trick, but how about this exercise:<br/><br/>first scene (player narrate): It's my funeral, all of your characters are around my grave..<br/>and go on mostly in reverse chronological order.<br/><br/>It should be quite rewarding, thought challenging.

It sounds like you guys are doing fine. You're playing in a different way and using different muscles and getting better at it. It won't always be 100% gold! Listening and reincorporating are skills you can build through play, so play a lot...<br/><br/>Here's a big laundry list of advice from John Stavropoulos, some of which surely applies to your situation:<br/><br/><b>Be Generous</b><br/>Listen and share: Generosity means giving freely, sharing, and accepting what others share in return. Be patient and kind. <br/><br/>Listen intently, all the time.<br/>Find the group\u2019s vibe and go along with it. Listen more than you talk.<br/><br/>Incorporate and reincorporate others\u2019 ideas. Reduce, reuse and recycle the fiction.<br/>Think of yourself as a conservator of other people\u2019s genius. Using someone else\u2019s idea is a wonderful gift to them.<br/><br/>Offer ideas when necessary or appropriate<br/>Even a conservator needs to bust out and paint something occasionally, to stay fresh and keep their skills up. Your contribution is a gift to other players looking for things to reincorporate themselves.<br/><br/>Grab the spotlight when appropriate, but shine it elsewhere more often<br/>This is the performative adjunct to \u201clisten more than you talk:\u201d - balance attention generously and gracefully. Happily give the gift of your interest and enthusiasm.<br/><br/><br/><b>Plot and Scheme</b><br/>Be interesting and make trouble: As a player you should constantly be looking for opportunities to complicate and challenge, judiciously acting on those opportunities in the service of a better experience for everyone.<br/><br/>Make your character interesting to everyone, including yourself.<br/>Aim to delight. Use humor and pathos, strive for a well-realized and sympathetic character. <br/><br/>Have strong, clear goals and motivations as a player and a character<br/>Know what you want and know what your character wants. If those two things are different, so much the better. <br/><br/>Explicitly and implicitly tie your character to others.<br/>If you have the opportunity to establish existing relationships, dive in - be sisters, be lovers, be rivals. If relationships are fixed, amplify and build and transform. Make it complicated and messy and interesting.<br/><br/>Give your character weaknesses and hooks.<br/>Trust your fellow players to use your vulnerability to make the game (and your character\u2019s life) more fun, by some definition of fun. Characters in safety may not lead interesting lives.<br/><br/>Accept gifts of lower status, adversity and confrontation.<br/>Danger, humiliation and defeat are the finest tokens of esteem one can bestow on a player. That you are worth endangering, humiliating or defeating is the highest praise. Strive to return the favor.<br/><br/>Build, escalate and break patterns.<br/>It is very common to form social patterns, and this is a fundamental play activity. Be aware of the patterns you build, and seek to intensify and ultimately transform them. An obvious example - if you begin with a rival, make them a murderous rival, and then fall in love with them.<br/><br/><br/><b>Embody</b><br/>It\u2019s your game, too: Play it as hard as you can, including on the metagame level where appropriate. <br/><br/>Play transparently and honestly.<br/>Show good judgment. Play fair and play openly. Let people know what you are doing and what you want.<br/><br/>Really sell character personality and emotion. <br/>Play a real character, according to the game\u2019s fiction and theme. Respect genre and premise.<br/><br/>Strongly advocate for your character and the elements you control.<br/>Advocacy does not necessarily mean the relentless pursuit of success. <br/><br/>Allow in-game events to change your character.<br/>Don\u2019t think too far ahead. Be open to the developing fiction\u2019s transformative chaos.<br/><br/>Absorb the rules and use them vigorously.<br/>Rules are there for a reason, so don\u2019t avoid them. Note that \u201crules\u201d exist on the social level, too.<br/><br/>Lose enthusiastically and fail in interesting ways.<br/>If you are given the gift of failure, fail in an ignominious way that makes someone else look good and deepens their relationship with you.<br/><br/><br/><b>Facilitate</b><br/>Even if it isn\u2019t your job, it is your job: Take metagame ownership of the game as it grows and changes.<br/><br/>Shepherd the plot<br/>Keep an eye out for fictional loose ends and tie them together. <br/><br/>Troubleshoot<br/>Identify and help to correct problems wherever they occur, on every level. This includes problems that develop in the fiction, of course, but also social issues between participants.<br/><br/>Be a fan of other players characters and contributions.<br/>Empathize with every character in the game. Support their arcs and gift them with challenges, complications, and reversals.<br/><br/>Respect cause and effect.<br/>Think ahead, too! <br/><br/>Help pace the game. <br/>The very best way to maintain a satisfying pace is to edit judiciously but decisively. End scenes, shift time, and keep things moving. Strive to build a local culture of play that embraces and encourages editing by any player. When you are involved in a scene it can be difficult to see the logical edit point, but an otherwise-unengaged fellow player may spot it easily. If they have social permission to end the scene, so much the better. Strive to build a stable of eager editors! This has the added benefit of keeping everyone involved at all times.<br/><br/><br/><b>Be Safe</b><br/>Keep your priorities straight: Remember that people are more important than the game.<br/><br/>Use space wisely.<br/>Use personal space and volume to communicate appropriately, giving other players the physical and temporal space they need.<br/><br/>Help others with rules and concepts.<br/>Be helpful generally, but particularly as a resource for players either newer or less adept at absorbing procedures than yourself.<br/><br/>Work hard, but encourage occasional breaks.<br/>Come prepared to really invest some effort in making the game great.<br/><br/>Ask for help, suggestions and feedback.<br/>Your idea is probably not the absolute best idea. Your frustration probably isn\u2019t necessary. Feedback - on your own choices and involvement and on the game in general, can be a positive force for improving the experience for everybody.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416630/#Comment_416630" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T04:49:02+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  4:49AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Help pace the game. <br/>The very best way to maintain a satisfying pace is to edit judiciously but decisively.

You might not be doing this, but I've seen a fair number of players new to Fiasco get a bit caught up on 'this thing is happening, so we need to see that thing next' type play. A great way to keep the game moving, which allows you to get to big endings, is to happily presume and jump where possible. Just because someone is injured and needs to go to the hospital doesn't mean the next scene has to be in the hospital, it can be a week later as they walk in to the bar on crutches with a story to tell...<br/><br/>Of course, this might not be a problem you're having, and you do need to be careful not to jump too far ahead if it hurts other plots :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416631/#Comment_416631" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T04:57:16+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  4:57AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what is happening is the natural restraining of behavior that we all have in real life stepping into the game. In reality we don't do crazy things that will end in self destruction (well we do but not as dramatically). If that is brought into games - people stop short of jumping over the cliff. I do this myself.<br/><br/>When I read the post I though - High Ambition - Poor Impulse Control. If the set up if you drive you own metaphorical car towards the edge of the cliff at top speed, certain that you will reach the other side of the Grand Canyon, then there will be a dramatic ending. Ignore all indications you should slow down, double down when any hazard signs show up, shoot for the top even when you are heading straight for a wall (because the wall won't stop you!) And the end will be amazing. There will be a splat.<br/><br/>When players see an example of totally letting go of restraint they should be able to do it for themselves. It helps to run a character who is totally clueless. "You know you want me baby. No means yes." It will be politically incorrect and fun.<br/><br/>I'll remind myself this the next time I play. I'm such a problem solver which is a kill joy. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416636/#Comment_416636" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T07:58:04+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  7:58AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            THE NEED                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416637/#Comment_416637" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T07:58:32+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  7:58AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>John's list is fantastic!

Of editing out the weaker stuff as you play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416642/#Comment_416642" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T08:29:12+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  8:29AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am fond of saying "...and scene" with a little hand gesture when I play Fiasco in particular and anything more generally, when the action reaches a really strong end point.

What you can do is writing 4-5 things that you need to think of, like escalate, dragging another character into your plans, create a goal, reveal something from the past that creates a twist, getting into someone's way and things like that. Write these things on separate pieces of paper that you place on the table and pass a talking stick (a miniature or something) along while you're playing. The person with the talking stick starts the turn with placing the "stick" on one of the pieces of paper and the scene should be created with that in mind.<br/><br/>The player with the stick can end the scene by taking the stick from the paper and hand it to the next player. You probably don't need this when you get more experienced, but it's a nice hand-holding mechanism that explains the play style.<br/><br/>I have no idea if this would work though, because I just dragged this idea out of my ass. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenophone" title="xenophone"><img alt="xenophone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenophone">xenophone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416673/#Comment_416673" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T15:20:30+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  3:20PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think what is happening is the natural restraining of behavior that we all have in real life stepping into the game.

Picking a playset and setting up the game is fun but when we're about to begin it can feel like we're taking off on a road trip and maybe didn't pack everything. Time is super short - you only have a few scenes to cram all this potential into. Then you're looking around the table during a scene, trying to figure out which die to give. And do you keep it or give it away? Check the rules. Finally we're just getting a sense of the shape of this thing and we roll on a table that sends us off in a direction that may or may not make sense to where we were figuring this might go. Huh. Often it didn't feel as gratifying as I imagined but... it was still enjoyable. Why is that?<br/><br/>A few thoughts:<br/><br/>John Stavropoulos' list is amazing but dang, that's a lot, too much to remember much less incorporate at the table in a meaningful way. I've been playing RPGs a long time, story games for the past five or six years, studying, teaching and performing improv... and I'm still just getting the hang of some of that stuff. It's sophisticated and heady territory, especially for new players trying to figure out how to set up a scene for another player and how to give dice. So be patient and pick a couple of things that appeal and practice those. The rest may follow in time.<br/><br/>Fiasco emulates movies. And we have a pretty deep-rooted history with and set of expectations of movies. Yet remember that movies aren't crafted using RPG tools: teams of writers and producers and directors and musicians and lighting/special effects folks and a bunch of other people I don't know spend weeks/months/years making them. So when you play a game of Fiasco, basically improvising a movie, you're very rarely going to have an experience aligned with your expectations of what a movie is going to do for you. But part of what's fun is you can get damned close! Based on all those scenes you've watched and emotions you've felt, your subconscious fills in a hell of a lot of blanks and... whoa. That felt like a movie what we did just there. As you get better at it, more and more scenes hit closer to that mark. And eventually you score a bullseye with a scene and that's magic you'll remember, maybe the rest of your life. But it's still never going to be the produced effect of a full-blown movie so acknowledge that you're doing something related but different and let that be the thing you're doing.<br/><br/>Finally, Fiasco is a demanding game, as much as it is approachable. On a spectrum between the old school RPGs of the '70s and advanced improv theater exercises, I'd place Fiasco closer to the latter (which is why it appeals to improv performers so much, I think). It has a steep but rewarding learning curve. If I were to create a workshop for gamers who wanted to really increase their roleplaying skills, it'd be centered around improv and end with Fiasco. Oh, that's right... <a href="http://www.improvforgamers.com/" rel="nofollow">that already exists</a>.<br/><br/>I love Fiasco because it has a bazillion imaginative playsets, it pushes me super hard to be present, open and connected, and it's a bit of a gamble. But I recommend you go in knowing what you're getting into and understand the rest of your fellow players will be on their own learning curves with all this so, again, be patient.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416788/#Comment_416788" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-21T12:16:22+00:00" title="June 21, 2013 12:16PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve,<br/>  I am pretty well versed with Story Games and even when I played with Story Game pros, this has happened (bumpy roads uneven endings). There are a couple of things that can cause this:<br/>1) Lack of rallying around the central Need(s). Some players don't immediately get that even if the Need is not attached to their character, the Need is still a part of their character's story.<br/>2) Lack of listening, this is a big hurdle for people who are not familiar with Story Games, when players consistently fail to integrate other people's contributions to their scenes, the whole thing loses cohesion and direction.<br/>3) Lack of cooperation, the biggest fails I have seen are around when one player wants to take the story one way and drives towards it while another wants to take the story in a completely different direction and drives towards it. It doesn't cause issues if there is only one driver, but more than one driver derails the whole show.<br/>4) A lack of understanding of how the dice taken/given effects the ending. This can be big when players don't realize that the dice they give gives them a better chance for a happy/bad ending. for instance if you want a character to have a miserable ending, you need to give them a pretty even mix of black and white dice.<br/>5) A lack of playing characters/scenes towards that ending. Even the player who told me how the dice shaped the ending would often set/resolve a scene in the opposite direction the dice were headed.<br/><br/>  As an example of a game that went well, we were dong the playset with a mythos-inspired submarine trip home. I played the captain, and I played a combination of Zap Brannigan and Strom Thurman (complete with "put this woman in the brig, she is obviously hysterical" when she was the only character that knew what was going on). The Captain was the worst kind of egotistical, blow hard I could portray. Everyone hated him (even me, lol). But I noticed that because I was getting all black dice, I had a shot at a truly happy ending. So I went for it. I just kept making him more and more despicable.  Not evil, or purposefully harmful, just ignorant and arrogant (e.g., his favorite sub-crewman was the cook who died in the first scene and came back as a myhos-style zombie/husk who he continued to command everyone to follow the cooks orders in his absence). And when the end came, it was clear he was the only one to survive the trip home, where he tells a tall tale about how heroic he was which is rewarded by a promotion and a newer, better sub. This was a combination of all the tips above. I used the cook that another player contributed as almost a central figure in the captain's scenes. No one wanted to see the Captain do well, so no one was driving the scene away from the direction I was going and the game play played towards the dice taken/given.<br/>  All of this is not to brag, but to show how on this rare occasion where it all came together, great sessions are born. This should not be the expectation (I haven't' been able to reproduce it since then), but an ideal to shoot for.<br/>Hope this helps.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
