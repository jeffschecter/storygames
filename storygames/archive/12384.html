Instead of the utmost north, we're in Islamic Iberia during its decline. The holy knights take the place of the Knights, and the Christians (who will eventually take over Spain) take the place of the Mistaken.<br/><br/>A member of our Normally Scheduled Group was to be missing for two sessions, and the other 4 of us had played Polaris over two sessions a year ago when he was similarly out of country, so we decided to pick up some TABAW. It didn't go so well. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> After session 2 we discussed a bit to see if we could figure out what to do better next time.<br/><br/>1. Character creation is <i>important</i>. Much more so than for a stately, drawn-out game. See, we were planning to get through the whole cycle in two sessions. To facilitate this we used 2 Protagonists. There wasn't <i>time</i> to find out through play what would end up being important to the knight and Heart... we needed upfront "design" aka well thought-out and communicated characters. Instead, as one of the two Infidels, I spent most of my time with probing challenges to flesh out the Knight. This didn't fit the play structure we had constrained ourselves to - I should instead have just hashed that out right at the beginning.<br/><br/>2. <i>Communicate</i> your theme desires. One of our Hearts was trying to have a "science versus faith" sort of character, but since he didn't communicate this to us (and especially to his Infidel) he ended up having more of a "I really care about clocks and clock-making" character. Could be fine... if everyone was on the same page. We weren't.<br/><br/>3. Figure out how much you can neglect setting verisimilitude and whatnot. Our very different levels of familiarity with e.g. logistics from 1000-1500 caused some pretty big disconnects. Unlike a fantasy setting in the magical North, some people have strong intuitions about how long it takes to wage a campaign across France eventually reaching Rome itself. And asking them to discard those intuitions does not turn out to be cost-free.<br/><br/>4. [theorycraft] Use the culture clash at home a lot. We didn't - instead we had the tides of raiding/wars between the Muslims and the Infidels, and the inter-Muslim politics of Valencia as our major backdrops. After the fact, and reviewing the text, it seems there's a lot more space for the sort of game I at least wanted to play in the interplay between the social classes at home.<br/><br/>5. As Infidel, especially in a shortish game, do the following over and over (or at least more than once): And Furthermore something tragic with the intent to draw a You Ask Far Too Much and then ask an orthogonal tragedy. Lucking into it is all right, but you've really got to think on your feet to hit a good second option. Instead when you have this great idea, don't And Furthermore it - think of a second thing and And Furthermore <i>that</i>.<br/><br/>That said, I wouldn't <i>discourage</i> anyone from picking up TABAW! I think it's probably great, and I really like the "only use the supernatural wackiness if you expend a theme" idea. But if you're not going to spend a lot of time with it, be extra sure to start focused and communicate well, since you won't have nearly as much luxury of letting that emerge through play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277900/#Comment_277900" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T13:30:46+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  1:30PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guy - <br/><br/>Thanks for your comments. I have experienced some of the frustrations that you are talking about when trying to play the 2 Hearts/2 Infidels variant. Over the past year, I have come to the conclusion that this ruleset just doesn't work for TABAW, although it might work just fine for Polaris. (I don't know, I've never tried it with Polaris. I have tried it a bunch of times with TABAW.) This is one of the biggest reasons I'm working on a revised edition. I can't stop people from using this variant, because people are always going to hack something to make it a one-shot, but I'm putting in very strong warnings about playing this way. The story is very satisfying when allowed to unfold at its natural pace. It is not at all satisfying when it is shoe-horned into a short period of time. I will make sure to state this as emphatically and as often as possible.<br/><br/>As for the rest, it seems like your group wasn't on the same page as to expectations, and I'm sorry for that. It seems like that is something I need to make clear in the new edition - that in addition to creating characters people should also talk about what aspects of the setting they're interested in engaging in. It's a big setting - I wanted to give people lots of room to play. If you want to play a game focused on the battles with the Christians that features relationships back home as a minor recurring theme, that's okay. If you want to play it with relationships at home and the battles as a minor recurring theme, that's okay too. There's no wrong way to play, as long as everyone is on board with wanting the same thing.<br/><br/>Also, don't get hung up on realism too much. If the timing of major troop movements bothers you, just handwave through the boring parts. The nice thing about Polaris is that you can be very flexible with time. It is totally acceptable to open a scene and say 'six months has passed. the Christians are now on your doorstep', or whatever your group finds feasible. The temptation to get caught up in realism is tempting, but do try to resist it when needed to move the story along. After all, race riots where Christians, Jews, and Moors banded together to slaughter all the Arabs in the city aren't really historically accurate either. But they're something interesting that could happen in your world if you decide that interests you.<br/><br/>Number Five: YES. I am writing this into the revised advice section, because this is one of my favorite tricks ever and I think it needs to be stated clearly as an option for people who are a bit uncertain as to how best to provide antagonism. My absolute favorite thing in the world is tricking Hearts into using You Ask Far Too Much, because then you can sucker punch them with something EVEN WORSE. Oh, you don't want to be found guilty of murdering the emir? Well, your lover is actually your sister. BOOM. ...anyway. You Ask Far Too Much is definitely the best tool in the Infidel's tool basket, hands down.<br/><br/>I do hope that you and group will consider playing again when you have a bit more time to play at a leisurely pace. It's not a long game - I'd be shocked if it went more than four sessions. I've only ever heard of one group playing one that lasted five. And if your group has any questions, feel free to email me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277916/#Comment_277916" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T14:31:44+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  2:31PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>I have experienced some of the frustrations that you are talking about when trying to play the 2 Hearts/2 Infidels variant.
