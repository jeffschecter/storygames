In any case, I need your suggestions for psychological thrillers (preferably, though not necessarily, with a supernatural bent). There's a few specific varieties I'm looking for and the one thread that binds them all together is isolation. The main characters should be separated from the rest of humanity by distance or some other means. Here are the types I'm thinking about:<br/><br/><b>TRAPPED IN A HOUSE</b><br/>- The Haunting (1963) / "The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson (this is the book/movie combo that got me thinking of the whole idea, so if you can think of anything close to this, I'm all ears)<br/>- The Shining (book or movie)<br/>- "Curse of the Yellow Sign: Act II" by John Wick<br/><br/><b>TRAPPED IN A VILLAGE</b><br/>- "The Shadow Over Innsmouth" by HP Lovecraft<br/>- "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" by Shirley Jackson<br/>- The Wicker Man (1973)<br/><br/><b>TRAPPED IN SOME OTHER KIND OF RURAL SETTING (THE WOODS, A CABIN)</b><br/>- Deliverance<br/>- The Blair Witch Project<br/><br/>If you want to get REALLY specific, what I'm looking for are suggestions where the psychologically creepy elements of the setting serve to reflect and amplify the emotional turmoil of the people trapped in them. So, more like The Haunting or Blair Witch (where you never see the supernatural elements) than Evil Dead (which, just for the record, I love to death).<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328346/#Comment_328346" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T18:50:12+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  6:50PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2011 8:18AM by lordgoon.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Lord of the Flies</i> certainly fits the model.

Its like mixing Doctor Who, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and MI-5.<br/>If you <i>don't</i> like the new Doctor Who series...well, maybe just check out "Countrycide" and a few other season 1 episodes to see if it fits your tastes.<br/><br/>Been thinking about some other examples...I seem to recall a few Japanese horror movies and tv shows that might fit the bill.<br/><i>Shikoku</i>, I think, was one of them. Maybe not the best film (since it largely played off the popularity of <i>Ringu</i>, back in the day), but I remember enjoying it. I should probably watch it again, if I can find my VHS of it.<br/>Nighthead (either the poor SFX-laden original TV series, or the overdramatic anime series) would be an example of "trapped in a city."  Psychic brothers trying to escape the clutches of an institute (that, honestly, really had their best interests at heart), while solving mysteries and stopping renegade psychics they ran across. Now, I should note that even though they had relative freedom within Tokyo, they were functionally "trapped" because their powers made them literally "weirdness magnets," and the younger brother had severe mental problems that made travel difficult. Along similar lines was <i>Sci-Fi Harry</i>...which I don't think ever made it State-side.<br/><br/>Oh, and how about <i>Avalon </i>(I think that was from Mamoru Oshii), for trapped in a virtual world?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dgreen1220" title="Dgreen1220"><img alt="Dgreen1220" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dgreen1220">Dgreen1220</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329459/#Comment_329459" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T14:34:13+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  2:34PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2011 2:36PM by Dgreen1220.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Running on the "psychologically creepy elements of the setting serve to reflect and amplify the emotional turmoil of the people trapped in them" vein I would recommend, and this might seem sorta odd, but the Persona 3 &amp; 4 games for PS2. Both of these games involve the characters having assess to a strange sort of parallel dimension that is a sort of twisted image of their inner conflicts. Especially in 4 where each character has to confront their "shadow" and come to grips with less than pleasant elements of themselves. Two-thirds Buffy and one Third Silent Hill, but you could easily re-adjust that ratio. In three this place is actually a time, "The Dark Hour" in which after the clock strikes midnight the whole world sorta slips into stasis and only the hero and the creatures that inhabit that world can move about or act. Everything else freezes solid and all the people are replaced by coffins(?!). Strangely enough I don't think the image of the clock striking 13 is ever used...<br/>\n<br/>\nInsert randomness: This isn't a new idea of mine. Here's a blub I noted to myself once as an attempt to encapsulate this idea:<br/>\nThe Deserted Streets: Players are regular folks who find themselves experiencing extreme bouts of insomnia. As exhaustion sets in they begin finding parts of their city they've never found before. Street lead into stranger and stranger parts of town until the players find themselves amid a forest of abandoned hexagonal sky scrapers and abandoned streets covered in fine blowing black sand. Doorways with myriad locks of different makes cover the walls and at the bizarre bazaar keys are the currency of choice (though strange triangular coins are required for the most exotic items) As the players explore this sand-box world of modular tiles they find that certain patterns (North, East, South, East) can be used to take them to specific locations. The Shrines of the four directions, wandering parties on pilgrimage, empty husks of buildings, and veiled traders are just some of the random encounters. Sleep brings you back to the "real world." Are you crazy? Delusional? if so why do you have so many, many keys under your bed...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
