One of the reasons people love combat in RPG is the sense of tension during an ongoing fight. Each time you roll, you don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ll hit or not; you don\u2019t know how much damage you\u2019ll make, or how much damage you\u2019ll take. Etc, etc. Part of the fun too is that there seem to be so many tactical options on what you can do.<br/><br/>It seems that a few game systems attempt to do something similar with social conflict. Second hand descriptions of Burning Wheel\u2019s Duel of Wits come to mind, as well as as descriptions of how the Monkey (The-Storytelling-Game-of-the-Journey-to-the-West) handles \u201csoft\u201d conflicts via three strikes (much less tactical than combat, though). <br/><br/>I\u2019ve been wondering if there might there be a way to represent the struggle of the internal conflict in a like manner, somehow staging it moment by moment as you would in combat.  <br/><br/>I\u2019ve considered converting internal neuroses or flaws into metaphorical monsters with stats, including hit points? If they defeat you, you succumb to your flaw. If you defeat them, you don\u2019t succumb to them at least at that juncture (that also leads me to the other question of when can a character completely overcome them forever, but I haven\u2019t thought that through either).  <br/><br/>To me, a metaphorical monster sounds interesting on paper, but I have a feeling it might make the struggle feel like less like an internal struggle, even if you know it\u2019s just a metaphor. Maybe each time your PC gets \u2018hit\u2019, something happens outside to represent that. If your PC has a heroin addiction, and is being tempted by a friend, maybe getting \u2018hit\u2019 means that he starts counting how much money he has on, getting hit again means he starts walking with his friend towards the dope dealer\u2019s place. Hitting the monster, maybe means that he stops and starts rationalizing why maybe he shouldn\u2019t, etc. When you defeat the monster, it means you\u2019ve overcome it (if only for the time being); when it defeats you, it means you succumb to your flaw or problem this time.<br/><br/>Might there be other/better ways of representing internal conflicts so as to create tension the way that combat does?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425717/#Comment_425717" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-12T09:28:17+00:00" title="December 12, 2013  9:28AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "metaphysical monster" angle seems a bit overwrought, and doesn't seem to do much for the gameplay.

I think there's some risk involved in externalizing the moral conflicts of the player character, in that they'll become disconnected from the emotional aspect of roleplaying, but it's an interesting idea.<br/><br/>An interesting game using the same "A Dirty World" mechanics is "Better Angels", where you play a human who is empowered by a demon, the human's goal is to use the demon's power without being too corrupted or harming too many people, while the demon, controlled by the GM, wants just the opposite.  It would be interesting to compare and contrast this with the similarly themed Sorcerer, which explicitly doesn't use rules to model internal conflicts, except for the Humanity rating which is more a marker of what that character has done.  <br/><br/>*for some values of wrong                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425765/#Comment_425765" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-13T11:39:08+00:00" title="December 13, 2013 11:39AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2013 11:59AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>The "metaphysical monster" angle seems a bit overwrought, and doesn't seem to do much for the gameplay.

This works far better in, say, a one-on-one game (ooh! ADW would be great for a one-on-one game!) than in a group game. But here's how I'd do it...<br/><br/>I would look at the surrounding circumstances, and see the Qualities as either weak points where the character might cave or bastions of strength that they can draw on. We'd alternate actions, and my actions would describe a thought or mentality that attacks one of the character's Qualities, putting it down. <i>e.g., "Your thoughts turn to the wretched state that you've been reduced to by your murky actions. I'm rolling 6 dice to attack your Purity." or "This one's for you, and nobody else. It's about time you did something for you. I'm rolling 6 dice to attack your Generosity."</i> (Actually, I might be tempted to use the player's own stats as the GM roll. So it'd be something like "I'm rolling your Persuasive Corruption to attack your Purity." Dang, with quality sliding, that'd be <b>awesome</b>!)<br/><br/>The player would oppose my roll with a roll of their own, such as "Part of me wants to do it, but I know that once I start, I can't turn back. I'm rolling Understanding Honesty to defend." Then, after the roll, they'd flip it around and go on the offensive, trying to knock down a generic "Temptation" number. Come to think of it, the GM's pool is probably Temptation + the most appropriate character stat.<br/><br/>Okay, that could be seriously cool, actually. My interest in this game (which I had previously shelved) has perked up.<br/><br/>By the way, Greg Stolze has put out <a href="http://www.gregstolze.com/adirtyworld/ADWCharSheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">a cheat sheet PDF</a> that explains the Qualities.
