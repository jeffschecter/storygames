You could replace this with something else... ...maybe western zodiac (which I find kinda lame), or maybe something cooler, like maybe Army, Navy, Airforce, and so on (or nationality, if it's a joint operation, there were Australians, New Zealanders, and all kinds of other small groups represented) Each has an allied and an enemy service.<br/><br/>The Abilities: You'll need to reword these a little.  Maybe equipment would fill the same role.  It needs to be something that gives the character the ability to do something the others can't - not just makes them better at something.  <br/><br/>The Questions:  It's important to the game that the characters reveal something of their past, and that it tie into the reasons they're taking the mission.  That's hard in a game where people are being sent on a mission - they being ordered, rather than being paid, which I think is a big difference.  I don't have a lot of suggestions here.<br/><br/>Maybe it would help to think about how you want to relate the issues of The Mountain Witch to Heart of Darkness.  The Mountain Witch is about trust and honour, while Heart of Darkness is kind of about "civilization" and "savagery".  I can see some parallells, like, that one of the things that keeps civilization together is mutual trust, and without it, we'd have chaos.  Apocalypse Now is kind of about similar issues, but it's more about how war creates a moral vaccuum.  I'm not sure how to relate that to The Mountain Witch as much.<br/><br/>Good luck with this project, and let us know how it goes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146004/#Comment_146004" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T06:10:38+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  6:10AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really great idea.

Abilities would just be about making sure they are setting appropriate. My main concern would be wording the cards correctly. The Mountain Witch really rests on those cards for driving play. Also in addition to asking why are you going up the river, you may also want to ask why you are in the War.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146778/#Comment_146778" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T22:25:49+00:00" title="May 29, 2008 10:25PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So maybe the Witch is ex-MACV SOG who refused to come in from the jungle and is now running his own ops across the border with his faithful Montagnards, and supplying himself via the drug trade with corrupt officials or even the CIA and Air America.  The Yards think he's magic because of the number of enemies he's killed, and maybe he is.  Definitely it needs to be across the border.<br/><br/>Maybe the backup plan is to call in Arclight and carpet bomb the whole place with B-52's, but if the PCs can get him and call it off, they'll at least save the villagers.  Right.<br/><br/>I think the South Koreans had some troops in country.  Scary, scary ROK troops.<br/><br/>Stuart Herrington wrote a book called <em>Silence was a Weapon</em> in 1982 that's in print now as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stalking-Vietcong-Operation-Phoenix-Personal/dp/0345472519/" rel="nofollow"><em>Stalking the Vietcong: Inside Operation Phoenix: A Personal Account</em></a>.  You probably wouldn't have time to read it before your game, but I'll bring along a copy if you want to take a look.<br/><br/>You can ignore Zodiac easily enough.  There'll be trust issues galore if its a joint operation with, let's see, Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force (to call in air, or call them off), ARVN, and Company **** (CIA).  Hopefully the spook takes "Eyes in the back of his head" as one of his abilities.<br/><br/>Sounds fun; good luck with it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146780/#Comment_146780" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T22:29:42+00:00" title="May 29, 2008 10:29PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, John Harper should totally bring his ex-LRRP airsofters to crash Chris' game.<br/><br/>Back in the 80's I once ran a short Morrow Project campaign in which the recon team was played by veterans,<br/>and their nightly camping technique was a big contrast to the more typical "We put a guy on watch and go<br/>to sleep."
