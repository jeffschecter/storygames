It better be pivotal.  Ultimately the player has the right to call it, but if he calls it over something trivial he's going to get cheetos thrown at him.    So it's more detailed resolution, but it isn't complex or difficult - it just takes longer than a single roll to resolve something.  <br/><br/>Tracking harm is honestly no big deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95579/#Comment_95579" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T14:26:58+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  2:26PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (1) Far, far, far less than games like D&amp;D and Burning Wheel.

Since the system's numerical range is effectively capped from 0 to 7, and practically from 0 to 6, you can really do any of the maths in your head. The fudge/bonus/penalty dice mechanics also lead to two small number additions or subtractions and a comparison of these results in some cases. Sometimes, Weapons and Armor lead to another factor being added in. <br/><br/>The work in all this is in the open phase, where you discuss who does what, and in managing the characters' intentions. But even that gets easier once you realize giving a conflict and coming back for a new goal later can be a superior strategy in comparison with changing intent in mid-conflict.<br/><br/>Tracking Harm is easier than it looks, it's only one track with six fields, where gaps close after each BDTP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96830/#Comment_96830" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T06:43:45+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  6:43AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Question about the gap closing after BDTP: the rules for healing seem to state that a failed first aid, herbalism, et. al. roll will result in the gaps not closing.

Maybe you could advise me if I was doing something wrong?<br/><br/>As I understand it, the GM creates a number of Key Scenes, like "Tesha returns to her demonic family to find out her mother is planning on selling her hand in marriage to the highest bidder", or "Typhon's mentor at the arena asks him to throw a match". When these scenes come into play, the PCs each earn some XP.<br/><br/>In our game, this never worked out as being anything other than - essentially - XP for turning up. The players played. Every few scenes they got XP. But I don't feel they were guiding my GMing at all, and the really good scenes weren't necessarily the Key Scenes, they were the ones where a player hit the major condition of one of their Keys. We switched to a system where when someone achieved that major condition, every other PC earned an XP too, which encourages people to arrange fruitful situations for each other.<br/><br/>Have I just misunderstood how Key Scenes work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97097/#Comment_97097" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T06:49:49+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  6:49AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the clarification on healing.

I had been thinking that Simple Opposed Ability Checks dealt Harm, like, "I defeat you in Sword Combat!" with say, 2 success levels, would deal harm in the 2 slot. And that the big danger with BDtP was in getting possibly <i>more</i> harm, like filling in 4 slots instead of 1.<br/><br/>But I was reading today and realized that according to the book, you deal harm ONLY in BDtP, and Simple Checks simply resolve intent, whatever that may be. Like I said, Duh! I'm sure I'm the only person here who didn't realize that before. =\\<br/><br/>So anyway, that set me a-wonderin', what are simple checks going to look like in actual gameplay? I'm thinking here of combat-related checks; simple feats of skill or acts of persuasion, and such, are pretty clear. But for Martial activities, I'm having a hard time imagining their resolution. Scale of action is one bugaboo--as the text indicates, your Intent can be anything from "drive him to his knees with a sword blow" to "kill 'im." So you can play out a combat all incremental, like "drive him back, disarm him, bring him to his knees, deliver the killing blow." or you can just go "kill!" and have it over and done with. I'm wondering what reason there is to choose the former over the latter? for the SG, there's Clinton's advice above to go easy on the death, but for PCs, they're gonna be all like, "kill," right?<br/><br/>Also, if you resolve an intent to, say, wound someone, but don't Bring Down the Pain, then if you're successful. . .they're wounded? But with no Harm? No impairment to their functioning or need to heal? How does that work out in actual practice? Do people just go through the motions of characters being injured and needing treatment/rest, or what?<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm just being too fussy. But I plan to play TSoY soon and I wanted to clear up the nagging questions.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97317/#Comment_97317" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T16:04:54+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  4:04PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2007 4:07PM by oliof.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal take: Sometimes you don't want to kill.

As you choose an ability for a check or conflict, you just state what kind of action will be instrumental in achieving intent.<br/><br/>Regarding Harm as the result of simple conflicts: Your intent can be "I want to break him with my staggering blows." or "I want to hobble him by cutting his achilles heel" and I as SG would interpret that as your opponent getting a broken result on his harm tracker if you succeed against him. This isn't in the book explicitly, but as the SG can set harm as the result of a failed ability check, why not do it in combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97320/#Comment_97320" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T16:13:36+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  4:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Page 85 explains how to get harmed outside of BDTP.

My frettings above are just the product of a beleaguered gamemaster whose players seem to always go for the literal jugular--even playing bewildered tourists in an urban intrigue game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>Page 85 explains how to get harmed outside of BDTP. It can be added to stakes, like most anything.</blockquote>\nAh, I shoulda known I was missing something. Thanks. I find it interesting that the example ("if you lose you'll take level 5 Harm in Instinct and be banned from the kingdom") is not tied to success level--it's Level 5 no matter what. But  guess this is variable; you can set the stake to taste.

We use Harm as part of stakes often in our game, as a way of giving mechanical punch to narration details.  I've been pushing this issue especially hard in our current game, where my character has Key of the Masochist (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22002.msg224427" rel="nofollow">Ricky Donato style</a>).  In pretty much every scene I'm angling for stakes where I can net some Harm out of the results, even if I win.  "I'm trying to help the old man who's dangling from the ledge of the building, which means I'm ignoring the two thugs behind me with bats.  If I lose they break me with a rain of blows, but if I win, I only get bloodied and I save the oldster!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
