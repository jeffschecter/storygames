I've been reading Sorcerer lately and so I'm interested in how particular fictional effects get built out of the demon powers in real play (and I don't know of any bigger fans of sorcerer than you and CK...)</blockquote>\nSure!  Though you might be disappointed by the answer.<br/><br/>The "Death Touch" is just the Special Lethal Damage ability.  My demon is an Inconspicuous and that ability confers to me which simply means as long as the demon keeps the power on I can choose to use it how and when I like.<br/><br/>Now some details:<br/><br/>Special Lethal Damage is a very misunderstood ability.  The *lethal* in it's name is not fucking around.  This is not a 1d6 extra damage per round, this is a finishing move.  If you get hit the fight will be OVER except when used by either a very small demon or on a very badass opponent.<br/><br/>Now, my demon, Moravia the Goddess of Death, is a Power 10 demon.  That means that I'm dealing a MINIMUM of 11 lasting penalties on a single strike.  Considering the average Stamina of an everyday person is around 3 that's almost 4 times that.  So even after halving the penalties after a fight there's a good chance they'll still be above 2x their Stamina.<br/><br/>So, I feel pretty justified in my description of the power.  If I touch you, you just die.  Now obviously that isn't counting powerful demons, other Sorcerers, really bad ass NPCs and so on.  But in the source material we see sorcerers killing people with their stare all the time only to have some other character overcome it with shear will power later and the mechanics are there to back that up.  I'm cool with that.  But in general if I touch you, you're dust.<br/><br/>Was that the kind of answer you were looking for?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332368/#Comment_332368" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T20:02:19+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  8:02PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was, and that was more or less what I expected (though I wasn't sure what Power level of demon you were wielding).

So in theory something might function as a Death Touch even if it's just a pretty wimpy attack.  The only issue is whether it would also function as a Death Touch for Named NPC's.<br/>\n<br/>\nJesse, out of curiosity, how much Power do you give most of your demons?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how would you build a demon that represents the agony of eternal loneliness?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332499/#Comment_332499" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T10:56:59+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 10:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2011 11:21AM by Jesse.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey James,<br><br>Yes, there's a one hit rule in the book.  So yeah, even if I were dealing with a lower Power demon it's perfectly fair to still have a Death Touch if that's how you thought about the power.<br><br>This demon is unusually powerful largely because I had to double up on a lot of the abilities because I wanted her and I to be able to act side by side and do a lot of the same things.  In general though the magic number seems to be Power 6.  The standard range is from about 4 to 8 but exactly 6 turns up with quite a lot of regularity.<br/><br/>Demon: Agony of Eternal Loneliness<br/>Telltale: It is always cold in its presence.<br/>Type: Inconspicuous<br/><br/>Stamina: 4<br/>Will: 5<br/>Lore: 4<br/>Power: 5<br/><br/>Desire: Power<br/>Need: To drink tears<br/><br/>Abilities: Daze (used to make others not notice the subject of its torment), Taint, Confuse (manifests as a hesitancy to act in critical moments), Shadow (man it's gloomy here)<br/><br/>A note about this demon: An odd trap to fall into with Sorcerer is to remember that it's not a game about being haunted.  I've made this mistake, myself, a lot.  The game doesn't work if the Sorcerer isn't getting anything out of having his demon because the game stops being about "how do I use this to get what I want" and turns into a game about getting rid of the demon which turns out to actually be rather easy if you really put your mind to it.  <br/><br/>So I'll create a Sorcerer too who might actually put the Agony of Eternal Loneliness to good use... well A use.<br/><br/>Sorcerer: Abigail Winters, Age 15<br/>Telltale: She has a birthmark on her neck she works hard to keep covered.<br/><br/>Stamina: 3 Just Healthy<br/>Will: 5 Manipulative + Zest for Life<br/>Lore: 2 Coven<br/>Cover: 5 High School Prima Donna<br/><br/>Humanity: 5<br/><br/>Origin: Everybody wants to be Abigail's friend.  In fact they say that if you're NOT Abigail's friend then you might as well not exist.  It's as if anyone who gets on her bad side just... ceases to matter.<br/><br/>Kicker: Abigail has just found out that handsome James Mitchell has asked "Nerdy" Nancy out on a date.

That's a Humanity roll, of course, but it's one penalized by the Humanity score of your victim.<br/><br/>So, young apprentice.  It's in your best interest to sacrifice someone with very low Humanity.  Happen to know anyone like that?  Someone who's burned through a lot of Humanity from dealing with Demons?  Someone like your master, perhaps?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333235/#Comment_333235" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T16:00:48+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  4:00PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 4:22PM by Jesse.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Roger,<br/><br/>Actually, that really isn't going to work.  First of all you get the Humanity of your sacrifice as bonus dice.  So the lower the Humanity of the sacrifice the less worth it, it becomes.  Compound that with the fact that I believe the books say somewhere that animals are considered to have a Humanity score of 1 or 2 and so the trouble of killing a low Humanity human doesn't out weigh the convenience of sacrificing a bunny, chicken or other animal offering.<br/><br/>Personally, I've always found the drug rules for Contacting and the Sacrificing rules for Summoning a little troublesome because sometimes they screw with a particular flavor of Sorcery.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>Edited Note: Oops.  I just did a search in The Forge archives on this topic.  Apparently you add the victim's Stamina or Will as bonus to the ritual, not his Humanity (I think I'm mixing up the Necromancy rules from Sorcerer &amp; Sword).  So yes, your idea would work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
