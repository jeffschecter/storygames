The game is about a journey to a lost continent with Chinese and Japanese folklore stylings. Its focus is on collaborative storytelling and it provides mechanics to push the game in interesting directions. For example, the game relies on each of the players assuming an important role (the Scholar, Warrior, Mystic, Navigator, or Healer). Each role is integral to the journey so the group is penalized in various ways if some of the members are separated from them. This means they have to work together to succeed, but everyone also has an ulterior motive for joining the journey that will likely force them to go against the others at some point. <br/><br/>This release is geared specifically towards gathering playtest information which means it has been stripped of some content so that you can get right into the thick of it and start playing and then, hopefully, provide feedback after a quick session or two. If you provide me with a playtest report, I will gladly credit you and your group, should you wish it, in the final version of the game once I have completed it. <br/><br/>You can get the release at my site <a href="http://bit.ly/wEUt6t" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I would appreciate it very much if you could send me a playtest report either here or through my email at static.veil@gmail.com If you have any questions or comments about the game, feel free to ask away, as well.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>-Daniel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360815/#Comment_360815" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T12:12:45+00:00" title="February 20, 2012 12:12PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks very cool.

Do I throw interesting conflicts at the players? Do I decide what the deal with Otugari is and the players are supposed to find out? Is it "make it up from whole cloth as you go along"?<br/><br/>Understand, I'm pressing because I'm super interested, but not sure I can run it as-is. I get that you want to make a framework that each group can make their own story of Otugari around, but I'm not seeing enough of a frame (for me).<br/><br/>Is "The Journey" heading a fictional account of play, or a road-map for the Narrator, or...?<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for putting this out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable" title="wicked.fable"><img alt="wicked.fable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/614786/Avatar_48x50.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable">wicked.fable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360841/#Comment_360841" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T12:44:19+00:00" title="February 20, 2012 12:44PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Sam">@Sam</a>!: Thanks! I'm glad it looks good. I just threw it together yesterday so it's not as nice as it could be. The design of the final version will be much different from this one.<br/><br/>The game definitely works well for one-and-done play. In fact, that's mostly what I had in mind as I designed it. The details as to what I feel is the best way to end the game are left out as I felt the playtest version should be more flexible, however, it is certainly more geared towards short-term gaming. You should be able to run the game over one session as the details of the "Journey" are left to be decided by the Narrator.<br/><br/>I hope you do get the chance to give it a go. I am also open to hearing about what you think about it even from just the standpoint of reading the text.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Hans">@Hans</a> c-o: That's a very good observation and I admit I probably should have stuffed a larger portion of the Narrator content into the playtest release. As a Narrator, you should prepare an adventure beforehand - make up the plot points and the conflicts the players may have to deal with. The final version of the game will have a more fully-fleshed out guideline for the Journey, but it will definitely be meant as just that, a guideline. In God-king, the Narrator is encouraged to come up with his own interpretation of what the adventure involves.  The material provided is more of a prompt than anything else - you should think of what kind of story it inspires you to tell and then go ahead and tell that story by presenting it to your players. <br/><br/>I hope that helps a bit. If you would like further explanation, please let me know. I am very interested in hearing about what you have to say about the game. I will do my best to help you with anything you need to know about the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360844/#Comment_360844" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T12:49:03+00:00" title="February 20, 2012 12:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, cool.

Though, like Hans, I have a few questions about how it's intended to be used.<br/><br/>I assume you've read and played <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, huh? The games feel really similar, though I honestly prefer the short-and-sweet text you have here to the lengthy explanations and overly detailed resolution (with more complex levels of success) of <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, which is a game that, in my mind, could easily be presented in 20 pages or so.  Also, with <i>The Mountain Witch</i> being out of print (due to the decision of the author), there's definitely room for another game operating in roughly the same space.<br/><br/>My biggest concern, starting out, is the super lengthy opening description of events on pages 10-11, which read like a series of cut-scenes rather than events that the players can actually play through.  I'd much prefer either just a simple starting situation like "You land on the beach; this is what you see" or just cutting to meeting the princess and her presenting the group with some choices.  This lengthy description reads like I (as the GM) am supposed to railroad the players through the early events of play and that their choices don't matter at all.<br/><br/>On the other hand, your description of the various locations and inhabitants of the lost land are evocative enough and just the right length and level of detail.  As GM, I can take those descriptions and run with them, rather feeling trapped like I do with the opening description.  Any chance you can just describe the beach, the longhouse, and what not in the same terms, freeing up the players to actually play through the early events and make meaningful choices?<br/><br/>Also, like Hans, I'd like to know more about what my job is as GM.  How should I push the players so that the game ends with a giant bloodbath of recriminations like <i>The Mountain Witch</i> does?  Without a central focus (like the witch), it's a bit more difficult, though it seems like things will come to a head around a few interactions, such as the players deciding to re-board the ships and return to their homeland.  I'm a bit worried, though, that the betrayals might come earlier on and then the person doing the betraying won't actually die or achieve their ends, leaving them in a kind of in-between place, no longer welcome in the "party" but also unresolved both in their goals and in their existence, lingering around but with little real agency.  I'd have to play it, of course, to know if this concern would actually be an issue.<br/><br/>Finally, the only other question I have is about when to engage the resolution mechanics.  Surely the example of "lifting a heavy rock" is a bit spurious unless lifting that rock is somehow important to the game.  Otherwise, why not just lift it?  Sure, GMs could just use a "common sense" approach, but it'd be nice to know a bit more about what the game is supposed to be about and, thus, when engaging the mechanics is appropriate and when it's a distraction from the core game experience.<br/><br/>All in all, though, very cool and I look forward to seeing how it progresses and maybe giving it a shot at some point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable" title="wicked.fable"><img alt="wicked.fable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/614786/Avatar_48x50.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable">wicked.fable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360909/#Comment_360909" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T16:45:40+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  4:45PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually haven't played it but I felt pretty horrible when I found out about The Mountain Witch last month. At that point, God-king felt like too much of the same thing. It took a bit for me to decide that, aside from aspects like betrayal and Asian folklore, God-king's influences and goals were different enough for me to continue on with it. I hope that my game can be similar to The Mountain Witch in a good way and not simply seem like a rip-off. <br/><br/>About the opening: I agree and I have been struggling with that part. I want to provide a prompt for the Journey to spark a Narrator's imagination while not feeling like they have to follow it exactly. I will try to rework that section as well as some other content for the Journey to feel a less heavy-handed and forceful.<br/><br/>For betrayals, that is an issue I have been trying to work out. I feel that players will wait until later on in the game to act upon their Truth simply because of the way Conflicts are resolved - one player could be ganged up on by the rest. They will have to wait until the right moment presents itself for them to betray the others successfully. I still need to run more playtests to see whether this will be a common problem, though. This is one of the reasons why I would love to get outside feedback on the game. There are probably a lot of things I did not think of or things that I have not run into in playtests.<br/><br/>I have revised the "Narrating God-king" section to include content that, hopefully, addresses your and Hans concerns. Please let me know if it does. You can redownload the game from the link on my website to get the revisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360933/#Comment_360933" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T18:17:25+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  6:17PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2012 6:19PM by stefoid.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I mean, I picked up your game and saw:<br/><br/>-- group of very different characters only brought together by a shared mission<br/>-- secret goals that are in tension and sometimes mutually exclusive<br/>-- freeform traits that are mostly descriptive, not mechanical<br/>-- simple resolution that has degrees of success<br/>-- PC trust measured and used to improve or impede rolls<br/>-- GM guidelines that allow them to generate obstacles and situations based on specific locales on the journey<br/>-- game ends when the journey is over and PCs achieve their secret goals or not<br/><br/>I mean, it's cool that you came up with this combination independently and some of them clearly follow from each other, but wow.  That's nuts.<br/><br/>Reading over your new GM guidelines, I'll admit to being a bit more confused than before.  Previously, I was expecting that the GM set up situations, but it was up to the players how they would deal with them and the GM would basically follow the players' lead based on where they went and what they did (i.e. that it was intended to be run in a strongly "sandbox" style).  But now, it seems like the GM is supposed to do much more planning, determining specific events and set-pieces before play begins.  If that's true, I guess I'd like more information about how the GM is supposed to do this and how to present them to the players.  I'm used to more GM-planning in games that have a "mission-based" structure (like Mouse Guard, Bliss Stage, etc.), because there are set tasks that the characters have to accomplish, but I didn't get that sense here, initially.<br/><br/>To summarize, I guess, if I'm going to run this for some folks, I want both me and the players to be clear about when the players get to choose what to do and when certain things are set by just agreeing to play the game (like going into the dungeon in D&amp;D or accepting the mission in Mouse Guard).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable" title="wicked.fable"><img alt="wicked.fable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/614786/Avatar_48x50.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable">wicked.fable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361035/#Comment_361035" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T05:20:16+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  5:20AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2012 5:40AM by wicked.fable.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/stefoid">@stefoid</a>: Yes, sir. Though I will definitely be revising that section so it is more clear.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/J">@J</a>. Walton: A lot of the content, I feel, is more reminiscent of indie RPGs in general than The Mountain Witch specifically. Most of my experience with RPGs has come from the ones that are made freely available as well as freeform RPGs that I used to play on play-by-post sites like RPoL in which all of these elements are present. My game design concepts have also come from videogames (the main place where I learned that backstabbing other players as a mechanic is somehow fun +_+) and card and boardgames. The latter two are more limited to what I've read about them, though. Just as with RPGs, I've only really ever been able to "afford" the free ones.<br/><br/>For the Narrator section, I'm not sure how much of a snag I have hit upon. I feel that I may have underestimated how much detail is required to explain how the game is put into motion based on the problems you are having with it. I intended for the game to be relatively easy to plan and play, but it seems I may have made it appear more complicated than necessary. My idea was for Narrators to be able come up with some ideas, following the suggestions in the text but definitely allowing for them to customize their game, and then quickly put them into play with a minimum of preparation. This preparation would only require some notes of the general story the Narrator has in mind (following what the game lays out, this might be, "The adventurers must go to the Cold Palace retrieve the mask of the God-king for the Princess.") and some things the Narrator might like to see (a pair of ghostly children that ask for the group to give them their most valuable member; the group has to cross a rickety bridge - a chance to turn on the others?). Ideally, the Narrator would not require a high level of structure and is mostly meant to "go with the flow," if you will. The ideas, other than the players' main objective, would not be set in stone and the Narrator should adapt to the path the players take while still presenting interesting obstacles for the players (they may go West instead of East, but that doesn't mean you can't have them come across a hostile village or introduce a demon).<br/><br/>I may have been too vague in my wording of the Narrator's section. I will review it and see how I can change it to better represent the game's ideas. I would very much like any more feedback you could provide in regards to this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361064/#Comment_361064" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T07:11:28+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  7:11AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel: That paragraph you just wrote is crystal clear to me and much easier to understand than the text in the book, IMO.  I mean, that's pretty much how The Mountain Witch is run and not that dissimilar from Mouse Guard or Bliss Stage either.  I totally get "specific mission + a few ideas about complications and challenges."  That's a kind of GM planning and play style that I feel like I know how to do.<br/><br/>Vague GM guidelines can actually be okay in some places.  I think the most important part is knowing which parts are set-in-stone and need to be explained explicitly (because otherwise the game won't really work), and which parts are really open to interpretation and can be explained briefly or in more vague terms (allowing individual GMs and groups of players to handle them however they see fit).  A longer text and more detailed explanation is not always what you want and I honestly like how compact and direct the gametext currently is.<br/><br/>Now I'm definitely interested in trying it out at some point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable" title="wicked.fable"><img alt="wicked.fable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/614786/Avatar_48x50.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable">wicked.fable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361077/#Comment_361077" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T08:06:02+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  8:06AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I think I understand what you mean now.

That's something that I am glad is being remedied with this release. <br/><br/>I would love to hear how your game goes should you give God-king a try. I've got a fair amount of work to do for the next few days, but I will update the playtest PDF as soon as possible. If there's anything else, please do let me know.

Thanks for being so responsive, Daniel. Honestly, I would be wary of adapting the text too dramatically in response to feedback, because I think up-and-coming game designers are often too eager to please their very small initial audience (which will hopefully grow over time).  Make sure you maintain a solid sense of what the game is about and don't let anyone (including me!) dissuade you from or confuse you about what you want the game to be!  That said, we're all constantly attempting to get better at writing and playing games, so if you see some space to clarify your intent, that's obviously cool too.<br/><br/>I'll definitely let you know if I get to try it out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable" title="wicked.fable"><img alt="wicked.fable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/614786/Avatar_48x50.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable">wicked.fable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361144/#Comment_361144" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T12:12:28+00:00" title="February 21, 2012 12:12PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Jonathan, that's some sound advice.

For the most part I will be keeping the same content, but I am going to rewrite some of the Narrator section to be more concise. I will also try to get the Journey section revised as that is definitely something I want to be made more interesting - I have to confess that I do not like the writing for the opening scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361179/#Comment_361179" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T13:54:18+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  1:54PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree: the stuff you wrote above about how to run the game is much clearer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable" title="wicked.fable"><img alt="wicked.fable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/614786/Avatar_48x50.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable">wicked.fable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368532/#Comment_368532" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T16:34:32+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  4:34PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry that it has taken so long for me to get back to everyone about God-king. I have updated the playtest release today and the new version can be downloaded from the same link above. The lengthy opening sequence has been done away with and most of the information provided in it has been rewritten into the locations and inhabitants of Otugari sections. I have also rewritten the opening parts of the Narrator section to, hopefully, make the job of the Narrator much clearer. I would love to hear if that objective has, indeed, been accomplished.<br/><br/>I hope you will all be able to put together a playtest session of God-king from what has been provided.
