                    So, here's something that's been going around in my head for a while that I finally committed to a rough form: a quick(er) form of resolution for HERO combats, for when you don't want to mess around with all the hexes and speed charts.<br/>
<br/>
(If you want to join in the discussion of making the little bits better, there's a thread over on the Herogames forum.)  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what I'm looking for from the Storygamers is:<br/>
<br/>
1) Some pleasant affirmations.  Some people in the HERO crowd are hostile to this sort of thing.  :(<br/>
<br/>
2) Ways to stretch the limits of HERO and task-resolution in general even more.  Let's awesome-o-fy it!<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
Combat By Scene Resolution in the Hero System:<br/>
<br/>
Step One:<br/>
<br/>
Determine Stakes.  There should be two sides involved, and each should be able to state clearly what they hope to get out of the conflict.  Some possibilities could be â€œbeat them up,â€ â€œget the MacGuffin,â€ â€œget awayâ€ â€œdrive the attackers awayâ€ â€œlook like heroes in front of the media,â€ etc.  Stakes cannot include definitive defeat of the other side- if you want to kill or otherwise permanently take out your enemy, youâ€™ve got to do it the hard way!  Note that sometimes defeating your enemy wonâ€™t even be important at all to what you really want.<br/>
<br/>
If the parties involved canâ€™t be split into two sides, or the players involved canâ€™t agree on a single stake for their side, the conflict is probably too complex to be handled with these rules.<br/>
<br/>
The stakes should be agreeable to all sides, and of roughly equal weight.<br/>
<br/>
Step Two:<br/>
<br/>
Determine Dice Pools:<br/>
<br/>
Each side will have a number of dice to roll.  This is determined as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Participants:  1d6 per participant.<br/>
High-Power Participants:  If a character is worth 100 character points or more, they are instead worth 1d6 for every 50 character points.<br/>
Majority of Characterâ€™s Powers are Unusable:  -1d6<br/>
Character has Particularly Relevant Disadvantage: +1d6<br/>
Character has Particularly Advantageous Power: +1d6<br/>
Character has Extremely Advantageous Power: +2d6<br/>
Superior Starting Position: +1d6, or more<br/>
Superior Equipment: +1d6, or more<br/>
<br/>
Powers and Skills:<br/>
<br/>
Every character involved may make a Luck roll and must make an Unluck roll.  Every active Luck or Unluck die adds/subtracts a die from the sideâ€™s Die Pool.<br/>
<br/>
If half or more (at least two characters) of the characters on a side have Teamwork, their side gets +1d6.  If they all do (at least four characters), their side gets +2d6.<br/>
<br/>
One character from each side should make an opposed Tactics roll.  The winnerâ€™s side gets +1d6 for every 2 points they beat the opponent.<br/>
<br/>
Step Three:<br/>
<br/>
Resolution:  Each side rolls their combat pool and counts body.  Whichever side has the higher total has won the combat, and achieves their stakes.<br/>
<br/>
On a tie, the players have a few options:  one is to work out a stalemate or compromise: declare that neither side got their stakes, or each got some part of their stakes.  Or for a big unexpected outcome, perhaps *both* sides achieve their stakes- this is great for really big die pools.  If compromise or stalemate is impossible, the players may be default to a standard HERO combat.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, each character should roll on the fallout table to see what resources were expended and injuries were suffered.  (Pending)                </div>

                            This is an interesting and useful project.  I really like Hero, particularly when I want to have a 'tactical' battle.  But sometimes there is just not enough time!  I had thought about using 'Pulp Hero' for an adventure I'm running at Dreamation, 'A Head of His Time', but I've chosen instead to use 'Spirit of the Century' because I think the conflict resolution will be faster.  Your 'team battle' concept is a neat idea.  Have you tried it out?<br/>
