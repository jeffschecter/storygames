Complications cover stress.<br/><br/>Everything else works basically straight out of MHR.<br/><br/>The goal is something with a bit more interpersonal drama, and that runs a bit quicker, than bog standard MHR. Also the complications make for more interesting and unexpected twists than the Doom Pool.<br/><br/>I'm running a play test over pbp, if anyone's interested pm me. I thought teen superheroes would be the best way try this first.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432999/#Comment_432999" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-25T11:07:14+00:00" title="May 25, 2014 11:07AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick note, Values/Relationships run way slower than Affiliations on the player end at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433002/#Comment_433002" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-25T11:40:31+00:00" title="May 25, 2014 11:40AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe they will.

As long as we had some kind of general guidelines on which Affiliation was appropriate, whether or not anyone got it right on any particular roll wasn't worth worrying about. (Seriously, it's only one die in a large pool, so even if someone uses a d10 instead of a d8 or a d6, it really doesn't have <i>that</i> much impact in the mid-to-high power range.*)<br/><br/><br/>For whatever it's worth, our guidelines were:<br/><br/>- If you're getting help from anyone else, you can't be Solo. (We <i>loved</i> getting help from other characters, so this was a big one.)<br/><br/>- If what you're doing requires another character in the scene to be worth doing (flanking maneuvers or "softening up" a villain for someone else's attack), you should be using Buddy at a minimum. Team if it requires more than one other character.<br/><br/>- If you are in fact the only good guy there, you're Solo. (Obviously.)<br/><br/>- Beyond that, whatever works in your mind is probably okay with everyone else at the table. Tailor your description to whatever affiliation you want to use, it's really not a big deal.<br/><br/><br/>* I imagine that in a much lower-powered game with much smaller die pools -- like, all the characters are novice SHIELD agents or something and have no powers and very little equipment -- the affiliation die might become more important. But I'm not sure MHR really works that great at that end of the spectrum anyway, so maybe it's irrelevant?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433019/#Comment_433019" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-26T08:52:54+00:00" title="May 26, 2014  8:52AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>+1 for using Leverage as basis.

Most characters would be Strength+Hitter anyway. Or there would be several varieties of Hitter. <br/><br/>Yeah, one dice each, but to keep the number of dice about the same they only get one die from powers, instead of one die from each set.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433020/#Comment_433020" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-26T08:59:14+00:00" title="May 26, 2014  8:59AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Affiliations.

If they take the d10 instead of the d8, it doesn't matter all that much to their roll. (In the long run, it might actually suck a little bit for them to keep doing it, because the reduced odds of getting a plot point can't really be made up for by the very tiny bump in their roll they get from always grabbing for their d10.)<br/><br/>Affiliation isn't a particularly compelling thing in play; it's a neat way of describing a character, but once you start building dice pools, it's almost entirely meaningless. Which maybe means it's a good idea to swap it out for a more meaningful Smallville-style value+relationship combo, but <i>not</i>, I think, if your goal is to make things go <i>faster</i>. Figuring out how a relationship applies to some rolls can be a huge speed bump, in my experience, while it's easy to just roll your eyes condescendingly and go with it whenever someone keeps arguing that they're totally Solo when they're flying a quinjet full of Avengers into the living island's face.<br/><br/>YMMV, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433029/#Comment_433029" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-26T12:34:12+00:00" title="May 26, 2014 12:34PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2014 12:38PM by liblarva.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I don't harbor any illusions that the Values and Relationships switch will make things quicker in and of itself, probably about a fair trade from my experience.
