The other players were Nick, Patty, Sam, and me.  Although Dirty Secrets is GM-less, one player plays the investigator character throughout the game\u2014Sam volunteered for that.  The other players take turns being the main opposition to the investigator player, assigning roles to other players as necessary for each scene.  Our game started slow as I think only Nick had played before.  Once we had each of the scene types and a conflict or two under our belt, though, we rapidly picked up the pace of the scenes.<br/>Character creation resulted in mostly wealthy black and Asian characters\u2014with a Vietnamese (by name) investigator so we set our game in a 1970s West Coast city on the border between \u2018China\u2019 Town and the African-American section\u2014with a mix of competition and cooperation between the ethnic groups.  Implicit in the setting were some connections between the black Americans and the Vietnamese as a result of the Vietnam War.  <br/>The crimes in our game were theft of some jewelry\u2014the Hanoi Diadem\u2014from a young, wealthy black woman and a murder.  The game started with the theft already committed with Babette as the victim.  Babette called in her acquaintance, David Nguyen, the investigator, because he owed her a favor.  While investigating the theft, Nguyen witnesses Babette being harassed by Tony Nixon, an undercover cop, who is demanding the gem from her, not believing it was stolen.  Nguyen gets in a fistfight with Nixon, and leaves Nixon bleeding on the sidewalk\u2014although Nguyen loses a dental crown in the process.  As sort of a comic interlude (in a Reflection type scene) Nguyen goes to the dentist to have his crown repaired.  We learn that Nguyen has a lot of dental work\u2014he gets into a lot of fights!  If this were a weekly TV show, or a Primetime Adventures game, the dental chair would be Nguyen\u2019s personal set where he gets to tell us (the audience\u2014through his dentist) how things are going.  Then Nguyen goes to the nightclub where Babette is a singer and learns that a young patron is flashing a lot of new money.  Nguyen trails the patron, Yan (I think) and realizes he has a relationship with a female federal agent named Jane Lane (whose real name is Jin Lin) and who previously arrested Nguyen, who is an ex-con himself.  Nguyen tails Jane to the residence of the club owner, Osaka-san.  Sneaking around back, Nguyen hears a gunshot and reaches the pool where Osaka is floating, dead in the water.  A pistol lays on a table between Jane and Yan.  From hiding, Nguyen surprises Yan and uses him to fool Jane into getting close.  Jane reveals that Tony Nixon did steal the Diadem and brought it to Osaka.  Nguyen uses Yan as cover, but Jane shoots Yan and runs to Osaka\u2019s safe, grabs the Diadem, and escapes.<br/>A couple of things that I enjoyed about the game mechanics.  First, a grid is used to determine the perpetrator of each crime.  The grid starts out basically empty.  At the conclusion of each scene, the investigator player moves a token around the grid and writes a name down in each cell.  Eventually, all the cells have a name.  When that happens, the token is randomly placed in a cell.  The name in this cell is the perpetrator of the crime under investigation.  So in play, things happen that seem to not make sense and once the perpetrator is revealed we have to figure out why it does, in fact, make sense.  For example, the scene where Nixon was demanding the Diadem from Babette\u2014even though he was the thief!  Interestingly, early in the game (before Tony\u2019s guilt was revealed) Sam speculated that Tony was the thief and that he was just trying to shake down Babette for more money or something.  I thought this was preposterous!  Shows what I know!  <br/>The second thing I liked was the way \u2018Dirty Secrets\u2019 establishes the dirty secrets\u2014the relationships between the characters.  The investigator either determines one character whom he wants to be one side of a relationship (business, romantic, etc) and the other side of the relationship is determined randomly, as well as the relationship type.  Alternately, the investigator player determines the two characters between which he wants there to be a relationship, but the actual type of relationship is determined randomly.  In our game, Yan led to Jane because we learned that they had a romantic relationship.  And Tony led to Osaka because of a business relationship.  We had fun making sense of all the relationships\u2014how each relationship provided motivations for the characters\u2019 actions. <br/>Mel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175306/#Comment_175306" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T10:22:40+00:00" title="October 17, 2008 10:22AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks for playing <i>Dirty Secrets</i>!

I believe there is a lot of subtlety in certain parts of the game that I'm looking forward to discovering with more play.  Of these, two that come to mind are how to play Liars' Dice better and how the Investigator player can shape the story through the names placed on the story grid (or whatever it is called).  In our conflicts with the Liars' Dice, the progression of bids seemed very predictable.  It was only once we began re-rolling portions of the dice pool that I think we started to see the potential to achieve high numbers of matching dice.  And since the names on the story grid determine the probability of which character is the criminal, I can see where the players can shape the scenes around the most likely criminals.<br/>Of the questions that came up in play, I recall we were uncertain when the victim of the 2nd and subsequent crimes is determined.  We decided the victim is identified during play.  When the investigator player adds multiple names to the grid, we were uncertain if the names could be the same or not.  And we did not see the point of the different rules for conflicts in Violence scenes versus conflicts in other scene types; it seemed like variation for variation's sake.  But I expect there is some statistical rationale.  <br/>About halfway through the game, Nick pointed out that as we were resolving the conflicts using the Liars' Dice, we were not roleplaying the increasing stakes and tension as the bids increased.  So we made an effort to improve that as the game continued.  And we found using a relationship map very useful to see the connections between the characters, especially as new relationships were created during the game.  I suspect the advice to use a relationship map is already part of the rules.  \n<blockquote><br/>Finally, Reflection sequences from a dentist chair...I love it!<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, we all got a kick out of that!<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175345/#Comment_175345" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T15:21:07+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  3:21PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>Of these, two that come to mind are how to play Liars' Dice better and how the Investigator player can shape the story through the names placed on the story grid (or whatever it is called).</blockquote>\nSure. I gave guidance on some of those issues in the book, but those are things that are best learned through play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>Of the questions that came up in play, I recall we were uncertain when the victim of the 2nd and subsequent crimes is determined.

The idea is that the event is narrated (which would include identifying the victim), and then someone can Declare that event to be a Crime.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>When the investigator player adds multiple names to the grid, we were uncertain if the names could be the same or not.</blockquote>\nOh yes, absolutely. You're supposed to write down the name of the person who you thought looked suspicious as a result of the events of that sequence.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>And we did not see the point of the different rules for conflicts in Violence scenes versus conflicts in other scene types; it seemed like variation for variation's sake.
