                    This is a summary of a game of Shock: played by me and two friends in the middle of December last year. I thought I'd try to translate some of my thoughts written down in a Swedish actual play post at the time. <br/><br/>The session didn't get finished and has been left hanging. We really want to confront our Story Goals though and have arranged a session next week to play it out. So this is a way to get the game fresh in mind as well, and maybe iron out any misconceptions. Any comments, questions and observations are welcome.<br/><br/>So, we're three players. That's me, Jonas and Magnus. Jonas and I have been playing together in various constellations over the last couple of years. We'd had contact with Magnus for a while, him being curious about a lot of the same games as us. We finally got together to try something out with Shock:.<br/><br/>Our game was set in a distant future on a unfriendly, unnamed planet, ravaged by wild, constant changing weather. The only inhabited colony on the planet was part of a forgotten and now collapsing utopian project. Had it ever worked, the utopia had now some serious dents in the design. We had a government trying to uphold the idealism more as an illusion than anything else. In the meantime poverty and class issues started coming to the surface but were swept beneath the rug.<br/><br/>We settled for the Shock Colonization and the Issues Authenticity and Class rifts. Actually we first had the Shock Artificial Weather but later changed that to Minutiae. It was pretty weak and we became aware of the importance of making sure everyone clicked with the stuff that goes on the Grid.<br/><br/>The talk afterwards exposed some thoughts about the Praxis not being that engaging either. They were Lying vs Telling the truth and Courage vs Cowardice.<br/>They're a bit philosophical but I could relate to them and for me they played a major part in addressing things in conflicts. Still, obivously we could have taken some more time to talk things through during the set up here as well.<br/><br/>My protag is named Change, a young girl working with propaganda/advertising. She was more or less a living spam bot on the street and I imagined her as sort of selfless, programmed and lacking in own identity. She believed totally in the success of the Utopian movement, it's history and future. As Antagonist I asked Jonas that it would come in form of a young man who was part of a rebellion. My Story goal was: To fall in love. Change's place on the Grid were between Colonization and Authenticity.<br/><br/>Jonas confronted me with Isle who mocked me, despised me for my lies and offered to show me the true side of society. Change convinced him to come with her to Sunset, a new apartment area built on the first settlement. There they saw true happiness, perhaps ignorant and self consciously so, but still. A fake rain fell over them as Isle watched children run out in the yards, laughing. This was me winning my intent. Jonas won his too and Change and Isle then went to Bluewater and got there when the darkness fell. Change hadn't cried in years but as Isle walked her through a world hidden from her and so far apart from her reality tears ran down her face.<br/><br/>When they met again Change had started to think about this and she was humoured and fascinated with Isle. He stuck some pamphlets in her hand though and told her to "do something real". Change wants a date. She wants to meet this guy, talk to him. She wants to do it in that new place over in Sunset. Sure she'll hand out the pamphlets, she lies. Isle doesn't listen. He scoffs. I escalate. She kisses him. He brushes her off, walks away. "Just hand them out". She does.<br/><br/>I'll mention the others briefly. They deserve more though.<br/><br/>The scenes between Jonas' protag and Magnus were so cool. So intense and slowburning that I completely forgot about Minutiae and just sat and listened. Jonas played Rilo. The perfect bureaucrat of the perfect bureaucracy. She was a pedant and art lover and Jonas wanted her to lose her faith in society. Her opposition came in the form of Production Unit 13, a mysterious and anonymous place the seemed to delay and falsify important reports and papers.<br/><br/>Jonas admitted afterwards that he was a bit concerned about the vague Antagonist. But Magnus role-played the part perfectly and the result was thrillingly Kafkaesque (yeah, I've seen The Squid and the Whale). Most of the interaction took place over the telephone. Jonas one time had to escalate, go to the huge factory-like place and gets the papers he need to later start an investigation of the matter. Rilo faces the Authenticity Issue and is well on her way to her Story Goal. Growing more and more frustrated with PU 13. Is it perhaps significant of larger corruption in society - a sign of something worse?<br/><br/>Playing Antagonist to Magnus protagonist Wagner was a joy. Ours was the first scene of the session and I started it off a bit lame and it stumbled a bit. We were still finding our feet and fished for a conflict for a while. There was some great narration and colour provided by Magnus. Wagner was a worker who believed wholesale in the propaganda machine. Would things go his way he would land a job as volunteer/member of the government. He was stuck between the Shock and Class rifts.<br/><br/>My antagonist, Truman Fritz, a superior and union boss, had ordered Wagner to shut down some weather generators that controlled the weather in Bluewater and kept the wild winds and rains at bay. They were needed in the new shiny Sunset district. Later, in the follow up scene, Wagner watched on the news how the hurricane weather tore Bluewater apart while their inhabitants try to set up temporary reactors and weather generators. Stolen, said Fritz who showed up and demanded that Wagner brought some men and took them down.<br/><br/>Magnus risked a link here ("My Job") and went to Bluewater and tried to help the people there set them up instead. But I won this conflict and they beat him and drove him off while calling him lackey and tool.<br/><br/>Shock: as game is right up my alley. There's a lot of neat mechanical stuff that drives stuff toward my sweet spot. It tricks me into caring about things important to me, which is just what I want a game to do. Praxis is the tool to drive toward theme in this game as far as I'm concerned. Want to play a truthful character in a lying society? Set your Fulcra on the scale so that it becomes easier for you to lie; resist, lose conflicts and gain Features and perhaps truth will pay off in the end. Or lie, lie, lie because you get away with it.<br/><br/>The questions about what's real and what's authentic focused on really mundane, recognizable things like thoughts, emotions and living conditions struck a cord with me. I'm eager to use this game to approach a lot of other things that I may not know the weight of consciously yet.<br/><br/>It was really fun to roll the dice, push them in front of you and play them out, Dogs-style, raising or lowering your opponents result. I wish we'd been better with using Minutiae and fleshing out the world. We got into some discussions about how it applied at some point, I can't recall what now, and after that more or less dropped them (or me just forgetting about it). I have an inkling though, that using Minutiae is as important as the Moons roles in Polaris for fulfilling play.<br/><br/>I want to see to it that a stronger Shock is chosen from the start next time and also that greater care is taken with noting each Protagonists place on the Grid. The owners of the Shock and Issues should really take hold of their subjects as well; fill them out and establish them firmly in play.<br/><br/>Since we're playing out the rest of the session in just a few days, I'll be back then with some more thoughts.                </div>

<p>Heh. "Tricks".</p>
<p>Praxis is only one of the pieces, don't forget. I think it should actually be the last thing the players decide, actually. It should be completely informed by Issues, Shocks, Features and Links. I know the book doesn't say to do it in that order, but it's what I've found works best, and it certainly doesn't break anything to do it that way. Praxis is only the handle, not the whole tool.</p>
<p>(I've been thinking about how to say this since Paul Tevis asked me why the game isn't called Praxis:. Marketing decisions aside, this is the answer, Paul, if you still care about the question.)</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing more about this!</p>

                            It makes sense to choose Praxis last. I'll keep that in mind.<br/><br/>And make no mistake, despite of what I wrote I do not in any way put any less value in Shocks, Issues and Features. I'll be careful to get those pieces prominent and informed of each other in future sessions. In fact I think that Praxis might have been so meaningful to me in play because we came up with a rather weak Shock at first.<br/><br/>Oh, and I mean tricks in the most positive kind of sense, kinda like "wields great magic to affect me". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>
