Most notably, Vox also incorporates a unique new central game mechanic (hence, the testing) which involves players taking on multiple roles that interact with one another in a much different way than in traditional RPGs. <br/>\n<br/>\nVox's setting is a mix between The X-Files and Memento, Paranoia and Wraith, Unknown Armies and Dead Inside. It's steeped in Jungian psychology and conspiracy theories.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a gaming group who is able and willing to playtest this game within the next few weeks/month, and are able and willing to provide  feedback on your experiences, please contact me. I am looking for mature, serious playtesters (having been burned with playtesting in the past) and I have every reason to believe that Story Games is a good place to find those sorts of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time and consideration.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176074/#Comment_176074" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T11:21:02+00:00" title="October 24, 2008 11:21AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Michael!<br/><br/>as that you're new here, i feel i ought to tell you about the fivelings and Days Of Awareness and all that nonsense.<br/><br/>...actually i'm making a joke based on something someone else was saying... anyway.<br/>to what you're addressing:<br/><br/>well, i got burned out on PDQ a while ago, playing a longish T&amp;J game. BUT! my group is still pretty stoked on ideas from the system and have been talking about shifting things and welding other bits on... sounds like you've done just that. <br/>so i'd be happy to take a look at it and pitch it to the folks, no saying what they'll think or if it'll get over my burn marks.<br/>all that depressing stuff out of the way, however, it sounds really awesome.<br/><br/>so send it on down to<br/>fall DOT away AT yahoo DOT ie<br/>and you and me will be in some serious email contact.<br/><br/>ps double fucking stoked on multiple characters interaction mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176307/#Comment_176307" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-26T07:19:18+00:00" title="October 26, 2008  7:19AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, just a point of interest:<br/><br/>I saw Mike's ashcan of VOX: He brought it with him to the Hellas booth (BTW, Mike's the co-author of Hellas, which is like my favorite game to come out this year).<br/><br/>It looked hot. Spooky pseudo-psychology meets conspiracies, in a system where, IIRC, players play multiple personalities of other players' characters. (correct me if I'm wrong)<br/><br/>Not giving it a "you must play at all costs!!" endorsement, but just know that it's in a solid "ashcan form" right now, and at least I thought it was pretty cool when I flipped through it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176378/#Comment_176378" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T00:19:43+00:00" title="October 27, 2008 12:19AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have about 10 people signed up so I'm going to close ranks for now.
