Basically the players are agents of Null State, the organisation that moves in and cleans up when secret government projects are abandoned or go hay-wire and no-one else wants to pretend they exist.<br/><br/>The players are supposed to be mostly ordinary people who have one thing they happen to be the very best at, like a student who's the world's greatest hacker or a housewife who used to be a cat burglar or something.<br/>The team also has an Operator, who simply sits at base, co-ordinates them, relays intel, sends reinforcements and so on. This is usually done by the GM. Oh, and the game is mostly real-time; so if the killer robots are activated in five minutes, you have five minutes irl. I'm starting the timer. What do you do?<br/><br/>However, one of my players is staying out of town for much of the summer, and to not keep them out of the role-playing action we thought we'd try to make em the Operator. E'd sit across the country with a skype connection and a dossier of sub-optimally organised "intel" that I (the GM) has prepared and given em before e left. In real-time, the players would have to interact with me, telling me what they do as usual; and with the Operator, who in turn has to search through, cross-reference and present information about floor plans, guard patrols, door pass codes and stuff.<br/><br/><br/>First up, does this sound fun? Does it sound like it could work so that both the agent players and the Operator player will have fun? Obviously not everyone likes time pressure at all, but assuming you do?<br/><br/>Second, what are some interesting stuff to give the Operator player? So far I've decided on:<br/>- Maps (that aren't too clear on what's what)<br/>- Hand-written about operation procedures from an agent who's been in this place before - containing clues about where the cameras are, when the guards patrol and stuff<br/>- Cryptic computer printouts of some kind<br/><br/>Third, what plot twists are appropriate? This is a one-shot or at most two sessions. I'm thinking of having someone being a traitor: either one of the agents, one of the spare agents that are sent in when the originals die (they do) or even the Operator emself? I think the most effective would be one of the agents, and let the Operator know after a while that "one of them is a traitor, you don't know how".<br/><br/>EDIT: I realised it's possible to read this post as if I designed the game myself; I didn't. <a href="http://http://www.nullstate.se/" rel="nofollow">Null State</a> is made by Mikael Bergstr\xf6m.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325894/#Comment_325894" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T12:34:11+00:00" title="May 23, 2011 12:34PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2011 12:36PM by mease19.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a blast.

Consider sending all info through the operator and have him relate it to the players.

Sadly, it wasn't fun to play the Operator, and I abandoned the project. (Also, our other co-op game, Schizoid, didn't sell that well, so I was kind of soured on games that require co-op.)<br/><br/>So - why wasn't it fun to play the Operator? Anything there that might apply?<br/><br/>Well, there were a lack of interesting decisions. If the agent needed to get through a door, you had to hack that door. Past a camera, you had to hack that camera. Maybe if there's a camera and a door...and if you hack the door your agent will be seen, but if you hack the camera the agent will have to smash down the door and be heard, then maybe it would be something. (The agent bitching at you either way, "Why didn't you do X?")<br/><br/>There was also no hacking mini-game: it simply took some number of seconds to hack something. I didn't think a mini-game would save it: then operator/agent would just be two solo games being played simultaneously. But that works for Puzzle Pirates, so I could be wrong, there. So I see some potential in giving your Operator stats and things to roll for. If he makes his Archive roll he can pull up old blueprints of the government building, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325910/#Comment_325910" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T13:17:21+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  1:17PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I did a Cyberpunk Repo Man game, my wife played the operator who sent the repo agents out to steal the cars the banks wanted stolen.

Like, instead of being the traitor meaning "I will sabotage this mission and damage the organization at any cost," make it more like "I have a personal agenda that I will attempt to fulfill at someone else's expense, if I think I can."  That way, if the traitor gets revealed, it's just another situation to deal with and not a reason for everyone to shoot each other in the face.<br/><br/>Say that the Null State team has just cracked open one of those North Korean megabunkers that are supposed to house the population in an emergency, but has since been repurposed to, oh, I don't know, clone Kim Jong-Il with some improvements (taller hair and eye-lasers).  At midnight, the clone tanks will be decanted and the Glorious Army of the Glorious Leaders will march on South Korea, lasering everything they see.  One person on the team is the black-hat hacker, there to bypass security and help the other two (the geneticist and the urban explorer) take the whole program off-line before zero hour.  Except...he's also accepted a contract with a pharmaceutical company back in the US to yoink all the data on cloning (including the eye-laser genes) and bring it home to them.  If he does it, his sick mom gets all the medical care she needs, plus he gets rich...but it compromises Null State's goal of preventing future crises like this one.  It also goes against the geneticist's moral code, because human cloning is one step too far, in her opinion.  If he gets caught trying to do it, everyone can argue about what to do next while still keeping on track for shutting down the Korean War part deux.  So, on the one side, hacker boy (cancer drugs and cash); on the other, the geneticist (moral outrage) and the Null State controller (the larger mission); as a wildcard, the UrbEx guy.  One big mission for everyone to pull together on, one small situation for them to resolve among themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326122/#Comment_326122" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T09:05:29+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  9:05AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good one.
