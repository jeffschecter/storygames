I'm especially searching for a system that could work as a celebration of the movies' color, and helps/rewards for creating flashy stunts and action.<br/>\nI doubt that moral issues should be a central part of such a game apart from a simple good vs. evil dualism.<br/>\n<br/>\nShock: could for instance be interesting if one sees it from the transformers' perspective of having lost one's planet and found a new, inhabitable yet already inhabited one, so something akin to a diaspora shock. But it makes the story drift into complex issues, which is not the movies' point... although it would be interesting, in my opinion. Much more interesting if you take their situation and put in humans instead of Transformers, so a human diaspora after Earth's destruction to an alien inhabited world where the human species splits into two factions, one of invaders and one of protectors of the new world. <br/>\nFarewell to the Transformers' color.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimetime Adventures could be used, but it helps little with the action part.<br/>\nAny other ideas?<br/>\nThanks in advance.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247450/#Comment_247450" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T04:38:32+00:00" title="December 18, 2009  4:38AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's always FATE, that seems to work well for most things and does actively encourage stunts.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247453/#Comment_247453" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T05:01:05+00:00" title="December 18, 2009  5:01AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2009 6:58PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so this is going to sound crazy and I throw it out alot but Dogs in the Vineyard with the Town Creation part hacked to shit.<br/><br/>The reasons are these: First, I always felt Transformers was about relationships and what fighting for what you thought was right would cost you. Second, it scales well and handles cinematic action perfectly. Thirdly, Traits 4d10 I'm a Fucking Big Rig. Finally, Escalation seems to work pretty well too.<br/><br/>You'd need to make sure that the initial situations put alot of pressure on the crew and change the whole demonic influence bit.

The human shouldn't be around when the transformer is around, and there should always be at least 1 human around.  Humans should be able to have a positive effect on a transformer's abilities. They can also accomplish tasks impossible for a giant robot.  However, they're obviously very squishy.
