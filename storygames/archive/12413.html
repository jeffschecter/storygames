"Hey, run it back to the pre-snap and pause? OK, yeah, that's where the nickel was, over on the weak side, showing blitz! Run it... pause! Yeah, OK, so the center saw it but it was out-of-frame for us after they cut to the offense camera, that's what happened. That explains the awkward audible to the outside run. PAUSE! no, back a second. He stutters like ten times after he takes the handoff because of the light set, he needs someone to get in front of the strongside backer, run, PAUSE, there's the slot coming in to seal SAM to the inside, not going to happen this time, buddy... why didn't they just do a one-step drop to the slot on a slant, or a Steelers screen? Oh, Jaws, how would we know they really play football down there without your infinite wisdom? (Rewatch play, a charlie foxtrot that goes for two yards.)" I'm that guy, takes me five hours to really enjoy watching a game, and alternating between thinking out loud about the play and berating the announcers for their vapidity. I think I need to find an alternate structure for my football watching, or alternately cultivate some of my friends into football tactics fans (or Waldorf to my Statler for the broadcast teams).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279129/#Comment_279129" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T12:23:13+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 12:23PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>I really need to get back to my idea for a football story game, where there's an oracle mechanic based on a game you're watching as you play.<br/><br/>The problem for me is that I'm always watching football in the way that's the most boring for everyone else. "Hey, run it back to the pre-snap and pause? OK, yeah, that's where the nickel was, over on the weak side, showing blitz! Run it... pause! Yeah, OK, so the center saw it but it was out-of-frame for us after they cut to the offense camera, that's what happened. That explains the awkward audible to the outside run. PAUSE! no, back a second. </blockquote>\nI'd pay for a 1-900 line that would talk like this to me.  There's so many things happening invisibly on every play, and when I watch a ball game, I'm always curious to know the non-obvious reasons for failure.  Did the receiver run the wrong option?  Did the QB audible into a stupid play?  What did the QB see that made him audible?   Does the offence have a tell that the defence is reading?  Etc, etc.<br/><br/>How does one be a student of football?  I've only ever played flag, and I've watched it all my life -- but mostly on television, where I have to rely on the analysis of the commentators to understand the thinking part of the game.  <br/><br/>Glenn Suitor, who did color for the Als-Roughriders game last night, is probably the best CFL broadcaster in terms of breaking down plays.  Last night he had a keen moment where he showed the passing lane that the Riders' O-line opened on a quick slant, from the QB's view.  I hadn't realized before how important it was that the O-Line clear a lane for the quick throws  until I saw it from Darian Durant's point of view...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
