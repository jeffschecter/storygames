After years of GMing for smaller groups of 3-4 players I'm really wanting to shift my mindset in storytelling. I'm trying to find those genres, systems, and stories that mesh well with larger groups. What stories and games fit well with bigger groups?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437305/#Comment_437305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T15:01:10+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  3:01PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The less points-of-contact in the system, the better. That means avoid fiddly mechanics. <br/><br/>Find systems (and in-game situations) that focus on role-playing and social interaction instead of combat. Combat slows down incredibly with large groups. If you want combat to be a part of play, use a system that abstracts combat to fewer rolls. <br/><br/><b>Simpler Games</b><br/><br/><b>Fate</b> has a certain amount of mechanical crunch that will make certain kinds of gamers happy, yet it plays quickly. Combats are fairly abstract, but with more than a single roll to resolve it. It's also a game that rewards player creativity and encourages players to take on some of the roles often reserved for the GM (like spending a Fate point to invent stuff that is in the room). Fate is genre-less, and is super easy to adapt to just about anything. There are Fate-based games like Dresden Files that I don't think I'd recommend for large groups, but it might be possible. Spirit of the Century is a pulp heroes game built on Fate, and it would probably be okay for 8 players?<br/><br/>I've had success running <b>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</b> with large groups. The characters and mechanics are super light and fast and produce hilarious, fun play. It's early-1900's comedic-horror set in a sleepy New England college town. You all play faculty vying for institutional reputation.<br/><br/><b>Simpler Games like D&amp;D</b><br/><br/>If you're looking for a replacement for typical fantasy gaming (a la D&amp;D):<br/><br/>I've run fairly large groups with <b>Dungeon World</b>. It will give you the feel of a D&amp;D game without all the overhead. <br/><br/>Consider <b>Basic D&amp;D (Moldvay)</b>. The old B/X game is crazy-simple and still crazy-fun. There's no reason you can't do all the same role-playing you do in modern D&amp;D. Meanwhile, the combats are super fast and easy. I've run tables of 9-10 players.<br/><br/><b>Split into Three Groups</b><br/><br/>You could break into two or three separate tables and all play <b>Fiasco</b>, in which characters with big ambition and poor impulse control end up in bad situations, a la a Coen Brother's movie. If you all use the same playset, you can compare notes after to see where you all diverged. <br/><br/><b>Shock:</b> is a science-fiction game best played with 3-4 people at a time. You could all work together to create the setting shared among the three tables (takes an hour tops), then make different characters for each table and compare notes when you're done.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437309/#Comment_437309" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T15:55:59+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  3:55PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2014 4:05PM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was a teenager, I had a roleplaying group consisting of fifteen people, and sometimes I had 7-8 people during a session. <br/><br/>I would say that you need to change how you act as a game master. With 3-4 players, you need to take an active part (only one player is really intense), but with 7-8 players, you can be more laid back and concentrate on creating reactions on what the players do. It can sometimes be good to split the group into two to take care of different tasks. Imagine yourself having a ball. Throw it to one group. Let them play with it themselves. Activate the other group.<br/><br/>Constantly focus on activating or reacting to what the groups do.<br/><br/>Thrive when the group is arguing. Then they are engaged.<br/><br/>Don't expect to set goals such as "finish the mission". You will benefit more from having open-ended scenarios, like fish tanks or using group bangs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437318/#Comment_437318" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T21:53:32+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  9:53PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ve played in these large sessions twice.

These have worked provided the player characters are pointed at each other and provided that some of the more complex BW mechanics (such as Fight) are switched off. Characters are pointed at each other through Beliefs about each other and through Beliefs that conflict about other things. I'm specifically thinking of the BW convention scenario, 'the Inheritance' which was about a Viking(ish) extended family dealing with the death of its patriarch, and a scenario I wrote in homage to 'the Inheritance' called Quest for the Holy Grail. I haven't seen 'the Inheritance' posted anywhere but I've loaded 'Quest for the Grail' <a href="burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=File:Quest_for_the_Holy_Grail.pdf" rel="nofollow"> here. </a><br/>These scenarios are great for conventions or maybe 2-3 sessions locally.  Long term play would likely be hard.  They've worked for large groups because character actions focus on building and shifting alliances within the other player characters.  Despite what I mentioned about turning off BW mechanics, these scenarios also highlight the 'Duel of Wits' (DoW) mechanic, which is the social combat system.  Using the DoW we had nine characters debating an issue and every player was able to say something (in character), throw in a d6 and have some impact on the resolution.  It was great!<br/>Both 'the Inheritance' and 'Quest for the Grail' are a bit atypical of BW games in that there are a lot of secret Beliefs, but I'll save that discussion for another thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437363/#Comment_437363" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-15T14:22:19+00:00" title="August 15, 2014  2:22PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2014 2:22PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I run a weekly group of 7-8 people.  We've had a lot of success with AW and other PbtA games.  <br/><br/>The MC has to think about keeping the pace up b/c it can take a long time to come back around the table.  Especially in combat, and especially when some players are in combat while others are somewhere else.  Try and avoid that.  But that will be true of most any game you use.  I think PbtA games work well in large groups because (a) the mechanics are super simple, (b) the moves are right in the splats, and (c) there's a lot of improvisation on both MC and players' parts.  (Of course, this assumes that you and your group are ok with a lot of improvisation.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437431/#Comment_437431" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-17T05:48:48+00:00" title="August 17, 2014  5:48AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drama system (the core game in Hillfolk, which just won the Diana Jones Award) recommends a large group like that.  This is because the system is very simple and the interactions are mainly between PCs.  When I ran it for groups of 7ish, it worked just fine.  <br/><br/><br/>Whatever you play, you will want to keep your scenes short, though, so that the action comes back to each PC fairly regularly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
