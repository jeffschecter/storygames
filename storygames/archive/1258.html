                    In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1115&amp;page=1#Comment_28709" rel="nofollow">Review Exchange</a>, Jason raised the question about whether exchanging reviews was a good idea. Could we discuss that here?<br/><br/>(Colin, I hope this doesn't seem as though we're taking pot shots at your idea. The review exchange is a nice idea, but I think Jason's got a point, and it's worth discussing.)<br/><br/>It's fairly well-established, I think, that game designers "exchange" the work they do. I playtest your game; you return the favour by playtesting mine. You send me your game to read through and, a few months later, I ask you to read through mine.<br/><br/>And you do it with promoting games. You link to my web site; I link to yours.<br/><br/>Does this become problematic when we're doing things, like reviews, that are meant to be impartial? You and I agree to review each other's games. I post a nice review of your game. Now, you've played my game and you didn't actually like it, but you feel bad posting a nasty review: so you post a generally positive review and suppress your criticism to a brief paragraph at the end.<br/><br/>Or doesn't it matter? After all, this kind of thing probably happens anyway: you link to my game in your blog, I return the favour by posting a positive Actual Play report. Is exchanging reviews just a formalisation of the process?<br/><br/>(Jason, is this right or have I misrepresented your argument?)<br/><br/>I'm interested in what people think and, if this sort of thing has been tried before, how it has worked.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            Well, personally, I would think that a person who wrote an insincere review praising the few things that they could pretend to like about my game had completely failed me.  I'd much rather that they posted a sincere review saying "This game does the following things, very strongly.  I don't like those things, and so I didn't like the game."<br/>
<br/>
First:  I'd rather have honest criticism than insincere praise.<br/>
<br/>
Second:  Honest criticism generates a **lot** of sales.  People say "Oh!  *You* don't like the things that game does, but I think I very well might!  And since you're slamming it, I lend more authority to your opinion, because I feel its sincerity."<br/>
<br/>
So if the idea is "Let's trade positive reviews!" then yeah, I think it's transparently a bad idea.  It will neither generate healthy commentary nor generate sales.<br/>
<br/>
If the idea is "Let's trade insightful, honest reviews!" then that sounds like a spiffy idea.                        </div>

                            Graham, you are spot on as usual.  <br><br>The proof will be in the quality and objectivity of the reviews, of course, but I think even the most elegant and objective reviews have the potential for negative consequences if they are perceived as mutual back-scratching.  It just seems to cross an ethical boundary for me, and I worry that those good intentions will create some problems down the road.                        </br></br></div>

                            People seem committed to the idea of the reviews, so I don't think it's going to stop. Perhaps some body of rules addressing these kinds of issues could be made a part of the review exchange? What, exactly, I don't know. Maybe just a standard notification text in the review itself?                        </div>

                            Hi guys.<br><br>No offense taken at this thread; I understand the motives completely. That's why it wasn't just set up as a "you review my game, I review yours" scenario - the idea was to have a "chain" of reviewers so that the next person in line reviews your game, with no possibility of reciprocity.<br><br>Also, for me, there was no chance of preexisting relationships tainting the review, because of all the people here I think I've only ever met Jared Sorenson. I realize that might not be the case for others.<br/><br/>When I reviewed DRYH, I thought it was honestly a very good game - it's not only mechanically tight, it's right up my alley. I've become a fan of JAGS Wonderland, Unknown Armies, and other such things recently, and have always loved Doom Patrol. When someone reviews my game, I'm not expecting the same sort of reaction. I, too, want people to be honest about it.<br/><br/>A standard notification doesn't sound like a bad thing to me. Anyone want to draft one?<br/><br/>--Colin                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think the chain is a great idea.  It certainly helps to cut out the perception of that recitivism.<br/><br/>Also, I think mutliple reviews/comments are very worthwhile and shifts that perception, no?  When I had a store I had a "game of the week."  I reviewed the game in full in a two page spread put into a binder and the binder was kept open on a rack under the story copy of the book displayed at the front of the store.  I mention this because I would have three of four other people write a paragraph about what they did or didn't like about the game including their own overall rating along side my own.  As such you, when you thumbed through the binder you could see what games I liked and why and what games they liked and why so you formulated an idea of who like what kind of games (no doubt this is the perseption on many reviewer sites).  I think passing a game around and posting shared reviews would really benefit a game designer.<br/><br/>Maybe a pool could be developed of folk here interested in playtesting and reviewing games.<br/><br/>Count me in <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>- Don                        </div>

That's true; there is, without a doubt, going to be <i>somebody</i> who assumes this is just a bunk of old-boy-network mutual appreciation. The question then becomes: does the benefit of having a (good, impartial, accurate) review reach X number of people outweigh the disadvantage of having Y number of people think the whole thing is a put-up job, where we can only estimate X and Y? I think that's something everyone will have to answer individually, based on their perceptions of their games and markets.                        </div>

Chain is good, sure. Chain limits participation somewhat, but maybe that's a good thing too, in that it provides pacing. Better to start small than to suddenly flood review sites with a bunch of reviews of the same thing.                        </div>

                            Full disclosure is definitely the way to go, as others have said. People will get angry, and justifiably so, if there is a hidden level they're not privy to. This way, they can ignore or interpret at leisure.<br/><br/>Do I like the entire idea? Well, I really want to see more impartial reviews of indie games by the indie community (I've already said so in the <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/marginalia.php?entry=243&amp;comment=7878" rel="nofollow">Lumpley Kerfuffle thread</a>), and though I'm not entirely comfortable with this "doing reviews to get credit to ultimately get exposure for your own game" approach, it does get things a little further on. As is, we only get indie community members reviewing when they already like the game and want to push it forward (which is totally to be expected); via this review group, we will see informed reviews by people who may not enjoy the game, even if they may soften the criticism because of group and norming pressures.                        </div>
