Mike S. ran FreeMarket for Alex, Jackson, and myself, which I'd been wanting to try for a long time. We spent several hours scrabbling to get our subscription-based virtual-party-memory business off the ground, with, uh, mixed results. In the Saturday evening slot, I played Remember Tomorrow with Blake and Jackson, which I'm enjoying more every time I play it. I'm still figuring out how best to teach it, but once everyone has a handle on how it works, I really like the way it angles the characters at each other.<br/><br/>I also really liked having a fair amount of relaxed hangout time - a little time before everything started, a long break for dinner, etc. I wish that I could've made it back on Sunday - hopefully nemomeme will host another one next year. Many thanks to him for hosting, and to everyone else for coming out!

They were a family of bounty hunters, vying for a big score against their archrivals in a city of towers under siege by an army of fiends.  Their characters were great: the veteran aunt who ended up riding a batasaur; the drunk uncle who charged into danger with his huge sword and bare chest; and the young nephew who inherited the pair of magical pistols, who didn't think he was worthy (until the end of the game, when he took the "not" out of his "I'm not worthy of the family legacy" trait).  I greatly enjoyed it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Later on Saturday I played the Battlestar Galactica board game with Matthew, Brendan, Johnzo and David.  Man, that was one of my favorite board game experiences of all time.  The game itself is brilliant, replicating the mistrust issues of the series and the struggle to balance all of the dwindling resources against each other under constant threat of cylon attacks, with base ships bombarding the Galactica and centurions boarding it.  Nobody trusted Gaius, who turned out to be a human, while Saul Tigh -- our Admiral in charge of the nukes -- was revealed to be a cylon, as well as the chief.  And even though Roslin, Starbuck and Gaius fought off centurions and made a crazy jump that could have cost us half the remaining fleet, in the end, the cylons starved us to death before we could make our final getaway.  It was an epic game, and there's much to be learned from this game in terms of design, pacing, competing use of resources, tough choices, etc.  I sure hope I'll get to play it again soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324986/#Comment_324986" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T15:18:15+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  3:18PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christian already took mine!<br/><br/>I'll just say that Anima Prime is SUCH A COOL GAME, YOU GUYS. I can't believe it took me this long to play a second session, and Christian made it clear that he's gotten the system to the point where it really sings now.  I'm going to start practicing to run it soon.  I had a ton of fun as the half-clockwork-cyborg aunt with my charge/super combo strike powers.<br/><br/>Matthew and I had played the BSG game several times last year as part of a semi-regular group, and it had been a while since I felt the fresh sting of horrible, crushing mass human death.  (I always try so hard to be the Cylon and I NEVER AM.)  It was great to try it with people new to the game, and see the highs and lows of the system at full effect.  I know David was a little bothered by the fact that he got assigned to be a Cylon and then couldn't really figure out from the rulebook what he could do, but he was very successful in destroying us anyway.<br/><br/>I knew I had a Lady Blackbird game coming up Monday night, so on Sunday I wheedled Matthew and David into some more story-free stuff: first a couple games of Seven Wonders, then a couple more of Dominion. I did way better than usual, culminating in <a href="http://yfrog.com/h0lzlcmj" rel="nofollow">a killing-machine Dominion deck</a> like none I have ever assembled or likely ever will again.<br/><br/>Also, for the record, Jackson's head fits into a child-size scooter helmet and he is a very courteous back-seat rider.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325018/#Comment_325018" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T20:13:27+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  8:13PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh no - I wasn't bothered by it in a bad way.

The story began on the sepulchrous shore of the Sea of Gibbets, meandered to the Island of Mad Jesters and through the southern sea to the final showdown with the Plague King at the City of Lepers.  The highlight for me was having Kor-Gozar the Just, Last of the Zedraqi, completely betray his principles in order to finagle the downtrodden masses of Shantytown into invading the City of Lepers.  "Oh, the leprosy is  JUST A LIE.  Really.  You'll all be fine."  After Kor-Gozar succeeded brilliantly, one of the facts established from the victory was "All these people will fester and die a horrible, slow death."

I made a quote board, put up little signs naming each of the gaming spaces after a different Nautilus room and threw up that bulletin board.  The way it was supposed to work is that people would put what they were willing to run in each of the top slots and what they might be interested in playing in the bottom slots to try to help organize the chaos.  But people mostly went off the wiki and the "pitch-your-game-right-before-the-session-starts thing."<br/><br/>I've never really been a con guy.  I've been to Gamestorm four times, GPNW three times and Dreamation twice.  That's it.  So I don't/didn't know what the hell I was doing.  I don't know if I'd go more or even less organized next time but I'll definitely give it more thought and get some input from others.<br/><br/>I was inspired by a birthday mini-con that Johnzo had done in the spring up in Seattle and wanted to do something similar.  My concept was a Story Games version of the very early days of Alan Moon's "Gathering of Friends" (minus the part where the organizer is a brilliant, prolific game designer).  At the few cons I've been to, and on the forums here, some complain they don't get to spend enough time just talking to friends.  I wanted to create an intimate environment where the gaming schedule was really relaxed, people <i>mostly</i> knew each other (but not entirely!) and folks could spend a long time talking between games.<br/><br/>I invited people from Vancouver B.C., Seattle, Olympia, Eugene, S.F. and Portland that I knew and had either gamed with a few times or that I knew and had never gotten to game with.  The turnout wasn't what I hoped or had room for but I still had a wonderful time and want to try it again.  I'd probably put it earlier in May if I were try it again next year.  Further from the new Fabricated Realities, which I think I was competing with for regional folks free weekends, but still sufficiently distant from Gamestorm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325418/#Comment_325418" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T22:09:14+00:00" title="May 19, 2011 10:09PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a pretty damn fabulous experience.

The night slot featured a slick and stylish Remember Tomorrow game with Jackson and Harry, a story on which my creativity eventually foundered from sheer late night brain stupor.  Fortunately, Jackson ended things with a bang.<br/><br/>That said, the true highlights for me were social.  I think I talked more to folks there than at GPNW.  A lot more.  Way cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325419/#Comment_325419" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T22:19:04+00:00" title="May 19, 2011 10:19PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My burning jealousy is only eclipsed by my bitter regret.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325586/#Comment_325586" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T22:07:18+00:00" title="May 20, 2011 10:07PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2011 10:09PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After starting this thread, I haven't even had a chance to chime in on how awesome all the games were. I was flat-out three for three:<br/><br/><b>City of Lepers / On Mighty Thews</b> -- Admiral Idir &amp; Kor-Gozar destroying the City of Lepers and reaping their vengeance (with a little help from Laten the Wise) was a fine time. I mean c'mon, who doesn't want to purge a city of arrogant, bureaucratic lepers? It's automatically on my to-do list. We spun around a bit with the rules, but roleplaying the polite but less-than heroic rogue opposite the two booming heroes was sweet.<br/><br/><br/><b>Capes &amp; Cthulu / Microscope</b> -- Saturday night I played an awesome Microscope game with Alex, Joel and Mike. We start off with the standard "superheroes undermine the rule of law" history seed. We have no idea it's going to emerge that not only did all superheroes get their powers from the same mysterious source, but that same source is the entity periodically controlling the minds of supers and making them do terrible things. Like destroying Europe.<br/><br/>Oh, and that mysterious, unseen entity lurks sunken in depths of the Pacific, Cthulhu-style. Where's your due process now?<br/><br/>Awesome game all around, even when Cthulhu wasn't involved. Lots and lots of great scenes and characters.<br/><br/><br/><b>Art for the Star / Shock</b> -- It was a sleepy Sunday when Joel, Jackson, Alex and I sat down to play, but despite driving the con entirely over the time limit by about a zillion hours we rocked our issues and made some scathing sci fi. Our issues were Need for Faith, Legality of Art, Privilege and Plagiarism, and we came up with a Shock of humanity finding a strange star that some people could commune with, but only when in the right mental state, which turned out to be letting yourself go and making abstract art. Unfortunately this growing cult of "star-loving artists" is interfering with the master plan to study the star's energy patterns and build duplicates in other star systems. Damn hippies!<br/><br/>For speed we only did two protagonists (so each player was either a protagonist or antagonist, not both) and we had some great domino bits, with one protagonist's story creating consequences for the other -- putting the artist/believers in camps, Jackson's protagonist getting burned by the luddite mob which spurred the jihad or, y'know, killing 90% of the world population with lethal solar flares.<br/><br/>Joel's protagonist was about the Need for Faith, and I have to admit, I pounded on that issue like a 5 lb hammer in a metric screw world. Bitter domestic arguments over her new-found beliefs (and new-found friends), riot police cracking down on the artist-believers, the terrified survivors of the genocidal solar flares doubling-down on fanaticism and fear, spinning all the way up to a stellar jihad. Accept the love of the Blessed Star or burn. Joel rolled the dice to stop the jihad (three times actually) but no luck. Tamar had to console herself that all the evils done in the star's name didn't reflect the real love it wanted to share.<br/><br/>Also, Alex as the rogue scientist Dr. Baths: lovely. So sorry he only lived for one scene, because he was a great conversationalist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325653/#Comment_325653" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-21T19:40:46+00:00" title="May 21, 2011  7:40PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On Mighty Thews - Best Quote:<br/><br/>"They were whimsy killings, not political."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327816/#Comment_327816" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T12:35:33+00:00" title="June  5, 2011 12:35PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            re: Capes and Cthulhu<br/>\n<br/>\nThis paragraph gave me a headache - of the good sort. Just sent the following email to a friend of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n...dear sweet baby Nyarlathotep, I have just seen  a forum post that's given me the best idea for an "origin of superpowers" backstory thingy ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if... all superpowers come from the same source?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if... the source is Cthulhu (unknown to all)?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if... when the stars are ALMOST in alignment, dreaming Cthulhu starts calling in his chips?<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine - the heroes occasionally start doing awful things and not knowing why. Eventually someone realizes what's going on. Using their powers puts them ever further under the sway of Cthulhu, but without using them, how can they hope to defeat the Great Old One?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
