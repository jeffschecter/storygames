It doesn't have to be D&amp;D;, even though Arneson's Blackmoor campaign was where Gary Gygax learned how to play the game that later became Dungeons and Dragons. Whenever you take the role of a character having adventure in an imagined world where your fate is determined by the roll of a dice, you're celebrating Arneson's legacy. To quote Ben Robbins, "<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/104/braunstein-the-roots-of-roleplaying-games/" rel="nofollow">You may think of Dave Arneson as one of the godfathers of GMing, but even before that he was the godfather of players. He was, literally, the proto-player.</a>"<br/>\n<br/>\nFor <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=40971&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">last year's memorial</a> I posted <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=286043" rel="nofollow">Spinachcat's description of playing in one of Dave Arneson's games</a> as a guide to what we're celebrating when we honor his contributions, but his daughter Malia Weinhagen <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dave-arneson11-2009apr11,0,1919042.story" rel="nofollow">says it more universally</a>:<br/>\n<br/>\n"The biggest thing about my dad's world is he wanted people to have fun in life," Weinhagen said.

The most legendary and fabled castle of them all, Castle Zagyg materializes from a dread fog that has long held it enthralled and thus averting its many seekers. As your party emerges from the tangled brush, briers, and vines that fence the Old Castle Track, you observe the sprawling ruins of an enormous castle complex built upon a sloping bluff of rock. Crumbling, battlemented walls join towers square, round, and pentagonal. Gatehouses, courtyards, and craft shops lie in varying states of disrepair. High above the ruins, at the culmination of the bluff, rise two impressive towers: one round, the other hexagonal. The great east towers flank an enormous fortress of stone from which carved spires rise, piercing the very sky. This edifice can be none other than Castle Zagyg, the dwelling of the Mad Archmage.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Recommended for: Folks who want to revisit (or experience for the first time) the glories of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1E and adventure in Gary Gygax's final contribution to the castle-and-dungeon genre pioneered by Arneson's Blackmoor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="PastedGraphic-1%20%281%29.tif" class="bbcode_img" src="https://sites.google.com/site/dwimmermountplayers/_/rsrc/1267470051324/temple-of-the-frog/PastedGraphic-1%20%281%29.tif"/><br/>\nGame Name: Temple of the Frog (4e)<br/>\n<br/>\nRun By: George Strayton<br/>\n<br/>\nMaximum Players: 6<br/>\n<br/>\nScenario: For centuries, the tangled maze of sluggish watercourses, stagnant ponds, and festering marshes known as the Great Dismal Swamp has defended Blackmoor's southwestern frontier. Recently, both large armies and smaller parties have disappeared altogether inside its vast, dripping, claustrophobic corridors. But great treasures are said to lie hidden within a secret and weird temple at the heart of the morass and so you and your companions have decided to leave the comforts and safety of civilization behind. Deep into the fetid swamp you must go -- far from sunlight and sanity -- there to find...the TEMPLE OF THE FROG.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters: Bring your own 12th level PC or use one of the pregenerated characters provided at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecommended For: 4th Edition players who want to experience 1st edition feel or OD&amp;D;/1st edition players who want to see how 4e can be used as an old-school system.<br/>\n<img alt="6817.jpeg?attredirects=0" class="bbcode_img" src="https://sites.google.com/site/dwimmermountplayers/logos/6817.jpeg?attredirects=0"/><br/>\n<img alt="dd-sup2-9.jpeg" class="bbcode_img" src="https://sites.google.com/site/dwimmermountplayers/_/rsrc/1267469927924/blackmoor/dd-sup2-9.jpeg"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="PZOPSS0000-1E_180.jpeg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPSS0000-1E_180.jpeg"/><br/>\nGame Name: The Pallid Plague (Pathfinder)<br/>\n<br/>\nRun By: Mark Moreland<br/>\n<br/>\nMaximum Players: 6<br/>\n<br/>\nScenario: Reports from Andoran's Darkmoon Vale indicate that a new plague is causing the deaths of untold fey.

Over the years there have been many changes in the layout and makeup of the Dungeon. These maps comprise the ones used over the first five years... The first six levels of encounters were prepared for the last two years for convention games, and set up along 'Official' D&amp;D; lines. The last (7th - 9th &amp; tunnel Cavern system) are the originals used in our game... Each of the regular exit/entrances from the Dungeon are heavily guarded by Elves armed with Holy Water Hoses, and other anti-Evil charms plus an Elven Prince and two Elven lords! So, if you can reach a door and are still good, the pursuit will break off..." - Dave Arneson, <i>The First Fantasy Campaign</i>, 1977<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Characters</b>: Characters will be rolled at the table - both at the start of play and whenever existing characters succumb to fate! Like the Dungeon itself, we will use a mix of old and new rules - or, to modern eyes, very old (1974's <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, aka OD&amp;D;) and unimaginably ancient (a reconstruction of the pre-D&amp;D; house rules, soon to be released as <i>Dragons at Dawn</i> by by Southerwood Publishing).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Recommended For</b>: Gamers who want to experience the dungeon that led to actual play reports like this one: "While we battled (and Sweeney worked his way forward) ten of the fifty ran off. Soon after, thirty hit us in the rear as well. The battle was fierce with wounds exchanged rapidly on both sides, but when Sweeney appeared up front, again the orcs ran off. Arneson stated: 'Sweeney, in a whirlwind, has just killed 17 orcs in this melee round'".
