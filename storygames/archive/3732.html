If you want, just skip down to questions A) and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> at the bottom.<br/><br/>I am currently working on a tabletop RPG entitled "Verses," which is designed to be multi-genre and heavy on the narrative.  Character sheets consist of little more than sets of sentences and descriptions of the character, combined with associated numerical ranks.  The mechanic involves small dice pools (any size dice will work) and a bit of token management.<br/><br/>Anyway, one of the central elements to the system are Traits, of which every "Lead Role" character has at least six.  Each Trait is a sentence about the character, and inherent to its establishment is a necessity that it be "double-edged" - that is, it must be able to be applied to situations in both positive and negative fashions.  Characters get bonus dice to their actions by "pumping" their Traits (i.e. using them beneficially), and they give their opponent extra dice by "detrimenting" their Traits (i.e. using them against themselves).<br/><br/>As far as the system is concerned, a good Trait implies a wealth of possibilities, abilities, experiences, and/or relationships.  Some examples of Traits from various playtest sessions:<br/><br/>"I am the greatest and most notorious tomb robber of all time"<br/>"I fly this ship when the captain is too high to do it."<br/>"Not being from around here, I miss out on subtleties, but often notice things that others fail to perceive."<br/>"I am a consummate charlatan, and damn good at it."<br/>"I am possessed of the strength of a sturdy fat man."<br/>"I am a phenomenal liar, yet I tend to get carried away when on a good roll."<br/><br/>The idea to implement this system of what I've been calling "double-edged traits" is mostly rooted in my appreciation for the "perks and flaws" systems of many major RPGs, combined with my distaste for their usual implementations.  All too often I see two rather awful things happen with character flaws purchased at creation - either the flaw is paid for once and then promptly forgotten, or the player eventually finds out that the flaw wasn't worth the piddling amount of starting points and has to deal with it for the rest of the game.  In many cases of the latter, I've even seen GMs who were thoroughly steadfast in their refusal to let the character earn back the flaw, buying it off through experience and lessons learned.<br/><br/>Some of these various cases will stem from players just looking to min-max, and such tends to be apt punishment.  But more often than not, I've seen it happen simply because the players were either unfamiliar with the system, or hadn't fully grasped a greater character concept in the limited pre-game devlopment time set by the GM.<br/><br/>My intention is to work towards preventing things like that from happening.  Every Trait should imply ability and/or other empowerment within the narrative, and inherent to each statement is a core conflict upon which those empowerments are built.<br/><br/>Now to my actual point in all of this.  I'm fairly new to story gaming, and loving the ideas I've picked up so far.  They've greatly changed my games, and only for the better (and for that, guys, I'm eternally grateful). To better help me get my mind wrapped around how to tailor these systems to be more versatile, I ask you:<br/><br/>A) What are you preferences for systemic character flaws in your games?  Do you prefer to use them for extra points in perks, a la Shadowrun, Alternity, WoD, and other systems?  Do you prefer instead to be driven to actually <i>spend</i> character points on them, such as in Burning Wheel, wherein negative traits are sought out because they can get you artha?  Or something entirely different?<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> What are your thoughts on the idea of these Traits described above,  from which a broad wealth of ability and background can be implied, with inherent double-edged uses?  Have you played in other systems which did things in a similar fashion?  What were your experiences with those systems?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83729/#Comment_83729" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T19:10:40+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  7:10PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the livejournal is getting all the love because here, the post is prefaced with [Verses].

SOTC's actually vastly un-complicated, but it dresses itself up in complex clothing.  But 90% of the book is a direct derivation of the core 10%, so I tend to think of Fate's *engine* as only about a 40 page thing.    Dresden Files RPG's going to be more actually complex, but will try to combat that by lifting up the hood and explaining how certain pieces parts are put together (there'll be some custom stunt building guidelines, frex).  Once we get past that, to Fate 3.0, we won't just  be lifting the hood -- we're going to disassemble the vehicle, show you each part, and show you how to build each part for what you want.  And in case that's not your bag, we're also going to provide a bunch of pre-built parts that you can snap together easily without having to worry about coming up with your own stuff.  Very much in the 2.0 spirit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84054/#Comment_84054" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T09:46:41+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  9:46AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More self-promotion:<br/><br/><em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> has "thematic batteries" which players 'charge' by giving themselves a penalty so that they can later 'discharge' them and give themselves a bonus.
