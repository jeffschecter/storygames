If during a combat scene the players seem to be in danger of a TPK, the GM can lay their token on the map and offer a deal. The deal is always "You escape, but ..." with the player characters losing something. <br/><br/>So, say the party's cleric takes a tumble, and the others are quickly running out of hit points. The DM slides a coin onto the table and says "You escape, but you leave the cleric behind." Anyone at the table can take the token, including the guy/gal playing the cleric. The heroes automatically escape to the next room, and whoever takes the token narrates the escape. So lets say, in this initial example, the cleric player grabs the escape token, forcing all the other players out of the room and leaving his character behind. He can describe the other characters grappling with the fighter, dragging him out of the room as the goblins surround the fallen cleric, the scramble to spike the door as the goblins try to get at the adventurers,etc. The cleric is still alive, but now the player characters must regroup and (hopefully) go back after him.<br/><br/>The players also have tokens, which allow them to offer an escape deal to the DM. For example, same fight as above, but this time the Fighter slides a token onto the mat and says "We escape, but I lose my sword." The DM can take or not take the deal, or other players can put their own tokens into play and offer deals. Again, even the guy who got knocked out can offer a deal. If no one accepts any of the deals, the tokens come off the table and the fight continues.<br/><br/>The tokens really are only meant to give a physical representation to the deal, and indicate who gets to narrate the outcome of the deal.<br/><br/>ME                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Apeiron" title="Apeiron"><img alt="Apeiron" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Apeiron">Apeiron</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175055/#Comment_175055" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T07:13:25+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  7:13AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i've something that does this and a bit more: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://base.googlehosted.com/base_media?q=hand9059148388427868484&amp;size=8" rel="nofollow">Coin of Fortune</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works for individual players, for characters or the whole group.

I've seen a lot of attempts to hack 4E such that you can avoid actually playing through combat, either due to boredom or disinclination to see the outcome. But, combat is almost everything that 4E really does. Isn't the real problem in your case the implied stakes? "Win or play is massively disrupted or ended" seems to be the implied stakes of the combat, and that's kind of problematic if you want smooth play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175109/#Comment_175109" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T16:39:07+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  4:39PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea, and I can imagine it being useful.  Sometimes a fight is dragging on, or the outcome is immediately obvious, or it's miscalculated.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the tokens add to this idea.  Here's a similar idea, that kind of cribs from "Raising the Stakes":<br/><br/>Before every round of combat (including the first) the players and the GM are allowed to make offers.  For example, at the start of the fight, a player might offer "The goblins run away - we win, but we might have to fight them later".  Or the GM might offer "You retreat, unharmed, but the goblin scout will follow you".  Later in the fight, when the odds become more clear, the offers can become more one-sided.  The players might offer "We win, and kill them all except one who runs to warn the others", or the GM might offer "You lose, and are captured by the goblins."  Players and GMs can offer healing surges and action points as part of an offer.  "We win, but the fighter loses a couple of healing surges".  Or "You escape, but you'll lose an action point each".  Offers can also mention specific characters, like "You escape but the cleric gets captured" or "We win, but the fighter gets killed".  In all cases, there's no obligation to take an offer.  The players have to be unanimous to take an offer. <br/><br/>I can see this playing out a bit like that bit in Fellowship of the Ring, where Gandalf falls into the pit, and the others escape.  They've paid the price, we don't need to see what happens after that.  I like the idea that you might get an offer that seems really tempting, and decide to risk another round of combat, which changes the situation for the better or for the worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175115/#Comment_175115" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T19:02:40+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  7:02PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>But, combat is almost everything that 4E really does.</blockquote>\nTraditional RPGs are really are nothing but combat systems.

Using a device to help create a story from an encounter (rather than the other way around) would work well for them.<br/>As usual, this leaves me confused. If you weren't interested in minis combat with a side of ad-hoc story, why were you playing 4E to begin with? This isn't the bad old days, we have games now that just do story-centric fantasy adventure if that's what you want, right?<br/><br/>I mean, some people just like turning a pile of stuff into something else, modding cars to run on old socks or turning a lot of beer cans into a working peltier effect generator, so I can understand it on that level. But, if you've got a hamburger and you realize you wanted a salad, I'm inclined to suggest just ordering a salad. If you've got a hamburger and realize you wanted a cheeseburger, then this makes sense, but now we're back to Willow's original confusion: are TPK scenarios really that frequent in your 4E games? If so, it's probably a good idea to discuss the context around that a bit more first. Are you deliberately playing a higher-threat game with over-leveled challenges, for example? Are you frequently running encounters that expose badly-balanced bits of the system?<br/><br/>edit: So, basically, we've have been presented with a tool by our comrade, and I'm curious about the context in which the tool was developed so as to better understand the tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175148/#Comment_175148" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T05:36:11+00:00" title="October 16, 2008  5:36AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you don't have trouble with TPKs in your game, or you don't feel the need to add a storytelling element to your 4E game, then you wouldn't care for my idea. Fair enough.<br/><br/>In several 4E games I've played, we've gotten into combat encounters that have gone bad. Usually through some DM fudging the party survived, but there was a level of frustration by the players (and sometimes the DM) that you had to keep fighting until you either won or lost. Also, if the DM doesn't figure the threat level correctly or over-estimates the ability of the players/characters, you can end up with a very one-sided fight in either direction. <br/><br/>The Escape Tokens aren't meant to "solve a problem," but rather are intended to give DMs and players a fun little tool to liven up a combat encounter that seems to be going downhill. I think I made a mistake of mentioning TPK, because that seems to be what everyone is focusing on. You also could have an encounter where the DM purposefully has the villains outclass the PCs, but gives them the chance of escape just to add a new story element.<br/><br/>I love 4E. Not trying to fix anything. This was just an idea I was kicking around.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175152/#Comment_175152" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T05:57:39+00:00" title="October 16, 2008  5:57AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've encountered the same problem (fight till you win or lose) in many games with a combat focus.

That kind of stupidity/devotion should be rare.  i recommend that a DM plan scenes, rather than battles.  "You come upon a group of orcs, they appear to be on the move".  This gives the players a chance to avoid a fight.  They can let the orcs pass, or attempt to parlay.  Let the bard have a crack at negotiating, build a battle of wits ala Burning Wheel.  Make surrender a real option for both sides.  Combat should be a serious matter.  Don't be afraid to let PCs die.
