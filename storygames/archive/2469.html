                    Yesterday my group tried out Polaris for the first time and had an absolute blast. I can honestly say that particular session was one of the best roleplaying expereinces I've every had. Unfortunately, now we all are sad we didn't record the actual play for posterity! <br/><br/>So I present the question to my fellow Story-gamers: Does anyone have experience with a nice microphone they could recommend I use to pick up table talk as we play? I'd like to hook it up to my MacBook Pro, that way I could edit the raw audio on my computer and covert it to mp3 right there. Something in the $40 to $75 range would fall right into my impluse buy range, though I might be talked into something more sophisticated if it's a really nice piece of equipment.<br/><br/>Otherwise a small, portable, digital recording device could work as well if it's USB or Firewire compatable.<br/><br/>Our next session is in two weeks, which should be enough time to pick something up before then.<br/><br/>--<br/>Vasco                </div>

                            Sound Professionals make a good T-stick single point stero mic:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.soundprofessionals.com/cgi-bin/gold/item/SP-SPSM-13" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.soundprofessionals.com/cgi-bin/gold/item/SP-SPSM-13</a><br/><br/>Sony also has a model like this for about 20 bucks less, but with cheaper components.<br/><br/>I use one of these on my minidisc to get ambiences and meetings. I recommend stereo because it will capture a wide range of sources and then let you use the natural panorama of the sound to help determine one source from another.<br/><br/>This may be more prosumer than you have in mind.                        </div>
