The Death Stars and whatnot would still be there, but only as incidental inspirations and examples of what may be done. The game would probably devote only a few pages to setting, and even there it'd probably mostly focus on a bibliography and filmography, discussing the differences and creative choices made in prior Star Wars fiction; the goal would be to prepare the reader to make their own music, not just to replicate faithfully a setting that does not in fact have an a priori existence detached from a given story.<br/><br/>I would, of course, provide the basic mechanical support for jedi powers, droids and all that sort of thing. The mechanical basis would probably be one of dramatic adventure - in fact, if I had to work under a deadline and just get a good game out quickly, I would personally probably work with the Solar System just because it totally can do it and I already know how to make it work. I would resist the temptation to make the game narrow and strongly structural in nature; better to provide tools and procedures for taking on the whole menagerie of setting and ideas that's been created for the Star Wars brand over the years. Loose enough rules so that they can be used equally well for replicating the style of the '80s comics, '90s novels and recent movies. A substantial part of the product would consist of ready-made adventure and campaign frameworks to show the reader how to do it. Some of this material would be explicitly counterfactual as regards the "canon", the flagship campaign would probably be something along the lines of doing the original movies without the original cast. It would all be very explicit about not getting any more hung up about setting consistency and pre-established canon than the original creators were. An important part of the work would be to encourage the reader and the gaming group to learn about the subject matter and enjoy using it in play: implied references to pre-existing works, clever cross-overs, smart choices in what to use and what to discard, this is what creativity on the basis of existing culture (which is all creativity, when you come down to it) is all about.<br/><br/>As might be expected, the above is pretty much how I would do a Middle-Earth roleplaying game or an Arthurian roleplaying game, too: provide the aesthetic components or at least source references, provide analytic tools for understanding how to replicate the style and the feel, provide a gaming engine that can do adventurous drama, and then leave it for the gamers to apply the stuff. I've never seen truly satisfying licenced-world gaming happen by offering endless amounts of setting canon for reference, with neurotic rules for replicating that one event in that one movie; the magic is definitely in encouraging creativity inspired by the original work. If that should result in a "Luke Starkiller" or "Skywalker Paradigm" or a campaign where Ewoks do not exist, where's the harm?<br/><br/>(As might be imagined, I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder about roleplayers putting their faith and hope in magically satisfying genre gaming by throwing more study and less creative honesty at it. It's a particularly annoying blind point when a license-based roleplaying game is again and again interpreted to mean a game that allows you to be a pedantic jerk about a setting on the basis of pre-existing texts instead of making the choices that are right for your game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305704/#Comment_305704" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T09:08:26+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  9:08AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For years and years I've toyed around with various hacks and homebrew systems for Star Wars, but keep coming back to the classic D6 system. It worked well enough, but could stand for some major rules simplification (to get that feel of just being concerned about the heroes and major villains, and everything else are just cameos, extras, props, or window dressing). And fixing the Force rules.<br/><br/>One system I was seriously considering hacking was <i>Feng Shui</i>. It was the game that, perhaps, best represented the action and heroics and banter of the original Star Wars movies, and even more so with the action scenes of the newer movies and video games. Seriously, the rules for Sorcery in <i>Feng Shui</i> would've ported BEAUTIFULLY into the Force.<br/><br/>Another that I thought about, particularly for a grittier, Episode 4 style game, would be the <i>Barbarians of Lemuria</i> system. Particularly with the way they deal with occupations and combat abilities, they keep it simple, and still keep the flexible feel of advancement, so that a scoundrel can eventually become a General in the Rebellion, and a farmboy can eventually become a Jedi Knight. Its magic system also would work well as the Force in a Force-light campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305706/#Comment_305706" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T09:30:24+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  9:30AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanically, I think I'd try to focus on Difficult Choices, Sacrifice, and Challenging Characters' Ethics, as those seem to be the primary themes. I think that's why DitV gets drifted to SW so often and easily--tough moral decisions and the authority to make them stick. But DitV isn't a PERFECT match, in my opinion, because the characters are not challenged by its play, the players are (after all, the PCs are Immaculate [in the Catholic sense]).<br/><br/>For Force mechanics, I'd look to emphasize Trust and Will versus Fear and Temptation--maybe something like opposed attributes on tracks or similar.<br/><br/>Definitely want some mechanical benefit for color and creative narration--that's how all the "gee whiz" scenes come about, all the little touches of cleverness or spectacle. Fan Mail (PTA) and/or Feat Dice (Exalted) seem to be the main ways that such narration is incentivized.<br/><br/>I'd probably (mechanically) de-emphasize blasters, lightsabers, and ships. As I see it, they're all more-or-less equal, just specialized for particular arenas of conflict. It's the rare (and, thus, frequently noted/emphasized) item that is better than the run-of-the-mill: the Millenium Falcon is the fastest of her kind; Darth Maul's saber-staff is (was, before all the Jedi porn) frightening and potent, allowing him to handle a Jedi Master and his nearly fully trained Padawan with relative ease; the Sun Crusher is the final word in solar system destruction (the end of a long line of otherwise-serviceable Star Destroyers, Battle Stations, and Death Stars). I see those as mechanical bumps (or maybe even trumps?), not the BFGs on laundry lists of stuff to buy, minimally distinguished by stat bonuses.<br/><br/>Finally, there's The Alien... and one really needn't hunt much further than Shock for mechanics to play out the weird and woolly encounters with both sapient NPCs and monsterous threats. Maybe some kind of bidding or buying process, a la Univerrsalis Facts, to initially generate the alien morphology and (thus) home world/climate and behaviors.<br/><br/>Fun concepts to ponder, actually! Every SW RPG has approached the property's mechanics with crunch and numbers, its action in the form of task resolution, and its diversity and variety as laundry lists of feats and traits. It would be nice to see a more narrative treatment that actually pushes for the themes (and thrills!) of the original trilogy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305707/#Comment_305707" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T09:34:23+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  9:34AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2010 9:35AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am intending to do this someday, and the main thing to me is to make it non-canonical, explicitly, like Luke did with Burning Sands Jiyhad which does for Dune what I want to do with SW. <br/><br/>I want to set aside annoying freak-outs or confusion due differing familiarity/passion for canon, and focus instead on what people like about Star Wars.

There would be a mechanic that encouraged dropping undefined but evocative words or phrases into conversation to make the setting seem deeper and richer than it actually is (e.g. Kessel, Clone Wars, Old Republic, etc., were just words on a list before someone worked them into dialog). Planets would be thinly sketched, and would be characterized entirely by the introductory visual (Desert! Ice! Swamp!). There might be a humor element where you could have characters that speak a language only you understand deliver a "line" that you could shape for the audience by selling your reaction to it. There would be no need to get the Star Wars license for this, and actually getting it would probably be harmful to the concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305718/#Comment_305718" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T10:35:25+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 10:35AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd pull out the zillions of SW CMG toys I have and then make the whole thing up ad-hoc, using bits and pieces from whatever games caught my imagination while at the table.

You have a certain number of attributes ranging from 1-9, and actions are completed by playing a card from your hand and adding the attribute to the base score. Difficulty ranges are roughly the same in both systems, so conversion would be easy. How SAGA handles experience is as you get experienced you get a larger hand, this doesn't increase your absolute top, but is roughly like going from 3d6 to 4d6-1 to 5d6-2, and with the trump suit mechanic it works pretty much as you'd expect a 3d6-&gt;4d6-1-&gt;5d6-2..etc system to work if it has exploding 6s.<br/><br/>Then the dark side comes in. If you play a dark side card (roughly equivalent to major arcana in frequency) it means you're drawing on the dark side, and the card you replace it with goes into a separate dark side hand, and this hand becomes automatically trump - making it very tempting from a power perspective. Each time you play a card from the dark side hand it increases by one, and if your dark side hand grows larger than your regular hand you become consumed by the dark side and turn into a villain. There would naturally be ways of whittling it down - for instance if playing an action from your regular hand would mean you fail, because the cards are all too low, but playing from the dark side hand would allow you to succeed, if you resist temptation you get to discard one dark side card, and slowly get back control (of course you fail, so there are consequences). <br/><br/>This ends up making a very real seeming and interesting battle between the light side and dark side, and rather than just having points that you draw on, you constantly have a visual reminder of the struggle in the cards you're holding.<br/><br/>Also, the WEG system of having mechanics as a base attribute takes into account what the game is about, and the SAGA system integrates well into it (probably Marvel would work better given the modern nature). Sorcery &amp; Mysticism also translate well into the force, particularly with the extended universe featuring Jedi with specialities in different areas.<br/><br/>Alternatively: A square grid combat focused system as a great excuse to use Lego Star Wars figs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305756/#Comment_305756" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T12:28:19+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 12:28PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2010 12:51PM by Scott.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>But DitV isn't a PERFECT match, in my opinion, because the characters are not challenged by its play, the players are (after all, the PCs are Immaculate [in the Catholic sense]).</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07790a.htm" rel="nofollow">Infallible</a> is the word your looking for.  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htm" rel="nofollow">Immaculate</a> is used for something all together different (just celebrated that one last week).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305764/#Comment_305764" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T13:23:28+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  1:23PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's a huge space between a "Star Wars RPG" and "an RPG that takes place in the Star Wars universe."<br/><br/>The Star Wars MMO had this same problem -- folks wanted to be major movers and shakers, Jedi, Sith, whomever, but instead spent their time doing MMOish things like building blasters and selling bantha hides.<br/><br/>I'd probably start with the same creative premise as Burning Empires: The dial is set on "you are the most important people in the universe" and, with some work, you can dial it down from there.<br/><br/>Personally I don't think I'd have much fun playing in or running a sandbox-y, poke-around-and-be-a-tourist type Star Wars game. Just like I'd rather play a Knight of the Round Table and all that implies, than just some person in the same time and place as Avalon, where all the good shit is going down.<br/><br/>Social mechanics would be huge in my SW game, some method to win people over at least temporarily. I'd also make sure every character had some defining, even crippling, flaw, or perhaps some profound need that one pursues, by default, in a really petty, crippling way. "What the characters want" would totally trump "what the characters can do" in my SW game.<br/><br/>Keeping with Lucas' own aesthetic, I'd probably come up with some way to make up the Force's capabilities as you play, rather than a list of powerz. There'd be some fundamental truths to it, like the fact that using the Force in the pursuit of certain "good" motives looks different than using the Force in pursuit of certain "bad" motives. The motives might feed into a recharge mechanism in some sort of reinforcing cycle: you have a "light" and "dark" battery, and they both enable the Force powers in the same way, but doing "good" stuff when you use the FOrce recharges the "light" battery and doing "bad" stuff recharges the "dark" battery. Something like that. Totally spitballing.<br/><br/>The Force could be strong in people and those people might not even know it, in-fiction. Out-of-fiction it might represent "luck" or something, maybe also one's susceptibility to others' Force-powered efforts. No midicholorians, kthx.<br/><br/>I'm not persuaded you'd need subsystems for busting out blaster fights, lightsaber duels and/or dogfights. What works on-screen may not work in-game.<br/><br/>Defined factions, WOD splatbook-style, would probably help a lot to get players' heads into the setting. It's depressingly simplistic in the movies but man it does work in RPGs. Merchant League, Rebel Alliance, Imperium, Jedi Order, the Hutt, yadda yadda. Probably a package of obligations and resources that come with belonging to each.<br/><br/>Oh! A way to build out the setting's planets on-the-fly, which is how watching the old SW movies always felt to me. Oh hey, here's an asteroid field where caves are actually giant mouths, wild! Oh hey, this old Jedi teacher lives in an hallucinogenic swamp! And so on. Rather than providing a map full of details and facts. I liked when Han looked through his starmaps and came up with Bespin but, oh shit, he's got a pretty complicated relationship with the boss man there. Probably tie locations to NPCs, and it's a map of NPCs that you move between. And if there's *not* an NPC there (Bespin, Dagobah), there's gonna be some kind of complication (Hoth, asteroid field). <br/><br/>I'd spend a lot of time focusing on making sure the players are all bought into A Major Conflict of some kind, rather than the open-ended "let's tramp around space earning our fortune" thing that Traveller already does quite well. I guess this is me striving against the sandbox again.<br/><br/>The third area I think would really benefit from the make-it-up-as-you-go thing (the first couple being the Force, and the setting) would be the gear and vehicles and, I suppose, alien races. I'd love to capture that "whoa" you got the first time you saw big walking things stomping across the ice fields, and then seeing them reincorporated, sort of, on Endor via those two-legged jobbies. Or landspeeders! Or all the variations on TIE fighters. Or a light saber that has blades coming out both ends! Just like how an established star map would just feel like a huge canonical creativity sink to me, a big book o' gear would also feel like a huge drag. It might be funny/cynical to tie setting ephemera bloat into some kind of benefit for the GM -- the more crazy aliens and ships and guns you come up with, the better the GM is doing. Call it "licensing rights" or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think SW has never been done especially well and this is where I'd start. I'll let y'all know when Lucasarts and I have worked out the details. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305765/#Comment_305765" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T13:35:36+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  1:35PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2010 1:42PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like Star Trek has more room than Star Wars for new and interesting protagonists, personally. <br/>But, how about this - what do folks think? Is there really a strong interest in playing characters other than those in the films?<br/>With a famous character who's 900 years old lurking around (you know who), clearly if we want to actively ignore the content of the films, we're going to need to stay away from certain organizations, regions, etc. - how far away are the Jedi from this cluster of worlds, anyway?<br/><i>[edit: I just realized, eating some cheesecake, that the problem is Star Wars is so centered around some <i>wars</i> - if you walk away from those conflicts, is it still Star Wars?]</i><br/><br/>I really, really like Star Wars, but it's hard for me to imagine what kind of character I might (enjoy) play(ing) in such a game - the flipside is that playing major canonical characters would feel a bit too playgroundy, dare I say indulgent, to me. <br/>I feel like Dune or Trek would be more accessible, would provide more room for new protagonists and storylines. *shrug*<br/><br/>But I do really like where Paul's going with this - in <i>Star Wars</i>, relationships pin the whole universe together!

What is the Force really? No one knows but ancient masters who sit on high cliffs and speak in riddles. What makes a hero? The willingness to lose everything to make something. What makes a villain? The drive to sacrifice everything to own something. How fast does the ship go? 12 parsecs.</p>\n<p>Your character begins as a member of society (farmboy, diplomatic princess, member of the fraternity of smugglers), then is forced to leave society in order to exceed its expectations (your family is burned alive, your home is blown up, you get a bounty on your head). So you start by drawing your power from your place in society (or struggling against it \u2014\xa0same thing), then start to get called.</p>\n<p>Every time you use your calling, it makes it stronger, while making your place in society weaker, until the call itself is the tool for the job every time. Once that takes place, you start getting opportunities for choices (fuck your sister/friend's crush vs. getting out of their way, fuck your brother vs. fuck your friend, abandon your friends to safety vs. help them and get your ass tortured).</p>\n<p>Those choices build consequences, where each road taken, and each road not taken, still impact the characters' lives.</p>\n<p>Your character proportionately die and establish a legacy.

Episodes 4-6 are about redemption in the same model, though Luke himself isn't being redeemed, as he grows as a personal force of redemption, so the rebel alliance grows as a force against the empire. So I would give the players civilizations or factions to stat out, have everyone decide whether or not they favored a corruption or redemption tale, and then have them pull characters out of the created circumstances, stressing all the time classic mythological themes and tropes from pulp-era science fiction. There would need to be a protagonist, who represented the society as a whole, but maybe he would never be the PC, instead, the PCs would be all the people around him who shape him and shape the nature of his rise or fall. Also, lots of pre-discussion of what makes up the  "Star Wars" aesthetic for the group, maybe with a list of flavor/color points that people could drag and drop into the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305849/#Comment_305849" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T07:12:59+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  7:12AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2010 8:46AM by Cedric P.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since the prequels I am so sick of the force, the Jedi, prophecy and the fight of light VS darkness.

On the whole the result was satisfying, and now that I've worked out the kinks, I've got my go-to game for heroic Star Wars. <br/><br/>Edited to Add: <br/><br/>As far as specific mechanics:<br/><br/>1) The Force needs to be present as a force that permeates everything, mechanically this means that players should get the feeling that things a) happen for a reason, that b) the force ebbs and flows, and c) that the important characters literally have a destiny. In Homeworld Project the core mechanics have a built in dramatic flow, modified by the destinies of the characters, which ultimately shape the fate of the galaxy - for good or ill. <br/><br/>2) The key aspects (similar too, but not nearly as distinct as niches) of space opera need to apparent and potent. Homeworld Project does this using Panache, which combine to give a specific combination of tropes to characters and ships.<br/><br/>3) The narrative must be flexible to changes in and of characters. Homeworld Project enables the creation of "grains", which add pivotal elements to existing PCs and NPCs, which turns the NPCs into PCs, as well as resolving these grains to reshape the galaxy. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305958/#Comment_305958" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-26T07:31:57+00:00" title="December 26, 2010  7:31AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would probably start with not actually doing Star Wars; I would not want to be ham stringed with my non-religious devotion to all that is SW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next thing I would do is probably section things up like Fantasy Flights did with 40k.

I'd imagine the force powers would be modeled as Secrets, possibly in groups so players can effectively "unlock" them through play (I'm sure a quick look at any Star Wars game system would be a useful starting point for this).  Other genre-suitable feats would be Secrets as well- Secret of Wookie Strength, etc. <br><br>My thinking about Pools would be to change them to something like "Daring", "Intellect" and "Force", with the first modeling the action (blaster fights, swinging over chasms, etc.) and the second for using knowledge (chess matches, shutting down tractor beams, etc.).  The last could be used for any intuition or "taking a chance" actions, as well as powering force tricks.<br/><br/>As for Keys, you'd have all the usual type stuff- maybe Key of the Smuggler, Key of the Mission, etc.  I'm thinking everyone would start with "Key of the Dark Side" and "Key of the Light Side", giving folks points for any actions that reflect those moral positions.  Eventually someone will want to buy off one or the other, choosing their path for good.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It both guides someone who listens and follows their lead. It most certainly guides those who don't listen, though; you can call it luck if you want, or pluck, or whatever, but the point is that it's the fundamental life energy of the universe making things happen, and you can choose to participate in it or just be subject to its whims.</p>\n<p>So I wouldn't make The Force a score. I'd make it something you choose to interact with at any point. Sometimes the Force is what you use to deflect blaster bolts. Sometimes it decides it's time for you to die. Do you defy it?

Every time a Jedi did something (possibly other PCs too, I dunno) there would be a danger: "The Dark Side gains power over you."  On a good roll, you could stick a six over there and still succeed.  On a worse roll, you'd have a choice between success and keeping your heart pure.<br/><br/>That campaign never got off the ground, but I did use the same basic framework in a D&amp;D/Otherkind crossover game to good effect.<br/><br/>Of course, the moral struggle is just one of many Star Wars stories I'd want to tell (like I said above).

Like, for some things, you need a 13 on 2d6. It's not possible to get a proton torpedo down a ray shielded 2m port. Dude says so, even.</p>\n<p>Now, consider this: Luke's player is rolling, and rolling, and rolling, and all this shit keeps happening, cuz he doesn't want to spend that much, and each time it costs him Porkins, Gold One (who, at the moment of his death in the script, gets a little bio!), Biggs, Wedge, and R2. Finally, he's out of stuff to burn \u2014 he's down to Leia and Han/Chewy \u2014 and he decides he's going to do it. Maybe he rolled a 10, or even a 12, and only got 1-3 Darkness added to him. But the whole time that's what he was looking for, which is a 17% chance, rolled five times.</p>\n<p>So, the thing about Jedi are that they're patient. They wait until they have the roll to make something incredible happen. Sith or whatever just burn that shit right off.</p>\n<p>So, what are the consequences of darkness? Lessee...</p>\n<p>Han shoots Greedo, and gets a bounty on his head. Luke rushes off to face Vader, loses a friend and a hand. How do we codify that? I bet you can make a Star Wars-appropriate list. In both cases, they're deformed (encased in carbonite and disarmed ha ha). Han's also tortured and Luke gains a relationship. I hate to look to it as a source, but Palpatine deforms himself by continuing to attack Mace Windu when the cards are against him.</p>\n<p>So maybe you have a fallout list: you can gain deformation, gain relationships with other dark side characters, and maybe even gain more powers you can use to reach past that 12. Oh! Maybe they're bonuses! Only Dark Side stuff gives bonuses. It's all about power, right? (Edited after some thinking: this is a problem because you can only gain 1 or 2 of these before the Jedi become relatively impotent. Perhaps you get a +1 for every roll?

It literally converts the existing classes and powers over- so Fighters become Soldiers, Rogues become Scoundrels, Wizards become Engineers with mounted weapons, Rangers become Bounty Hunters, etc.  The force classes are Battlemind for Jedi Guardian, Psion for Jedi Consular, and Avenger for Jedi Sentinel.  The game plays great tactically and has a level of balance between the Jedi and non-Jedi you can't really find in any of the official Star Wars games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did this conversion, despite being more of a story guy than a combat guy because I love Saga Edition so much, but can't handle the fact that Jedi matter and everyone else are essentially supporting cast.  I also wanted to try my hand at writing 4th edition rules.  It was a lot of fun and easier than you'd think for a game that converts a mostly melee system into a mostly ranged system for combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the interesting developments that came about when running this has been that players often have to convert for themselves the flavor of their combat actions from a D&amp;D power to a StarWars power.  This adds a layer of creativity to the sometimes boring push-button feel of 4th edition powers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308758/#Comment_308758" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T10:47:23+00:00" title="January 19, 2011 10:47AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would look at the raw ingredients of Star Wars and build mechanics on them<br/>\n<br/>\n- Sci-Fi Illustrations from the 60's and 70's<br/>\n- Westerns (gun duels, tavern and lowlife scenes)<br/>\n- Samurai Movies (sword duels, training sequences, courtly and other formal scenes)<br/>\n- W.W.

It has never been "quicker and easier". Any system that doesn't actively reward you for turning to the Dark Side is not a good Dark Side system. You never should be penalized for turning to the Dark Side.

Jedi Propaganda! <br/><br/>(paraphrased from my contribution to the Awesome-o-fy Star Wars Thread)<br/><br/>There are no "Sides" of the force. Sure, the Jedi talk about a Light Side and a Dark Side, but in reality the Force is Life Energy and life is both beautiful and brutal and filled with passion and emotion.<br/><br/>The Jedi say they are all about becoming "One with the Force" but really they are afraid of it, so the repress their emotions, they control their feelings and they deny their humanity. It's all about control.<br/><br/>The Sith embrace the Force; they give in to emotion; love, rage, passion, you name it. Of course in the end they are consumed by their emotions, but hey, it's a hell of a ride.<br/><br/>There are good and bad eggs in both camps. <br/><br/>The Emperor represents the worst the Sith; he's consumed by hate and ambition, and the Force in him has become corrupt and foul. <br/><br/>Vader serves the Emperor but he's still Jedi through and through. He represses his grief and his despair and has not only lost his humanity, but his connection to the force as well. His once mighty Force powers have diminished to a feeble trickle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308860/#Comment_308860" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T13:20:33+00:00" title="January 20, 2011  1:20PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2011 1:23PM by Jacob.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Star Wars would be a total reboot of the Old Republic IP from the Sith persepective. <br/><br/>Several hundred years ago the Jedi and Sith worked together for forge a human Republic amid dozens of strange alien civilizations. The two philosophies eventually turned on each other and the Sith were forced into exile. Now, after several centuries the Sith have retuned to human controlled space and find the Republic corrupt and decadent, and teetering on collapse. <br/><br/>The Sith, once fierce individualists, have been forced to reinvent themselves into a social darwinistic military command structure in order to survive. The Jedi are much the same as they appear in the new trilogy; lots of good intent, but too busy navel gazing and postering for power in the political arena to be very effective.<br/><br/>The game would take place mostly on frontier worlds and would draw heavily from the Seven Samurai and Firefly. Lots of people living an 18th/19th century existance with the occasional pocket of super science.<br/><br/>Aliens would be rarely addressed, and they would be fricken' ALIEN. No wookie sidekick crap. I'm talking Lovecraft and HR Giger have a baby kind of stuff. Humanity needs Force Users of one kind or another so the crazy space monsters don't come down and lay eggs in people's heads. Even if the local humans see the Sith as Bad Guys, they'd still welcome them with open arms (the Jedi have pretty much withdrawn to the core worlds).<br/><br/>I'd keep the Hutts. Giant slug people?

(It could look like D6 Star Wars with house rules.) I'd steal a skill list from somewhere, for example D6 SW. For the Force I would use a combination of using Fate points, aspects and skills.<br/><br/>Using Fate points for Force is quite obvious, I think. Fate points work like the karma of the universe \u2013 just like the Force.<br/><br/>There would be different Force-skills for different Force powers. So using the ladder, it would make sense that if there is someone with huge Force strength (like Darth Vader), (s)he would most probably have more Force powers: if you can through lightnings, you most probably can use telekinesis or get strength surges.<br/><br/>Force aspects would work like that: by spending a Force aspect, you could invoke a Force power. But it wouldn't refresh normally, it would refresh when the character meets the criteria of the Force power. For example: there can be a Force aspect called telekinesis and there are Force skills, like "carrying" or "hurdling objects" under it. You can use your Force skills normally, but for a higher effect you have to spend the Telekinesis Force aspect. And as Yoda said, "Don't try. Do or do not." So if your character proves that (s)he doesn't tries, but does, than his/her telekinesis aspect gets refreshed.<br/><br/>It's possible that I will try that soon, but not 100%.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafe" title="Rafe"><img alt="Rafe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/580/nVD52VTM5722R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafe">Rafe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308998/#Comment_308998" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T17:26:03+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  5:26PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a 4-session Star Wars game with Burning Wheel, hacked with some Burning Sands mechanics and a boredom-infused, OCD-spurred PDF I wrote up to fill in some lifepaths and such. It was awesome and worked amazingly well. Players were really happy with it and, ironically, thought it was the most "Burning Wheel" of any of our BW games. Art Magic simply renamed as the Force was freakin' wicked. Had some great moments, especially in Fight! One of the players pulled his lightsaber to himself after being Disarm'd, for instance, and another used it to Throw an assassin droid into a girder, getting enough successes to effectively smash the droid... and Breach the girder. One of them even pulled a Jedi mind trick off on a Hutt's majordomo to gain access (though the Duel of Wits that ensued with the Hutt didn't go quite so well and resulted in an awesome chase through Nar Shaddaa).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I think about it, that's another damn hack I haven't finished yet. It was a helluva lot of fun, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309012/#Comment_309012" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T18:53:19+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  6:53PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's odd that I ran across this today, since I spent 4 or 5 hours thinking about this on the backburner while bored at the office. Here's what I came up with:<br/><br/>Each characters gets 4 stats:<br/><br/>Diplomat<br/>Scoundrel<br/>Jedi<br/>Pilot<br/>Soldier<br/><br/>You get, maybe 15d6 to divide between them, so you might have <br/><br/>Diplomat 7d6 Scoundrel 3d6 Jedi 1d6 Soldier 3d6 Pilot 1d6<br/><br/>It should be relatively clear when you roll each thing.<br/><br/>There's a pool of d4s on the table that are light side dice, and d8s that are dark side dice. You can draw on them whenever appropriate, and you really ought to be able to tell what's appropriately light or dark. Here's the catch: whenever a character uses dark side dice and they come up 1 or 8, the character keeps them and MUST roll them on any future roll, thus tainting all future rolls with the dark side, and if you have dark side dice, then you aren't allowed to take light side dice, unless your light side action is 'light side' enough to cancel out all your dark side dice.<br/><br/>Some kind of rudimentary chart showing acts of light and dark and how they scale would be needed.<br/><br/>Some rules for redemption (a la Vader sacrificing himself to save Luke).<br/><br/>In a game with no Jedi, you'd still want the Jedi trait, probably, but you might be able to do away with the entire force-dice mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KynnBartlett" title="KynnBartlett"><img alt="KynnBartlett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KynnBartlett">KynnBartlett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311034/#Comment_311034" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T02:03:44+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  2:03AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd do a game that used Star Wars action figures.<br/><br/>And play it with my nephews.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311078/#Comment_311078" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T08:28:01+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  8:28AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: KynnBartlett</cite>I'd do a game that used Star Wars action figures.</blockquote>Which is exactly what WotC did when they launched the d20 version at GenCon--I remember it well.
