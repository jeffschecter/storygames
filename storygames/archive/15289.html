Usually, each player takes care of one or more characters in the developing story. Some games in the tradition of role-playing games require one participant to take the roles of the various supporting characters, as well as introducing non-character forces (for example, a flood), but other systems dispense with this figure and distribute this function among all players.</blockquote>\nBut then it goes on:\n<blockquote>Non-role-playing games<br/><br/>An early design of a collaborative storytelling game not based in simulation was created by Chris Engle c. 1988[3][4] with his Matrix Game.[5] In this system, a referee decides the likeliness of the facts proposed by the players, and those facts happen or are rejected according with a dice roll. Players can propose counter-arguments that are resolved in a dice rolling contest. A conflict round can follow to resolve any inconsistencies or further detail new plot points. Matrix Games are now presented in a board game format.<br/><br/>In 1999, game designer Ian Millington [6] developed an early work called Ergo[7] which established the basis for collaborative role-playing. It was designed with the rules of the Fudge universal role-playing system in mind but added modifications necessary to get rid of the need for a gamemaster, distributing the responsibility for the game and story equally among all players and undoing the equivalence between player and character.<br/><br/>Modern rule systems (such as the coin system in Universalis[8]) rely less on randomness and more in collaboration between players. This includes rules based on economic systems that force players to negotiate the details of the story, and solve conflicts based on the importance that they give to a given plot element and the resources they're willing to spend to make it into the story.</blockquote>\nThe entry isn't wrong about the games. These are basically fairly accurate descriptions. It's that category: non-role playing game. There's nothing that explains why they would not be considered role playing games. They do not sound very different from the games described in the entry above (see the link). And they are role playing games, as far as I know. <br/><br/>This entry seems to make the claim that distributed games, and games that allow decision points based on non-simulation based stats are not rpgs. Very strong claim! And Wikipedia actually is the place where we decide the defintion of things, this is a formidable place to stake that claim. <br/><br/>I'd like to revise this, but am not involved in working on Wikipedia. If anyone is already in those circles and would like to work on it with me, let me know. Also, if Chris, Ian, Ralph and Mike consider their games to *not* be rpgs, then more power to the entry. But I still differ strongly with the definitions that seem implied.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347309/#Comment_347309" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-30T09:53:52+00:00" title="October 30, 2011  9:53AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone can just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Storytelling_game&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">edit the entry</a>.<br/><br/>If the issue is controversial, I suggest to point out the controversy, rather than giving only one version. <br/><br/>We should then monitor the page to see if the change gets rolled back..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347310/#Comment_347310" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-30T09:57:54+00:00" title="October 30, 2011  9:57AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't need to be already involved -- you can just register an account and edit the page.

The author says:\n<blockquote><br/>The central focus of the game is not to play a role, but instead to tell an interesting story. This is why Muse is best described as a Storytelling Game (STG).</blockquote>\nThat always seems like the right place to put the dividing line. Do you play a role? If not, it may be a storytelling game. <br/><br/>The other dividing lines would be is the dialogue andare the  actions taken in character improvised? If not, you may be acting.

Also for each definition there are partisan supporters who held it's the only "right" one, but thankfully we are entitled to ignore them with no afterthought when we're <i>doing science</i>.<br/>What I usually do when writing is: in cases when definition <i>matters</i>, I reference the one I'm using (be it "Stenros &amp; Hakkarainen, 2003" or "Luke's Incredibly Controversial Definition") and when it <i>really</i> matters I preferably use and reference <i>more</i> than one. That's certainly what I'd do on Wikipedia.<br/>All of the above doubly applies to "storytelling game" and variants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347566/#Comment_347566" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T15:41:19+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  3:41PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2011 3:42PM by MatrixGamer.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know this entry. I'm not personally bothered that Matrix Games are not seen as role play games but the categorization really isn't important to me. Over the years I've run MGs as miniatures games, role play games, card games and now board games. All that really speaks to is the props used to run the game rather than the game itself. Which means it's about marketing rather than substance.<br/><br/>Now Matrix Games did grow out of role play games. We were trying to come up with a way to role play entire countries. I favored the verbal route - using a dialog to resolve what happens next. I can't say I've ever done it is a really clean way though. I've used far too many dice rolls and stomped on people's creative energy far too much to really break through. <br/><br/>I'm going to do a play test this evening of a new rules set that stream lines play more. I hope it works better.<br/><br/>I use Wikipedia as a starting point - so inaccuracies are not a problem. I'll use it again for my next history lecture project for the Origins War College - a review of the Greek world 800 to 100 BCE. I want to explore colonization, democracy, imperialism, and culture along with economics and archeology. I want to lean heavily on ancient writers. Should be real cool - but definitely not a game. Wikipedia will probably not allow an article to stay posted on it. They tend to zap anything  I post there. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347595/#Comment_347595" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T01:41:42+00:00" title="November  2, 2011  1:41AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu: I guess in my head, partly based on watching discussions with self-professed story-gamers and partly just making it up, I concluded the two were different.
