                    Heya,<br/><br/>It's been a while since we've had a good awesome-o-fy old DnD setting.  I'm interested in doing one for the Raveloft.  Of all the cool bad-A setting back in the mid 90's I played in, this one was one of the scariest (as far as hoping against hope my character lived).  As I look back, it now just seems not as full and engrosing as it used to be.  So, let's make it awesome.  <br/><br/>If you were going to make the Raveloft the way you wanted it, what would it look like?  It can be any eddition, even the new Castle Ravenloft setting released by WotC last year.  What would an awesome Ravenloft look like?<br/><br/>I'll get things started with this.  Things that made Ravenloft Cool for me:<br/><br/>=Vampires<br/>=Lycanthropes<br/>=Paladins<br/>=Great Mansions<br/>=Fear<br/>=A candle of hope in an ocean of darkness<br/>=World-specific spells<br/>=The compelling struggle against overwhelming evil<br/>=Constant danger<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>

                            I've only played the first two Ravenloft modules. What I recall about them that sounded like it was going to be good in terms of creating mood and such, were the dream sequences. And they did do that to some extent.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was that the dreams were either one of two sorts:<br/>
<br/>
1. Color text where the DM was just supposed to read them. Or<br/>
2. A whole second life for the character that didn't seem to be all that different from their normal life i.e. not at all dreamlike.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it would be interesting to have some mechanic in the dreams where the player sometimes has control, but other times does not - and then has some control of the entire scene. Somewhat like in real dreams where the dreamer is out of control of even his own actions, but other times his will controls not only his own actions, but the events that occur as well.<br/>
<br/>
Make the dreams more dreamy, I guess, and give the players some interaction with them. Along with some rules on how the dream outcome impacts the waking world. When are they premonitions? What does that mean? Are they visions of a parallel spirit world? Etc.<br/>

                            Ravenloft was always so-so for me, so take my totally outsider views with a grain of salt (unlike Dark Sun or Planescape, or even Dragonlance, which I loved the hell outta).<br><br>For me, something that would be extremely interesting is if the world itself were 'evil', and didn't necisserily "do its Ravenloft thing" simply because the world was attracted to some particular badass or other. Because that could lead to...<br>...finding Strahd, and realizing that he's actually not a vampire. He's somehow made immortal against his wishes, he shies from people because they shun him, but he totally does not eat people or rule the realm with an iron fist. He's a tragic figure. Now what are the PCs going to do?<br>...THEN, after spreading peace and flowers to the townspeople of Ravenloft town, they realize that Strahd was actually fucking with you this whole time, he really is evil, and now he's gonna murder you in the face now that you've let your guard down.<br><br>Maybe have domains where some "darklords" really are innocent, others are guilty... damn, this is starting to sound like Dogs in the Mistyards or someshit, but that tension of not knowing who/where the source of evil is, that's cool IMO.<br><br>-----<br><br>Other than that, more candelabras, organ music, bodices (and ripping of them), old cathedrals, that sort of thing.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Another idea for flavor: Make Ravenloft OLD. Like, really really old.  Have it a place where one eastern-european style empire crumbled, replaced by another, taken over by another, and so on throughout history (thousands, if not tens of thousands, of years). The forgotten ruins of the abby might be from two generations ago, or from the Original Civilization ten thousand of years ago, and no way to be sure other than attempting to piece things together.  Evil immortal creatures (human and otherwise) might be a few decades, or several thousand years old.<br><br/>Maybe that hint of the ancient would cool-up some Ravenloft?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></div>

<p>Andy.  Dude.  I wanna play that, like... NOW.  I'm inclined to write up a TSOY hack for it.  But what I wonder is, what are the PCs up to there?  I've got one answer in mind, but I'd really like to hear your take on it.</p>
<p>Edited to add:  I've played all of one sessions in Ravenloft.  And that was just because we found this nifty-ass premade scenario that included a CD where you played certain tracks when you found certain clues.</p>

                            If I were to approach this, I'd be very tempted to do it like <i>Dictionary of Mu</i>. It feels very <i>Sorcerer</i> to me, with the lords being failed sorcerers who've lost their humanity and the PCs being potential lords themselves - can they fight the darkness without succumbing to it themselves?                        </div>

                            Ravenloft was my bread and butter when I was a teenager.  When we played AD&amp;D we mostly played Ravenloft.  I took those experiences, good and bad, and ran a game of Conspiracy of Shadows with it.  Here are the notes I put together for that game:<br/><br/><b>The Pitch</b><br/>There is something wrong in St. Archard but it is like a puzzle missing pieces. People have had accidents, but letters arrive in their names well after they have been buried. Soldiers are sent to eliminate rebels in the outlying villages, but only a few return and their memory is hazy. And the Marquis St. Archard has parties at his manor, inviting astrologers, macabre artists, alchemists, taxidermists, and others who's profession is a mystery.<br/><br/><b>The Kicker</b><br/>Late one night as you work to put these pieces together, a woman wrapped head to toe in swirling robes places an infant with mismatched eyes into your arms and a note pinned to the cloak it is wrapped in. A sudden gust of wind comes and when you look up she is gone. Only her shimmering cloak remains, twisting in the wind.<br/><br/><b>Mechanics Note:</b><br/>When you reach a Taint Rank of 6 you will have become a darklord and set up a domain of your own.<br/><br/><b>Figures of Note</b><br/>Henri St. Archard is the ruler of St. Archard and the surrounding region (seen in red on the map below). He is famous for holding parties with odd guest lists at his summer home in the countryside. The common people believe he has dark dealings with the Fey.<br/><br/>Adrien Beauvais is the cardinal of the Church of Ezra in Illes de Paynes. The common view that he is the most powerful man in the kingdom and rules through the weak king, Francois I.<br/><br/>Francois I is the king of the Illes de Paynes, the country in which St. Archard resides. The common view is that he is a puppet of Cardinal Beauvais.<br/><br/><b>Setting Material</b><br/>There are no demi-humans. Only humans. Also, the fantastical elements are not overt. No wizards in towers or clerics running around with healing spells. We stripped all that out.<br/><br/>We also leveled the technology playing field and set it at around the sixteen/seventeen hundreds. Cannons, muskets, pistols and rapiers.<br/><br/>Also, the horror is under the skin. More in the vein of Gothic novels and less like D&amp;D. As a group we felt that in order for the fantastic/horrific to have any effect it had to not be common place.<br/><br/>Empire of Darkon: is modeled on Czarist Russia. Azalin doesn't rule. Instead he is a sort of Rasputin character ruling through the wife of Czar Peter.<br/><br/>Kingdom of Falkonia: is pretty much the same as in the books. Vlad the Impaler if all the rumors are true and he is constantly duking it out with Darkon.<br/><br/>Iles de Paynes is like France. The country has two major conflict going on. Lamordia in the north, which it recently conquered (Germanic feel to it) and Invidia in the south, which just recently gained its independence.<br/><br/>Invidia is like the Kingdom of Navarre. Think of it as if the Basques had won their independence. However, it is a cultural mix of French and Slavic groups. It is ruled by the Dukar, who is the reason they won independence.<br/><br/>Barovia is like the former Yugoslavia. A bunch of Balkan like states held together by a dominant personality. It is ruled by the Devil Stahd through the proxie of his mortal decedents.<br/><br/>Badjoz aka Nova Vaasa, is like the Ottoman Empire. Across the Nocturnal Sea the majority of the empire sits. It is the great threat from the East.<br/><br/>The Shadow Rift is just a big canyon no one can explain, or really is willing to deal with. It is dark, creepy, filled with mists, and stange weather rolls out of it from time to time.<br/><br/>Church of Ezra: is the primary faith of Ravenloft. We are using the structure of the Albinican church from Conspiracy of Shadows for this game.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.bobgoat.com/images/goofing/core.jpg" rel="nofollow">The Modified Map of Ravenloft</a> </div>

Sounds like a set up for My Life with Master.<br/><br/>That was my Ravenloft awsomification idea from a few years back when I first read MLwM:  The Master is Stradd, and the players are his servants in the castle.   The party of adventurers that the players would normally be playing are, instead, the Outsiders that Stradd wants to impress for some reason. (I think because one of them looked exactly like his lost love or something like that.)  This was going to be a sort of MLwM intro, so I was going to grab my old copy of the original Ravenloft module (only Ravenloft product I've ever played) use the castle map as a common referance point and flesh out the NPCs in the village and Gypsy camp as a relationship map.<br/><br/>Side note: I need to get Conspiracy of Shadows. :P                        </div>

                            Troy,<br/><br/>A combination of both mystery unveiled over time with some player created input.  See in Conspiracy of Shadows, players get to use what is called Destiny Points to add shit to the game.  But it is a resource so it ain't like they are making up the whole thing... Just parts of it.  It is basically a tool for the GM to be able to tailor the mystery to the players interests at the table, while still having the leeway to throw in what interests him.<br/><br/>See back in the day, I was the only one with all the Ravenloft crap, so shit came to light over time and it worked out great.  Part of the fun for everyone was seeing what was going to surprise them next.  Fear of the unknown is a big part of that, and you can't get that without some level of mystery.                        </div>

                            Ravenloft was my big 2nd Ed. setting love.<br/><br/>I love the mists. Oh, the mists - they just come up and whisk you away to more and more horror. I think it would be boss if there was total player control over when the mists come up, but the GM still gets to decide where you land.<br/><br/>I really liked all the weird spooky monsters (I still have all my old Ravenloft Monstrous Compendium supplements). <br/><br/>What about turning the setting on its head   (and kind of combining it with Birthright) - you play Dreadlords, maybe starting with the event that earns them their Domain, and then you play out their battles against each other.                        </div>

                            Nathan,<br/><br/>We fucking did that!  We did two sessions of it.  Everyone created some sort of dark lords (I think we had a death knight, a vampire, a necromancer, and a werewolf who was his own walking micro-domain) and went to town with the Birthright rules.  The problem was the Birthright rules kinda suck, and so we drifted into a sort of free-form/DM handwaiving shit sort of game (which we did every time we tried to play Birthright).  It was lots of fun...<br/><br/>And Judd knows not what he speaks of.  CoS Fables would rawk on toast probably as much as a BW all wolf game...                        </div>

                            Heya,
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Senkowski</cite><br/><br/>A combination of both mystery unveiled over time with some player created input. See in Conspiracy of Shadows, players get to use what is called Destiny Points to add shit to the game. But it is a resource so it ain't like they are making up the whole thing... Just parts of it. It is basically a tool for the GM to be able to tailor the mystery to the players interests at the table, while still having the leeway to throw in what interests him.<br/></blockquote>
That's what I thought you meant, Keith.  And that's awesome stuff!  Although, it would make the game more like a one-shot campaign module rather than a Setting, don't you think? (not that that's a bad thing)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            I don't think the mists coming to take you away should be under total player control.  I think the following would be cool.<br/><br/>A stat called "Doom" or some such.  It starts out high.  With high Doom, the Dark Lord (Strahd, Lord Soth, whoever) has mega-bonuses to everything and is totally in control.  As the players uncover more and more of the mystery the Doom score goes down.  The Dark Lord has less and less advantage.  However, at specific points along the way (perhaps when players take certain actions) you roll to see if the mists come and whisk you away.  The roll is based on the party's Doom score.  High Doom has almost no risk of being whisked away.  Low Doom gets whisked away frequently.<br/><br/>Anyway... that's my little idea.<br/><br/>Ravenloft rocks, btw.   At least I thought the original module did.  I wasn't as impressed with the whole campaign setting.                        </div>

                            Gaerik,<br/><br/>Clint Krause did something pretty similar to what you are describing.  He took the Doom mechanic in Conspiracy of Shadows and turned it into a really awesome community mechanic for his game <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=7691" rel="nofollow">Roanoke</a>.<br/><br/>However, I think you are going in the wrong direction.  Ravenloft for me has always been about the tragic struggle that you can't win.  It is the realm of evil, not good claimed by evil, just straight up evil.  If anything I would start with the Doom being managable in the beginning and getting worse as time goes on.  The Dark Lord doesn't have less of an advantage but more of an advantage over time.  The oppressiveness of the place slowly eats at you over time.  Strahd or Soth or whoever the fuck has had more time to study you.  They are ancient evils who have been gutting better men than the characters for centuries.  Time and planning and the very land is all on their side.  It is when you realize this at the end that they get their final victory, shattering any hope you might have just before they rip out your throat...                        </div>

Alright, Nathan.  Why don't you tell us which monsters you liked the best and why?  How would you awesome-o-fy them now?

                            Monsters...<br/>
<br/>
I suppose if we remove all of the other monsters, except for the vampire, that we'll have created the Dracula RPG?<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that part and parcel of Ravenloft is encountering monsters that, to real folks would be terrifying, but who, to D&amp;D adventurers cannot be a thread. I mean Owlbears aside with their five hit dice, what about bugbears? Defined as seven foot tall goblins? That should be some scary shit. In D&amp;D it's just not.<br/>
<br/>
How's some vampire going to be scary? Oh, I see. By giving him metagame powers so that he has plot immunity.<br/>
<br/>
I mean it sorta works. Other than that it leads to railroading. But is the monster slaying really all that key? Do we have to have it? I guess so.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a case where you have a setting that comes about because of the game system. My usual suggestion is that there's a core of these settings that can come out with another game system. But I'm trying to see this one working with Hero Quest for example (the one I usually apply). And I'm imaginging the PCs having to fight all those monsters... And it's just silly. The best I can get is some Buffy the Vampire slayer vibe. With Strahd having the sort of plot immunity that Spike has.<br/>
<br/>
To the extent that Ravenloft is "D&amp;D-ified Dracula" it's going to be hard to improve without just putting it back to being Dracula. And not because it's good.<br/>
