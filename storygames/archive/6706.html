Let me throw some things at you.<br/><br/>Dogs tends to use a lot of dice, so it would be tough probability-wise for the smaller dice.<br/><br/>For example, if there are already an A and 2 out from the d4 deck, I'm going to be a lot more likely to want to bring in a troublesome trait since it will be a 3 or a 4.<br/><br/>Plus, if I remember correctly, there's a rule about fallout relating to which dice you actually use in a conflict.  And it wouldn't be as easy to see which dice type was used at a glance as when the dice are actually sitting in front of you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148704/#Comment_148704" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T02:26:27+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  2:26AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talking fallout just went from almost guaranteed experience to absolutely guaranteed experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148726/#Comment_148726" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T07:48:27+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  7:48AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Chris says, a new dynamic of player control over choices by seeing the changing odds comes to mind. This would push many players into some kind of new play strategy I'd imagine, since every result is guaranteed now. I actually played with designing a Settlers of Catan variant that used a deck of results instead of 2d6, asserting that all the areas would actually hit in their proper proportions.

So with a 2d8+1d4 stat, you'd draw 7 cards.<br/><br/>It means that 4d4 is as good as 2d6 (or 1d10). You can do well with small dice, but you'll have a smaller hand. If you were using four different decks, then if the high cards are gone early on from say the d8 deck, then d4s and d6s start looking like better deals.  You could also have the decks be combined depending on how many are drawn (so the d10 deck is four decks combined) or do something like d8 means you draw one card from d4, one from d6, and one from d8.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
