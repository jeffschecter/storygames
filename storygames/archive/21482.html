HoS is a collaborative storytelling game inspired by Game of Thrones. <br/><br/>I\u2019m open to doing this in public if people are interested in either checking out the design process or participating in giving feedback, perspectives, etc. <br/><br/>Anyway, let me know if you are either interested in seeing the design process or participating by giving your feedback, your perspectives, etc. If folks are interested I will start posting HoS stuff and going through at least some of the process publicly.</del><br/><br/>Thanks all <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470024/#Comment_470024" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-15T20:45:56+00:00" title="February 15, 2018  8:45PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2018 8:48PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am, of course (stating the obvious here).<br/><br/>I think a GMless version of a <i>Game of Thrones</i>-style fictional scenario would be appealing to a huge cross-section of gamers (at least in the story game scene).

I personally think that time has proven it as the best approach for a small press game: you gain friends and attention for your project long before the game is finished. You're essentially marketing simultaneously with designing. The only real reason not to do it is if your process doesn't bend naturally to the needs to public work - having to fend comments from others, having to maintain a regular update schedule, etc.<br/><br/>The one thing I'd particularly like to highlight as an advantage of the public process is the possibility of attracting like-minded "advocates" for your project: people who hear about it early on, like what they hear, check out the design, appreciate it, and then go on to not only help you finish the game, but also to help in marketing it.<br/><br/>New designers particularly need all the advantages they can get, plus the nature of the advantages you get from a public process (a wide variety of double-checking of your work, potential to attract advocates) is particularly useful for new designers.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I\u2019m open to doing this in public if people are interested in either checking out the design process or participating in giving feedback, perspectives, etc. </p></div></blockquote>\nI feel like this observation should be sort of obvious: you're much more likely to get somebody interested in doing any of those things if you <i>first</i> post your draft and <i>then</i> see if anybody cares. I mean, that's how we decide what we care about: you post your draft, we fall in love with your ideas. It's a sure sign of an insane commitment to game development for somebody to say that they want to do critique on a game <i>before</i> they see what sort of project it is [grin].

I will start showing my design process and posting the design stages the game goes through; I\u2019ll ask for feedback (here and elsewhere) and show adjustments I\u2019m making in the development process. I\u2019ll talk about anything that might pertain to the the design/ publishing/marketing/etc process that might be helpful or of interest.<br/>2. Ron Edwards will be consulting on the game and he\u2019s doing some of his consulting work in the open...there are some great videos on his <a href="http://adeptplay.com/consulting" rel="nofollow">site</a> that show his work and you should definitely check them out; they\u2019re very insightful. I really found both the <b>Tales of Entropy</b> and <b>Directions Storyplaying System</b> consultanting videos very interesting; BTW, both of these games where/are being designed by members of this site, <a href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila">@PetteriHannila</a>  and <a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">@BeePeeGee</a> respectively; also <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> was also  quite involved in the design process of <b>Tales of Entropy</b>, and if Eero\u2019s into it, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m excited about both of these games. I\u2019m preparing some game info for Ron and we should be doing our first consultantion in a couple of weeks. Ron may decide to post that consulting video on his <a href="http://adeptplay.com/" rel="nofollow">site</a>, and if so, I will link to it. I also have some other highly respected designers, whose ideas people would be interested in hearing, consulting on the game, but I\u2019m only going to mention their names, and include any of their process with me, if (and to the degree) they are okay with it. Maybe they will be open to it?<br/>3. Eventually, I can go over some stuff like  crowdfunding, publishing, marketing, etc., so people can learn from my process/experience/mistakes, but it will be a long time until that stage; I\u2019m going to be designing and redesigning and playtesting and re-playtesting my game like crazy for a long time. I really want it to be good and so I\u2019m going to work very hard on it for a very long time and consult the absolute best minds in the indie rpg design world to get all of the help I can.<br/><br/>I can\u2019t promise that this post will be completely comprehensive because I have to put the game first. But as I put documents together for consultants, and playtest, I will post about my design process and give context and anything else I can that I think will be interesting or helpful to other designers and players.<br/><br/>Please let me know what other things you would like to see posted in this thread, and any things you don\u2019t want to see. <br/><br/>In a week or two I will post a very basic outline of the game. I will also try to have some artwork for folks to look at and maybe you can help me decide what would work best for a cover for the book or at least choose a piece of art to represent the game in the meanwhile.  My wife is doing the art for the game so we\u2019ll see how things go.<br/><br/>Thank you all for your interest and your willingness to engage with the project. It\u2019s very much appreciated!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470068/#Comment_470068" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-18T17:38:45+00:00" title="February 18, 2018  5:38PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exciting, Jeff!

The space we are working in has a lot of potential and I think that\u2019s the reason we are all drawn to it; it\u2019s space ripe for innovation, and exploring new territory in it will be a challenge, but it will also offer a big opportunity at the same time. <br/><br/>I know this all sounds crazy, overly optimistic, and even na\xefve and grandiose, but I think a little bit of this type of thinking will actually be a good thing and help to avoid the cynicism that can creep into some designers that of been after it for a while. Passion is a good thing, maybe even obsession.<br/><br/>If you have some time to respond with the names of your games, and link to the threads, I\u2019d appreciate it.<br/><br/>Thank you for your interest in my game and thanks for being passionate about games <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470086/#Comment_470086" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-19T16:27:50+00:00" title="February 19, 2018  4:27PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Jeff. Note that there is something that every new designer needs to do, I think, to find this hobby rewarding artistically and socially: you need to network with your peers, and that's something that others writing about their own experiences cannot do for you. You need to find other people who are passionate about the same things you are, and although we try to "keep the doors open", it's entirely a two-way street when people try to build connections - you have to do your own legwork to discover who your peers are.<br/><br/>So yeah, read up on each other's games and say it when you find something enticing and significant. That's how you build new bridges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470089/#Comment_470089" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-19T17:57:59+00:00" title="February 19, 2018  5:57PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2018 6:02PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading this thread makes me happy.\n<blockquote><br/>To<br/>The Inhabitants of SPACE IN GENERAL<br/>And H.

They are both \u201cdifferent\u201d, more gimmicky or quirky than truly innovative I\u2019d say, but my other ideas are not finished enough yet, so I\u2019ve just released these two small games  into the wilds so far.

For those of you who don\u2019t know who Ron is, he is the author of Sorcerer, the founder of the Forge, and the main reason we have such a thriving \u201cindie\u201d RPGs scene. I highly, highly recommend that you hire Ron to consult on your game. I\u2019ll give more details of what he offers and pricing below. <br/><br/>I suggest that you skip to 19:00, when viewing the video, because until then, Ron and I, are largely talking past each other or about stuff other than my game. He is basically asking me what the setting of House of Spiders is like, and I\u2019m misunderstanding the question. <br/><br/>House of Spiders is less about the setting and more about tones, themes, and certain types of characters. It is kind of like Fiasco in that it doesn\u2019t really have a specific setting, rather it is trying to tell a certain type of story. In the same way that Fiasco is trying to tell a Coen brothers like story, House of Spiders is trying to tell A Game of Thrones-ish type of story (in the best possible sense)...it\u2019s more about setting up a story with those types of tones, themes, characters, conflicts, etc., and it mostly lets you fill in and establish the facts and color of the setting during setup and to flush it out as you play. I very much hesitate to use Game of Thrones as a comparison because it\u2019s not exactly accurate, it\u2019s just an easy way to invoke the idea that courtly intrigue, Machiavellianism, power, ect is a central part of the game, by referencing something people are familiar with. But it may also sell the game short, and give people the wrong idea about it. Here\u2019s how Ron describes the essence of House of Spiders; I think it gives a better picture of what the game is actually like, and its driving aesthetic:<br/><br/>-Influence: trust and distrust, loyalty and conscience, promises and payments<br/>-Privilege: perceived virtue, authority through violence, social stability and instability, status vs. wealth<br/>-Control of information: unwelcome truths, withheld truths, lies, compartmentalization<br/>-Patience: the tension of the right time vs. too late, the contradiction of preserving a passionate impulse for future ends<br/><br/>So Ron was asking me a simple question: What\u2019s the setting like? And I was giving him complicated answers that weren\u2019t directly answering his question. Long story short, save yourself some time and frustration and start at 19:00.<br/><br/>The consultation gets especially good towards the end, as I explain my game in more detail and Ron gets a fuller understanding of it. Ron, provides some excellent insights that are very valuable and are without a doubt going to change my game for the better. I wouldn\u2019t have come up with a few of these paradigm shifting insights by myself, and my game wouldn\u2019t have been as good as a result. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the video. <br/><br/>Here is what Ron offers for $100 for indie designers:<br/><br/>-Reading<br/>-Playtest: external or with you<br/>-One solid consult session, by phone or email or hangout as you prefer<br/>-One strategic publishing discussion, recommendations, and networking<br/>-Promotion and public discussion on social media at a designated time<br/><br/>This is an insanely generous deal by one of the top designers in the profession. If you don\u2019t take advantage of it there\u2019s something wrong with you!

Intrigue upon intrigue upon intrigue. The group in large part enjoyed the experience and felt more positive about the way the game played than I did (yet at the same time they were very perceptive about the areas that could use improvement. I want my game to be extremely solid and to precisely and thoroughly meet the goals of my design, and it still needs a lot of work to do so. The game may be fun but it is very slippery and needs mor structure. The group\u2019s feedback and constructive criticisms where extremely productive and insightful; I\u2019m very greatful to them and indebted to them. I appreciate their time and willingness to help immensely. <br/><br/>I want the game to solve the problems in the GMless Collaborative Storytelling Game design space, <i>as I see them</i>. This playtest session gave me more information than I\u2019ve ever received from a playtest. I can see clearly where the opportunities lie in order for me to achieve the aims of the design <br/><br/>I\u2019m excited and reinvigorated to improve the game and I have come up with some great ideas about how to do it; it\u2019s going to involve a sea-change and radical restructuring the game (which it should, this is a sign of real progress). Burn the dead wood off, and then burn it off again; if you want to create a great game you must kill your darlings, and you must do so gladly. <br/><br/>The changes will differentiate the game, and likely solve a lot of problems, at least <i>from my perspective</i>, that have yet to be solved in this design space. I\u2019m extremely happy with all that I\u2019ve learned from the playtest and the solutions that have presented themselves. Just because a game is fun doesn\u2019t mean that it is achieving its goals or is even solid. I want <b>House of Spiders</b> to be built upon a rock.<br/><br/>When I rewrite the game I will share it; I apologize for how much time it is taking to give you folks something more solid than a discussion or video of consultants and I discussing a game in abstract that you\u2019ve yet to read or play yourselves. I\u2019m very greatful for your interest and don\u2019t take it as for granted and as a give. Thank you for being patient with me.<br/><br/>P.S. Zack, Mahony, Carrie, Roy, and Scott (who is a new member of Story Games SLC\u2014this was his first session)\u2014thank you all for your generosity and for you wonderful and insightful feedback!  Please let me know the next time you playtest, or would like a studio critique of  your games, I\u2019m there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470505/#Comment_470505" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-09T20:49:17+00:00" title="March  9, 2018  8:49PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for all the info, this is very valuable for my own progression.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470540/#Comment_470540" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-11T13:59:15+00:00" title="March 11, 2018  1:59PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2018 9:49PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have an exciting and unexpected announcement: I\u2019ve offered our own <a href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">@Zachary_Wolf</a> (Zach wolf) to come on as co-creator of <b>House of Spider</b> and he has excepted. Zach is also a member of Story Games Salt Lake City. <br/><br/>To many of you who know me personality, and know that HoS is my baby and of great importance  to me, so this may come as a surprise. I didn\u2019t make the decision lightly. I had not envisioned a co-author; however, as Zach presented his design ideas for the game it quickly became apparent that he understood what I was trying to achieve with HoS and it\u2019s aims, and he had understood this extremely quickly; It was obvious that he could help in implementing them, and that he was able to offer a different perspective. His ideas will make the game better, and that is the most essential an important thing to me. He\u2019s has some ideas that while elegant may turn out to be powerful. <br/><br/>I\u2019m very excited about where things are going with the design. I\u2019m excited and nervous at the same time, but I\u2019m confident we will be able to solve the problems, as I see them, within this design space. Which from my perspective would be a great triumph. Two good minds are better than one, and Zack has a good mind for design. <br/><br/>We\u2019re also working on a websiteI am\u2014well as a number of other projects \u2013 where we will<br/>host playtest docs, eventually build up a database of player generated quick-play scenarios, showcase the game, etc, etc.  I have a number of things at work and we will share them as we can. <br/><br/>As we get cool stuff done, we\u2019ll post it. I will start posting more concrete parts of the game, promotion advice, website design, more consulting info, live plays, etc, etc soon.
