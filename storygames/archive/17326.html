I've been working on a project that I think you all might find interesting, and I'd love to get your feedback.  Hope I've chosen the right category here.  (I was going to post to Praxis but it looks largely inactive...?)<br/><br/>My project is a <b>web-based system for writing and playing story-driven games</b>.  It's light on rules and it's time-shifted, so that everyone can play at their own pace.  I call it <b>VORPS</b> (lulz?), which maybe stands for Virtual Online Roleplaying System.<br/><br/>I set out to create VORPS because I missed the RPGs I used to play with friends many years ago (AD&amp;D and Champions, and a little GURPS).  But in the process of creating VORPS I think I ended up with something different.  I'm not even sure it's an RPG.  I think it is much closer to a "story game", as the term is used on these forums.  It does have some elements of classic RPGs (health points, levels, and classes) but they're mostly there to provide just enough structure to drive player behavior.<br/><br/>VORPS is almost like a blog with simple game mechanics.  It also has the concept of "sourcebooks", which are reusable, structured documents that define a setting and all of its components (character classes, items, history, GM guidelines, etc).  Sourcebooks can be shared with other people, who can use them to run their own games and tell their own stories.<br/><br/>Here's an example game in progress -- one of the alpha test campaigns I'm running with some friends.  (It's been going on for a few months so it might be easier to follow the story if you hit the "switch to book view" link to switch the game to chronological order.)<br/><br/><a href="http://myvoiceismypassport.vorps.com/game/2" rel="nofollow">http://myvoiceismypassport.vorps.com/game/2</a><br/><br/>And here is the "sourcebook" that the campaign is based on:<br/><br/><a href="http://myvoiceismypassport.vorps.com/sourcebook/1" rel="nofollow">http://myvoiceismypassport.vorps.com/sourcebook/1</a><br/><br/>(Those are special links that will let you poke around without a login and pretend that you're the GM.)<br/><br/>VORPS is still in an alpha state, but everything works.  I would hugely appreciate any feedback on the idea or its execution!<br/><br/>I'm also <b>looking for GMs to run campaigns</b>, as well as for <b>people who want to try writing a sourcebook</b>.  Maybe you've had an idea for a campaign setting or a game design rattling around in your head but haven't had the time to write it up or the means to publish it for others to use.  I *think* VORPS could be for you.  If any of the above sounds interesting, <b>whisper me your name and email address and I'll create you an account</b>!<br/><br/>Thanks for listening, everybody.  I'm looking forward to being a part of this community.<br/><br/>Stephen Hood<br/><a href="/forums/profile/stlhood">@stlhood</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392636/#Comment_392636" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T14:34:46+00:00" title="October  7, 2012  2:34PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh my.

I think the main difference from my vision is that I wanted a GM-less system (mostly inspired by Universalis).</blockquote>\nThanks!  I've tinkered with the idea of making it GM-less, but so far I've had the most success by having one "player" be responsible for the story's integrity, and the other "players" being responsible for its characters.\n<blockquote>Things I'd like to see: A way to track NPCs (extending the cast of characters beyond the "Players" list.) Explicit demarcation of scenes.</blockquote>\nCool, NPCs are on my to-do list!  I'll move it up in priority.  Demarcation of scenes is very interesting.  I am experimenting with the concept of "chapters" and "acts", which might also be a good way to divide up a campaign into multiple adventures or sessions (to use the metaphor of in-person RPG play).\n<blockquote>What happens if a player makes a move that the GM decides couldn't happen as written? Can the GM undo the move or does s/he just add a note stating "Well, it didn't happen quite like that\u2026" and describing what did happen?</blockquote>\nThere is a comment system that everyone can use at all times.  If the GM does not accept the player's move, they can tell them so, and the player can edit it -- the old move remains but is "struck-out" so you can follow the conversation historically.  You'll see some examples of that in the example game that I gave the link for.  The game doesn't advance until the GM starts the next turn, so they ultimately can control what is and is not allowed.\n<blockquote>How does one get invited to the private testing? ;-) I think I could dig up a few friends to play with me.</blockquote>\nThat would be awesome, thank you.  Just whisper me your name and your email address and I'll create you an account with GM privileges.  When you create a game, VORPS takes care of the whole process inviting your players, getting them signed-up, and creating their characters!<br/><br/>Thanks again for the feedback!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392656/#Comment_392656" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T20:15:58+00:00" title="October  7, 2012  8:15PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey!

I am actually trying to make VORPS as genre- and style-neutral as possible, so I welcome your experiment.  Subvert away!\n<blockquote>First up, since physical health doesn't matter all that much, I'm going to reinterpret it as Luck - how much the universe favors you as of the moment.

Although HP and PP do tie into the game mechanics in specific ways (when you hit 0 HP you become unconscious, and you can't use your class' Talent if you don't have enough PP) it doesn't necessarily have to be that way.  Perhaps you (the sourcebook author) should be able to name these HP points whatever you want them to be called.\n<blockquote>Now, characters.

Rails has its pros and cons but it's the framework I know the best, and I wanted to make quick progress on the idea, so there you have it.  Heroku is great for offloading sysadmin/config/maintenance overhead, at least for early-stage projects.  I may migrate to EC2 as VORPS grows, we'll see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stlhood" title="stlhood"><img alt="stlhood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/288/nVP24WH8OIYEI.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stlhood">stlhood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392786/#Comment_392786" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T20:27:37+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  8:27PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops, VORPS was down for a little bit due to some derp-ness on my part.
