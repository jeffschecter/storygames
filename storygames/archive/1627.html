                    Every once in a while, I try to get friends interested in RPG's if it seems to be the kind of thing they'd dig but just don't know about.  Once in a while, I try to write something down, explaining who does what, and why.<br/>
<br/>
Most Forge-y games involve a "conflict resolution mechanic" of some kind.  What's the point of having such a thing?  When, in general, should it be used?<br/>
<br/>
Like: for me, all this RPG stuff is about collaborating to tell a story.  There will be moments, though, when the actual-people-around-the-actual-table can't agree on something--or, we know something should happen but we're not sure how it would shake down in the imaginary world of the story.  So, we reach for the dice/cards/coins to settle the issue.  In other words, it's really solving a Conflict at the table: either between players who disagree, or an 'internal conflict' caused by uncertainty.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this seems intuitive to me, but I'm not a game designer or theorist.  I'm also aware that this can't QUITE be right, because the implication is that if the players are totally grooving on each other's ideas there's no conflict and hence no need for resolution--whatever's suggested happens.  And while this may be a valid way to play for some games, I get the impression that few Forge-y games are not meant to be played in this "kumbayah" sort of way.<br/>
<br/>
Pretend you're explaining to someone who's never played an RPG before.  What requires rolling dice, what doesn't require rolling dice, and what's a judgment call?  And why?                </div>

                            Hmm, Vincent describes it pretty well in Dogs in the Vinyard. "Say yes or roll the dice."  (actually, the quote is "Roll dice or say yes.") Read the section on p.138 "Drive Play Toward Conflict".<br><br>The key to your "not quite right" moment is that the GM must drive the game towards conflict. In DitV, you can use the town construction guidelines to create a sufficiently pregnant situation to drive towards conflict, and if the players don't bite, push harder and harder. In (traditional "kill things and take their treasure") D&amp;D, you explain the purpose of the game, then provide rooms full of monsters and treasure, and if the players don't bite, have the monsters start attacking the PCs.<br><br>Frank                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi, James. If I qualify as a guy who writes "Forgey" games, then you're making much ado over nothing. That's EXACTLY how I explain it in my published games texts, kumbayah be damned. My impression is that of your impression is off!<br><br>In my published games, I use language that goes something like this from-the-hip example: <br><br>"You are all working together to create a story together. Inevitably, though, you're bound to have different ideas about 'what happens next' in the story. This is conflict, and this game explains rules you can use to resolve 'what happens next' in your games."<br/><br/>Obviously, there's a bit more to the details. And, also obviously, it pretty much matches what you already said. So, as far as I can tell, you're not giving yourself enough credit!                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>James...every game describes when the resolution mechanics engage. I don't think it's especially useful to try to talk about them in the general case; they are too varied.</p>

                            Well, a game has identity.  That's why we can ever be said to be playing (say) D&amp;D rather than Vampire.  A major part of the identity of a game in play is what it's system has authority over.  Rolling dice is a subset of situations when the game tells you "come consult me to find out what happens next".  Specifically, it's a situation where the game designer has decided that the game's purposes are best served by some degree of uncertainty.<br/><br/>But I've a sneaking suspicion that's me overthinking it.  If I was explaining why we roll dice to someone who was new to RPGs, I'd probably do it in reference to a specific game.  And the chances are (for something like world of darkness) I'd say something like:<br/><br/>"We roll dice to provide a certain amount of uncertainty, which often results in drama and can spur creativity.  Also, this game tries to create the impression of a "virtual world", which means things should work roughly how you'd expect them to.  Bit there's always going to be more variables than can be accounted for, or even <i>known</i>.  And so we assume that the effect of "all other things considered" could be anywhere from <i>this much</i> to <i>this much</i> and ask the dice exactly how much it is this time."                        </div>

                            Well... it depends somewhat on the game, but here's what I say in The Mountain Witch:
<blockquote>A conflict represents those situations where the characters must overcome opposition or resistance to acheive what they hope to accomplish. This can take a number of forms:<br/><br/>--Active opposition from a living creature, regardless of whether the creature is directly or indirectly opposing you;<br/>--Some sort of active resistance from a non-living or static obstacle;<br/>--Any situation that carries with it an associated cost for failing.<br/><br/>More subtly, conflicts represent <b>conflicts of interests</b> between characters. One character wants to see one thing happen, and another something else. A Conflict roll determines whose interest is realized...<br/><br/>In this sense, a Conflict is not about a character's skill. TMW assumes competent characters, and under "normal" circumstances the character should automatically accomplish any reasonable action within their ability. A Conflict roll is only required when the character is confronted with active opposition or something likewise out of the ordinary. The question is not if a character can physically accomplish the task at hand, but rather can they overcome the forces that are working against them.<br/><br/>... [I]t is still a good idea for you to roll the dice whenever a player suggests a course of action that has a reasonable chance of failure. Even when everyone everyone at the table wants to see a character succeed (or fail), adding that random element of the die roll will often push the story in unexpected---and intersting---directions.</blockquote>
The reason you roll dice in story games isn't to solve disagreement---it's to push the story in interesting and unpredictable directions. That's what story games are about, improvising fiction. It's not <i>just</i> about collaborative story creation.<br/><br/>[edit] <i>That's kinda what Thomas said.</i> [/edit]                        </div>

                            I'm aware that no two games are alike.  Yet every RPG that I'm aware of has some sort of system for resolving tasks/conflicts/hullaballoo's.  ("Hullaballoo Resolution System" tm &amp; c)  Granted that the specific function of the system and the exact procedures about how it's invoked will vary, but why does it exist across (nearly) the whole hobby?<br/>
<br/>
But it sounds like my initial impression--to settle arguments, or give advice in uncertainty--is more or less what people are sayin'.  So that's cool, then.                        </div>

                            I'm not fond of the "rolling dice because the players disagree" formulation. In fact, I think dice rolling is best when the players absolutely agree on the fiction and they buy into the idea that the dice make the game exciting.                        </div>

                            Hey James, I wrote a bunch of blog threads a while ago, aimed at people outside the subculture, when I was just getting back into this whole gaming thing. This post -  <a href="http://farmerversusfox.blogspot.com/2006/03/making-case-for-story-games-iii-why.html" rel="nofollow">"Why would you need a rules to make a story together? Why not just talk it through?"</a> - is pretty much my take on what you're asking. My feelings are:<br/><br/>1 negotiation between disagreements, sure,<br/>2 a guidance system to help avoid disagreement arising in the first place, both by demarcating the kind of story you want to play (eg, one with lots of combat) and delineating roles and responsibilities to take the pressure off the social level<br/>3 guiding and delivering story, as per <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=291685" rel="nofollow">Tony's current RPGnet thread</a><br/><br/>The post goes into more detail but I won't reproduce it here; it's worth noting that it follows on from <a href="http://farmerversusfox.blogspot.com/2006/03/making-case-for-story-games-i-why-make.html" rel="nofollow">this post</a> and <a href="http://farmerversusfox.blogspot.com/2006/03/making-case-for-story-games-ii-why.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.                        </div>

                            In Monopoly, you roll dice to go around the track, and the game proceeds. The rules don't say why you do so.<br/>
<br/>
In Universalis, the text says that in order to get more coins in a scene, that you have complications. The rules don't say why you do so.<br/>
<br/>
Some theorists have pointed out after the fact that this mechanic works to produce conflict in the story product. But that's not something players need to know to have fun.<br/>

                            Oh yeah - one reason to use dice that <i>isn't</i> about creating uncertainty, is to work in degrees smaller than the scale of the game.  That's a really awkward sentence.  I will explain with an example:<br><br>Everyone in game X has five hit points.  You might want a weapon to do less than one but more than zero damage.  Half a point of damage would be ideal.  But working with halves is inelegant, and you don't want to double all the hit point/damage values.  So instead you interpret the fraction as a probability and say that you flip a coin - the attack does 0 damage on a tails and 1 damage on a head.<br><br>You can do the same thing with resource expenditure systems.  You don't want to be dealing with pools of more than (say) ten points, but you want people to be spending those points <i>all the time</i> and you also want a fairly wide range of possible costs for things.  So you change "number of points you need to spend to do X" to "probability of losing a point when you do X" with the rider that you must have at least one point in order to do X in the first place. Which effectively multiplies the size of the resource pool (when looked at over time) without increasing the fiddliness of record-keeping.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I keep seeing this argument <i>against</i> the words "player disagreement." I am unconvinced. At the very least, within the scope of games I'm interested in, I don't recognize where player disagreement is <i>not</i> happening. <br><br>Along those lines, I consider the following nonsense, despite Vincent and Ron trying to convince me otherwise: <br><br>Conflict is all about when characters want different things in the fiction. <br/><br/>It's nonsense to me because the Characters Don't Exist. Characters -- even "fit" ones -- want nothing more than what we put into them. They are, however mutely or indirectly, our real-world-people's desires. Thus, characters desire only that which players desire. <br/><br/>Therefore, when two (or more) players want different things to happen, we have conflict.<br/><br/>So, it brings my head back around to my definition: "Conflict is when players have different ideas about 'what happens next' in the story."<br/><br/>I used to use the word "disagree" instead of "have different ideas." I don't anymore. I think that covers the overly negative connotation of "disagree" much better.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm not a fan of the "roll to settle player disagreement" idea, either.  For example, in a PTA series I produced - "Moon Town" - we had a conflict where the sheriff's goal was: "I stop the riot without using violence."  Now, there was no disagreement between me and Andy (the sheriff's player): it wasn't like I thought the story would be better if someone got killed in the riot and Andy thought that the story would be better if everything resolved peacefully.  Rather, we went to the cards in order to bring out and focus on thematic issues - which happened to relate to that character's big-"I" Issue of "Control".                        </div>

                            Ah! Jon reminds me now some of those previous conversations I had. And in so doing mostly shows me the error of my ways. He's saying -- and others are saying -- what I'm stubborning ignoring: That adversity between players is not <i>required</i> to define conflict. <br/><br/>It's interesting, because here's what's happening in Jon's example: <br/><br/>BOTH he and the player are saying the following: <br/><br/>We both agree that THIS THING is the issue at hand, unresolved (i.e. does the riot stop without violence?). AND we both agree to use fortune to decide that event, which means we assent to EITHER OUTCOME.<br/><br/>They are saying yes or ... saying yes. And they turn to fortune to decide which yes. <br/><br/>Cool. I get to cover my ass, because "different ideas about 'what happens next' " still fits that bill, as far as I can tell.                        </div>

                            Matt,<br/><br/><i>Sometimes</i> players do disagree with what they want to see happen. I concede that. But I don't believe that's the primary reason for rolling dice.<br/><br/>Consider this: Do we "disagree" because we really do want different things, or because our roles--as players--in the game demands that we move in different directions? An obvious example is if I'm the GM, I don't really want my demon to kill your knight. If he did, the game would end. But more than that, I want to see a story of bravery and victory, so I actually want to see your character whomp my demon's ass. But because my role is to antagonize your knight, I--as a player--must act in such a way and push in such a way that is counter to your knight's interests.<br/><br/>That's how I see it, at least.<br/><br/>[edit]<i> Cross-posted with Matt.</i> [/edit]                        </div>

                            In some games you roll dice to complicate matters or because nobody knows what should happen next (and the dice help you figure that out). I think <i>Otherkind</i> is a good example of this. <br/><br/>Also, while resolution systems resolve "conflict" (whether between players, characters, or what have you) they also have traditionally helped structure conflict, which is even more important. You move to use the system when it becomes important to keep track of whose turn it is and where people are positioned and who's doing what and so on.<br/><br/>Rolling dice also serves to emphasize important stuff (though it's not the only way).  In this, it's kinda like Bringing Down the Pain.  You move from freeform stuff to working with the mechanics.  Aha! This has mechanical significance.  In many systems, you roll dice when you want something to matter.                        </div>

                            Maybe I should amend my statement: "Roll dice (or invoke other mechanics) when anyone at the table doesn't want the proposed action to be a gimme."  Make the outcome uncertain when someone thinks it would be entertaining to do so, either because they want to see the action fail, have legitimate doubts about what should happen, or simply find the uncertainty appealing.                        </div>

                            Sufficiently Advanced's version: "If things aren't going the way you like, either activate a Plot Score or roll some dice." It's also intended to be a <i>very</i> smooth transition from ordinary storytime to dice-based conflict. First to declare = first to act, your effort-type points in each score are also your hit-type points, and everything works. It'll settle any kind of <i>character</i> dispute just fine.<br/><br/>Now if the <i>players</i> seriously disagree as to where they want the game to go, things could devolve into them using a shitton of plot points to rearrange the game world, taking a bunch of Complications to power them, and thus giving the GM near-total control over their characters. Strangely, this rarely happens in my games. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> People seem to prefer talking things over to telling the GM, "please kidnap my character, brainwash her, and have all my enemies escape unharmed."                        </div>

                            Why roll the dice?<br/>
<br/>
I think resolving different views on what should happen next is really secondary.<br/>
<br/>
In a roleplaying game, specifically one where players are trying to collaborate to produce a story, I started to say that the dice are rolled at what, in a story, would be a pinchpoint in the plot. After the dice rolls, something important will change and be irreversible, potentially unexpected, moving the story forward (this is a concept from screenwriting called the "dramatic event").<br/>
<br/>
At first when thinking about this, I imagined that the players together must estimate when such a pinchpoint is approaching. Then I thought about how in Trollbabe anyone can declare a conflict (dice rolling) at any time. I suddenly saw that, with the right rules, the very act of calling for a dice roll creates an event that produces irreversible change. Halleluja!<br/>
<br/>
So my answer is: roll the dice when you want to move the story forward.                        </div>

                            In our TSOY game, we tend to reach for the dice when we really want to "push" at the plot.  I mean, obviously, we roll to determine the outcome when we're engaging in a battle or in a test of skill, but we also use the dice almost as a signal to the GM and to each other that we've decided something is important and we're going to poke at it and see what happens.  <br/>
<br/>
AP example: My PC is talking to an NPC and the conversation is going around in circles a bit, so I say, "Ok, I really want to find out what the big bad secret in her past is that she keeps dancing around, so I'm going to do a Counsel check to see if I can get her to open up."  GM says, "Cool, she's going to passively resist."  We roll, I win, so NPC tells me she ran away from her family because they were criminals.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't HAVE to go to dice there.  I could have danced around the subject for a little longer with the NPC, and then decided she wasn't going to give up the goods, but that it wasn't that important.  Or I could have decided that it would be more interesting to push for the information later.  Or, I might have totally missed the idea that she was trying to hide something, and the story would have galloped merrily on (albeit in a different direction) with no one any the wiser.  It's like Alan says above -- you use the dice to create an event and assign importance to something, prodding the story in a direction you find interesting.                        </div>

Dice create random results. You use the dice whenever you are not sure, what should happen next. Either if you can't figure it out on your own or if you don't want to decide or if you disagree with another player.                        </div>

                            Well, I think I should make my point with more care.<br/>
<br/>
1) I see that when and why to roll dice (ie use a formal resolution system) depends on why you are playing. The reasons I read behind 1of3's response, and many others in this thread, all make assumptions about that. "not sure, what should happen next" betrays a different perspective than resolving conflicts between players or between characters. My own perspective (rolling when you want to push the story along) betrays my own preference. <br/>
<br/>
2) Forgive me, but I must use Forge-speak: when and why to roll the dice depend on what Creative Agenda you're trying to support. The triggers will be different depending on which you choose. A call for dice resolution can be an act of taking a stand and of the player putting guts on the line, or it can be a way to reinforce a model, or it can be a way of declaring the dramatic importance (to the player) of a moment. I imagine that each of the three agenda's has more than one use for dice resolution and that will further complicate things. <br/>
<br/>
3) What I wanted to share above was this insight: dice resolution can be passive, triggered when certain circumstances appear in the SIS or around the table, OR it can be active, used by the player to insert circumstances into the SIS. I think conditioning from years of rpgs has made that difficult for me to see until now.                        </div>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinball#Calvinball" rel="nofollow">Calvinball</a> is when play is improvised with disregard for impartiality and consistency.  The result can be productive and satisfying, but only sporadically so.  Formal rules and impartial randomizers focus play on desired results, and help players to accept setbacks as fairly determined.                        </div>
