Batman arrived in 1939.<br/><br/>That World Fair was the first one with a utopian, proto-disneyland theme-- "building the World Of Tomorrow". <br/>(Previous world's fairs had been a survey of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">status quo</span> of trade and industry.)<br/><br/>Iron Man 2 and the Captain America movie both use a thinly-disguised version of the fair as a central location.<br/><br/>Here's an excellent list of other examples: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_New_York_World's_Fair#Influence_on_later_literature_and_popular_culture" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_New_York_World's_Fair#Influence_on_later_literature_and_popular_culture</a><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The stock market's all-time low was in July 1932, down 89% from the peak before 1929's Black Friday crash.<br/><br/><br/>SO...  what if there had been a 1933 World Fair?  ...masterminded by a Magneto figure with a fascist Italian Futurist theme (celebrating the beauty of machine gun fire as the music of modernity, and "War, the World's Hygene"... <br/><a href="http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/war.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/war.html</a><br/><a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/T4PM/futurist-manifesto.html" rel="nofollow">http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/T4PM/futurist-manifesto.html</a><br/>Magneto would look like Darth Vader, because Darth Vader looks like a 1930's Italian Fascist Design Masterpiece, the Bugatti:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.2012bugatti.com/Bugatti-57-SC.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.instablogsimages.com/images/2009/01/03/1937-bugatti-type-57s_B59UC_52.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>Professor X would presumably be a very rich, but benevolent, man-- who sought to keep mutants from being a tool of fascist 'progress'.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Prohibition created a nationwide network of organized crime.  Which didn't confine itself to bootlegging, but infiltrated labor relations, politics, the judicial system.<br/><br/><br/>Where would that leave the individual mutants of the X-men?   They'd be a motley collection of have-nots, with extraordinary abilities, but with few legitimate opportunities.<br/><br/>The mutants would be Yeggs---  smalltime operators with only a tangental connection to Al Capone-style organized crime.<br/>John Dillinger was a Yegg, as were Bonnie &amp; Clyde... and the other bank robbers whose antics  caused J. Edgar Hoover to form the FBI to engage in a War On Crime.  And mutants.<br/><br/>The book Public Enemies says that the 1930s were a heydey for Yeggs because of the advent of the V-8 automobile and the machine gun.  These two things made a daring loner crook able to outrun and outgun cops-- still driving Model-T's and firing six-shooters.  Mutant powers would have the same effect.  (The Johnny Depp movie is ok, but the Public Enemies book really nails it.

Other people wanted nothing more than return to a time of peace and prosperity and were willing to do almost anything to try and keep things stable.<br/><br/>The depression really was global, though the mood and experiences were different.  The one major exception that I know of is Russia, which had almost completely isolated itself before the collapse, so it didn't suffer any significant losses.  The people were still suffering from other hardships though and economic growth was very costly and difficult on the citizens.<br/><br/>People were desperate and sometimes turned to horrific or brutal solutions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340117/#Comment_340117" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T23:23:17+00:00" title="August 22, 2011 11:23PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are going to have the mutants all be teenagers, then you could peg the sudden uptick in mutant births with the 1910s flu epidemic!

The key in my mind is that the ideology concerned should be moderately absurd and disconcerting when viewed in hindsight.<br/><br/>Though it started in 1928, Fordl\xe2ndia is something possible to borrow from.  Henry Ford tried to recreate America as he idealized it (the taming of the jungle was almost an afterthought and assumption on his part).  There was a recent book about the subject and several decent interviews with the author (Greg Grandin) can give a pretty good synopsis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
