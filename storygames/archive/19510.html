I'm a videogame writer, designer and game design teacher based in Sydney, Australia, but RPGs are my first love.<br/><br/>I\u2019m also one of those poor fools who gets sucked into the vortex of a new D&amp;D edition release. Got burned last time, but it\u2019s looking really strong this time out (and I\u2019ve had some hands-on experience via the playtest). There\u2019s something about D&amp;D that I find rather comforting, and it\u2019s great for bringing new players into the hobby, so it looks like it might be my RL game for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Of course it doesn\u2019t by default do all the great things that my favourite storygames do, but one of the great things about 5E is that it\u2019s been designed from the ground up to be modular and hackable, which makes changing things around probably the easiest it\u2019s ever been.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t have the final rules yet, of course. But I have the playtest rules and have read enough to understand where most of it is going, so I\u2019ve started working on some storygame hacks to push it in the directions I\u2019m interested in. (When the DMG comes out in November it will have some storygame mods in it, but I can\u2019t wait that long, and they probably won\u2019t cover all my needs in any case.)<br/><br/>Most of my hacks are versions of rules from Burning Wheel and FATE. On the straightforward side, I\u2019ll be using stuff like setting stakes for rolls and \u201cfailing forward\u201d (including the brilliant Enmity Clause from BW),but there are a few elements I\u2019d value your advice/feedback on). <br/><br/><b>1)  Invoking and Compelling (a la FATE)</b><br/><br/>Before I go into details, two little bits of background are required for any of you who know previous editions of D&amp;D but haven\u2019t yet looked at this one: <br/><br/>a) Fifth Edition has an Advantage/Disadvantage mechanic. If you have Advantage on a given roll, you get to roll 2d20 and take the highest. If you have disadvantage, you must roll 2d20 and take the lowest. This is designed to replace the myriad of small modifiers that existed in previous editions; And secondly<br/><br/>b) Fifth Edition by default uses a system of character Backgrounds, which add a third axis to the usual Race/Class combo. Backgrounds have an impact on things like Skill availability, but they also give the player tables of roleplaying elements called Traits, Ideals, Bonds and Flaws (which can either be chosen, randomly rolled or invented with DM consent). These will be pure story elements, and will not tie into the rules as such in the basic game, but there will be optional rules around them in the DMG. Here\u2019s a sample of what they look like for one specific Background: <a href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20140505" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20140505</a><br/><br/>So, here we have an Advantage mechanic and four character elements not dissimilar to Aspects - the perfect place to tie in some FATE-style shenanigans, methinks! The obvious thing would be to just throw the fate point economy into the game whole cloth, with Compels giving fate points and Invokes costing them and giving Advantage. I do not intend to do the obvious thing, because I\u2019d rather do the weird and interesting thing.<br/><br/>Here is the current version of my rules:<br/><br/>--<br/><br/><i>Invoking</i><br/>A player may Invoke their Trait, Ideal, Bond or Flaw by describing how it is beneficial to a check, attack roll or saving throw. If the GM agrees, they get Advantage on that roll. They may not Invoke the same Trait, Ideal, Bond or Flaw twice in the same game session.<br/><br/><i>Compelling</i><br/>The DM may put forward a bad/complicating event or situation that occurs to a specific PC based on their Trait, Ideal, Bond or Flaw. The DM then offers the player of that PC an XP award for agreeing to incorporate the complication into the story. This is called a Compel. The nature of the complication and the amount of XP awarded can be negotiated briefly. If agreement is reached, the player marks the XP award on their character sheet and the player or DM begin narrating the complication. Players may also suggest Compels for their own or other PCs, but the DM is always the final arbiter on what is appropriate and how much XP to award.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>That\u2019s it. As you can see, the Compel is the meat of the rules - it\u2019s the bit that I find exciting, but also potentially problematic. There\u2019s something about the D&amp;D power ramp-up that I find quite absurd. Even in 5E - where the ramp is much shallower than in previous editions - it feels like more than simple \u201cexperience\u201d that is carrying the PC up through the levels. And so I really dig the idea that the player may have to trade narrative predictability to get that power. I see it as a kind of Karmic statement: \u201cYes, you can find favour with the gods, but you will be drawn further and further into their chaotic schemes, and your actions will ripple out into the world in ways you did not expect, and which will probably horrify you\u201d.<br/><br/>Beyond Compels, XP would still be awarded for progressing through the adventure, although at a slower rate than the default, to offset the above rule. Beyond that, the main risks seem to be around getting player buy-in, applying the rule enough-but-not-much, and getting the XP award numbers right (these would probably have to scale by level). But I\u2019d really welcome your thoughts, opinions and suggestions on the matter.<br/><br/>Now for...<br/><br/><b>2)  Stakes in Combat</b><br/><br/>No, not the kind you kill vampires with. What I\u2019m looking for is a narrative variance to combat. So, for example, the PCs aren\u2019t going to die even if they lose the fight with the Kobold guards out the front of the cave, but they very well could when they come up against the Green Dragon itself. My thoughts on this are still somewhat unformed. Perhaps it\u2019s as simple as informing the players what the complication will be if they lose the fight, and giving them the chance to retreat if it makes story sense. Complications would be changes in the game world, reflecting the fact that the monsters went undefeated and were thus able to progress their own sinister plans (I got this idea from the Campaign Loss rules in 13th Age). The option I can think of is having the players and their opponents decide on intent, and comparing them to work out what the stakes are (kind of similar to Torchbearer). I\u2019m not sure that this will work very well with D&amp;D-style combat and adventure design, though (yes, I\u2019ll probably be running published adventures, at least at first).<br/><br/>Anyway - suggestions welcome here. Has anyone done anything like this in the past that you can link me to?<br/><br/>EDIT: As a side-note to this point: I like the idea that combats don't have to go until everyone on one side is on the floor, but also that it's not always just an arbitrary DM decision when the monsters turn and run. Anyone seen any simple and solid morale systems for D&amp;D? (I'm thinking something related to Wisdom checks, but there are questions around when they're made and which creature's Wis you'd use, etc.)<br/><br/>And lastly\u2026<br/><br/><b>3)  Abstracted Currency</b><br/><br/>I\u2019m still on the fence about whether to use an abstract money system instead of tracking gold pieces. On the one hand, tracking coins is boring. But on the other, I wouldn\u2019t want to add something that wasn\u2019t pretty simple to insert, and I haven\u2019t come up with any ideas I really like just yet. So once again - suggestions or links to existing ideas would be very welcome.<br/><br/>That\u2019s about it for now. Thanks in advance for any help you can throw my way!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433816/#Comment_433816" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T07:22:26+00:00" title="June 14, 2014  7:22AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe for stakes in combat, the stakes have Hit Points just like a monster.

Or is some combination of tracking encumbrance, tracking illiquid assets (a jade statuette; coins from a land no one's heard of; illithid hearts) and tracking small transactions boring? I can't speak for others, but I never minded buying things that cost 1-10 GP with a budget of 25 GP ... it was buying things that cost 0.01-250 GP with a budget of 250 GP that drove me crazy.<br/><br/>An easy way to get rid of small transactions might be to track treasure to two significant figures - if you've got 110 GP and earn or spend 9 GP, you still have 110 GP. If that's too undifferentiated, maybe track to three significant figures. Then someone with 1000 gold can buy as many flint &amp; tinders as they like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433819/#Comment_433819" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T08:00:47+00:00" title="June 14, 2014  8:00AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2014 8:02AM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An idea for abstracted expenditures...  I agree that tracking small expenditures against a large budget (anything two orders of magnitude or more) can get kinda ridiculous and boring.  Often these types of expenditures are seen in "gearing up" prior to an adventure, buying a bunch of relatively cheap things like rope, torches, etc.  So a way to abstract that is to have a few different "kits" of varying "quality levels" (say, quality 1 through 5, with 5 being best).  Each of these kits includes a bunch of "standard adventurer gear" and costs a nice round amount of GP.  Easy math.<br/><br/>Once purchased, rather than counting how many torches, how many feet of rope, how many pitons, etc, you simply have the player roll against the quality level of the kit whenever they want to produce something it might reasonably hold.  This works rather like the "Fucking Thieves" move in AW.<br/><br/>"I'm pulling out two pitons and a hammer"<br/>"Ok roll your kit quality or lower on a d6."<br/>"Woops I missed the roll by 1"<br/>"Ok you have a hammer but only one piton."<br/><br/>Of course if a player doesn't like the randomness and chooses to be anal about tracking, let them buy the items individually and track it all themselves.  The devil is in the details, and that's his price.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moonkid" title="moonkid"><img alt="moonkid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moonkid">moonkid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433848/#Comment_433848" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-15T05:28:37+00:00" title="June 15, 2014  5:28AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the ideas, guys.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Judd">@Judd</a>: That's a really interesting train of thought. I'll have a think about it, and see if something along these lines will be feasible in the adventures I'm looking to run.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Aslf">@Aslf</a>: The game is actually pushing along these lines already. It doesn't include the random element, but there is a thing called an Adventurer's Kit in the playtest rules, which includes a whole bunch of "standard" adventuring guff, including 10 torches, 10 rations and rope. I'll probably go with that, except that I may give infinite supplies of the numbered items. Not too keen to track torches. The other thing I'll probably do is give out treasure in much lower quantities than the suggested default, which should make that gp tracking less of a menial chore (and bring out a bit of that "murder hobo" vibe that I like so much in Torchbearer).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433849/#Comment_433849" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-15T07:43:05+00:00" title="June 15, 2014  7:43AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Stakes</b> in combat sounds like it'd be super meta, so maybe really pull certain types of players out of the story. If you want more metagaming going on, as that seems like what the compels might do to a lesser degree, I think it could be a lot of fun. Personally I lean bit that way myself and I dig the compel/invoke add-on. In my game, Magicians, an enemy only has a point pool that shoes their threat to the players or agency in the fiction. So as you whittle them down you're effectively reducing how much control and presence they have in the story or in that scene. <br/><br/>Only thing is, you could just do that anyway with HP, right? In my mind, you don't need to tell the players about the stakes, just have stuff happen and implications for loss can be implied without being another number to hack away at. If monsters aren't defeated, I'd be moving them around according to their motivations regardless of what the stakes were. All enemies should have motivations in my mind, regardless of the mechanic involved in resolving them. Maybe just have clearer expectations and motivations for how enemies will work opposed to what the players might thing D&amp;D might normally be like (if they just want to run around killing stuff and taking their stuff).<br/><br/>As for <b>Currency</b>, I always dug Burning Wheel's Resource stat, and getting bonuses to the roll depending on the loot you have. Maybe just set up a difficulty ladder for what they want to procure (assuming it can be gotten in the first place and taking into account where they are, how they get it, etc.) and have them roll, the more loot they have the bigger the bonus to the roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433852/#Comment_433852" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-15T08:13:52+00:00" title="June 15, 2014  8:13AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was running D&amp;D 4E, I borrowed Rob Donoghue's idea of <a href="http://rdonoghue.blogspot.com/2011/01/fighting-situation.html" rel="nofollow">giving everything hit points</a>. Need to disarm the trap that's barring your way while your friends hold off the onrushing hordes? Give the trap 20 hit points, and every time you make your Disarm Traps roll, make an Int-based damage roll until you're done. "Almost there...almost...got it, guys! Let's go!" It works really well for adding situational context to a fight, for giving non-fighty types spotlight time during the battle, and for making combat about more than just swinging until one side goes down or runs away.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moonkid" title="moonkid"><img alt="moonkid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moonkid">moonkid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433885/#Comment_433885" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-15T23:53:50+00:00" title="June 15, 2014 11:53PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/kksimons">@kksimons</a>: I'm still unsure about stakes.
