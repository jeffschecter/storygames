In fact the character began quite enthusiastically, but things have not gone his way.  In the first session you hit pretty hard and you may have missed, set aside, or just ignored his signals for desired game experiences.  Maybe they didn't make sense to you.  Maybe you were railroading a little bit.  In the second session maybe he failed some important rolls, maybe you took away some stuff he felt he couldn't do without.  That can't be undone, because the fiction has moved on from that point.  Now, feeling like there's no way for him to progress his goals in this game, or no point in trying to do so, he expresses a sincere wish for his character to kill himself.<br/><br/>How do you feel?

Whether the game continues or not depends on the creative position of the player in the game, the game's nature, etc. If the game continues, the suicide statement is likely to be ignored as insignificant because the game continuing despite extreme protest implies that the player/character in question wasn't very important in the first place.<br/><br/>If it's an attempt to get rid of the character to get to play a different one (this dynamic occurs on occasion in some types of games), then it depends on the game in question. In all the games I've played where something like this might occur, it's generally been a better idea to just tell the player that they can retire the character and make a new one. If the suicide is unmotivated by in-game causality, it's an unnecessary event where many alternatives exist as well.<br/><br/>In addition to the practical handling of the suicidal intent, I'd pay attention to the actual issue of the character being frustrated by the dice. The suicide is just a reaction to player frustration here, after all, and by itself irrelevant. It is possible that the game is wrong (or played wrong) and the player is justifiably frustrated, or that the player is unsuited to the game, which is functioning as it's supposed to. Either case, it's good to figure it out in case there's something that could and should be fixed for the future.<br/><br/>It should be emphasized that this is just for your specific scenario. Characters have occasionally chosen suicide in our drama games as legit game moves taken by players, for example. Similarly, sometimes external forces drive a character to suicide. These in-play events are different from a player choosing character suicide because they don't like how the game is progressing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432022/#Comment_432022" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-03T00:08:02+00:00" title="May  3, 2014 12:08AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game be damned.

Or is another player (yourself, or someone else) causing this situation for this person?<br/><br/>"What would make this character interesting to play?" can be a good question once you've ascertained that the player is not in danger and he or she still wants to continue playing with you/the group. Perhaps the player would enjoy it if the character became a villain or some such reversal of roles. (If it's genre-appropriate, a beautiful character who is defaced might be a fun "bad guy" for either the player or the GM to play.)<br/><br/><br/>*: As difficult and counterintuitive as it may seem, the best thing to do is to ask the player as directly as possible. "I'm concerned about you. Are you thinking about suicide, ending your own life?"<br/><br/>It's a good question to ask because the person should respond with a clear and definite "no". If they give any other response... they need help. Try to stay with them if possible and get them in touch with a professional who can help them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432025/#Comment_432025" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-03T00:30:28+00:00" title="May  3, 2014 12:30AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2014 12:46AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For sure.

I don't even think it matters what their reasons are. Ditch the old character and bring in a new one, definitely.<br/><br/>BUT: it is far, far, FAR more important for everyone at the table to put their efforts towards making the NEW character work in the game than it is for them to do anything with the old one. It literally does not fucking matter what happens to the old character. Maybe he won the lottery and moved to a private island. Maybe he got thrown in prison for tax evasion. Maybe he got a real job. Maybe he was just a hallucination brought on by a bit of bad beef. Maybe he died on his way back to his home planet. <i>It doesn't matter.</i> Any work put into explaining where the old character went is entirely wasted and should have been directed towards making the new character fit in as seamlessly as possible.<br/><br/>So, here's the billion-dollar-question: is the character's suicide in service of something? Is it meant to be a denouement or conclusion to some tragic story about this character who tried but failed spectacularly? Is it meant to be something that the other characters will have to deal with? Is it important to the backstory of the player's next character? What, specifically, requires that character to commit suicide rather than just being shuffled offstage with a minimum of fuss?<br/><br/>If the answer is "Nothing, really, I just wanted this character to kill himself because I want to play a new guy," then let the player know that "I want to play a new guy" is the only thing that ever needed to be said. If it's for the backstory of the new character, well, your call on whether that's a good idea or not. If it's meant to be something the other characters have to deal with, then maybe the other players should be the ones who decide if that's something they're interested in or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432028/#Comment_432028" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-03T01:33:11+00:00" title="May  3, 2014  1:33AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2014 1:33AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really excellent answer, <a href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">@AccountingForTaste</a>.

I thought maybe it was a way of bowing out gracefully.<br/> I've been fortunate never to have the "jerk" player who ruined everybody's fun because of their own dissatisfaction; but I have had the "silly" player who introduced odd things to spice the game up (spontaneously being possessed by the spirit of Babe Ruth in a dark fantasy setting; amusing but inappropriate - he bowed out after that).<br/><br/> And while I was thinking about the various ways players have expressed dissatisfaction through their characters I remembered that <i>I, myself,</i> was the "Suicide is Painless" player back in high school - without any real-life self-harm issues.<br/><br/> It was actually death by combat. Briefly, the DM kept having some evil Noble Lady call on Champions to kill my Paladin. I wasn't backing down. After killing the first two I could see where this was going. The third killed Sir Loin (or whatever his name was) and I bowed and flourished and said "Thus ends the legend of Sir Loin" (or who ever), thanked the DM for the game and went out to the smoking area at school.<br/>  Basically, we both had our balls out to see who's were brassier. Killing my character seemed a good way to bow out, in-game, in character, without any fuss or hard feelings. I actually went on to game with three of the other players for the rest of high school.<br/><br/>  Now, I fully concede that this probably isn't the way grown-up elves and dwarves should behave. But, at the time and in those circumstances, it was not only a viable option, it was an excellent one.

Thoughts?</blockquote>\nPersonally, I generally try for operative procedures that work. Blame-assignation is rarely an useful primary process. Rather, it's better to attempt to figure out what happens, what the dynamics are, and fix them. The question is whether the game is proceeding as intended, and how to answer to the player move either in case it is or in case it isn't. It's a social engineering issue, and in that terminology we simply don't have blame - we have causality, and as often as not the reason for why we ended up with a problem is in the individually justified viewpoints of the participants becoming problematic when they interact with each other. Blame the system, I guess, if something absolutely has to be blamed.<br/><br/>"Blame" is political bullshit irrelevant to gaming as often as not, because it's only useful as a solution for high-stakes social situations where it's more important to maintain social cohesion in the ranks than to maintain social capital. By assigning a guilty party you draw attention away from the problem through ostracism and consequential white-washing (the party whence guilt is assigned can e.g. ask for forgiveness of the community and promise not to cause the situation again); this process makes sense when you can sacrifice a degree of personal loyalty by punishing somebody, and thus gain a renewed sense of purpose and direction with everybody else in the community.<br/><br/>For example, if you found that a player or several were being deeply unhappy with a game, and you decided that it's better to end it, and you wanted to save everybody from recriminations and feelings of frustration, then you might want to identify the issue in public and take the blame yourself. By doing that, and consequently bowing out, you leave the rest of the group psychologically less distressed than if you merely identified the issue and then left it to hang about, oppressing the participants and causing them doubts about their worth as human beings or the worth of the hobby itself. When they have a scapegoat, they can go into their next game with somebody else as happy and accomplished individuals - that last failure was not their fault, or fault of the game. Assigning blame to somebody else can have similar purposes.<br/><br/>Obviously I don't think that scapegoating is a too elegant means of handling the feelings of failure and frustration. It salves the symptoms while ignoring the causes. A mature group committed to excellence in gaming should be able to be blame-agnostic about observing what's wrong and fixing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432100/#Comment_432100" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-04T20:57:25+00:00" title="May  4, 2014  8:57PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very well said.

A problem is almost always too complex that you can't sort out one single factor and blame that. It's a common human behavior to simplify/categorize to make it easier to understand (and remember; one reason why stereotypes are born) but scapegoating is an example of when that backfires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432108/#Comment_432108" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-05T05:15:00+00:00" title="May  5, 2014  5:15AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2014 5:15AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            /nods.

However I'm not sure if I want to be totally open about my personal experiences of running Dungeons &amp; Dragons while depressed: pity parties aren't my bag.

(Of course, the person posting will know who wrote what, but no one else who is reading will know.) The people sharing their experiences, once they saw that they were well received, could reveal themselves and respond to questions, say thank you, or clarify things, if they so wished.<br/><br/>Once again, a moderator could be a good choice.<br/><br/>(I don't know if I'm a "trusted person" (certainly wouldn't want to presume so), but I'm ready to volunteer for this purpose, if that's desired.

And in each incident they got to the brink and nearly did commit suicide.  However it strongly fit their character design and the place in the plot itself.<br/><br/>I've had one character actually commit suicide but it was a Lovecraftian situation where the alternative was so terrible death became a superior alternative.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432460/#Comment_432460" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-12T11:24:33+00:00" title="May 12, 2014 11:24AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been off-line for a bit so I've not had a chance to follow this thread, except to make a silly comment, but I've got some thoughts on both this and Potemkin's breakout thread. Apologies if I don't address all the comments here, or if I replicate some of them. First though:\n<blockquote>I'd also like to add that this thread should be referred to as some kind of standard for Story Games/forum quality.<br/><br/>It began with a rather complex and sensitive question (the kind that could, on other occasions, make the internet explode), and <i>within the first five posts</i> we'd covered almost all the important points, as well as offered a slew of concise and useful advice.<br/><br/>Since then, we'll also heard an interesting and unusual gaming story, some humour, a couple of extremely profound observations on human nature, and finally lots of mutual love going around.<br/><br/>All that without even a full *page* of replies yet?<br/><br/>Folks, this is what the internet should be like.</blockquote>\nYes, absolutely!! So it <i>is</i> possible.<br/><br/>Ok, my thoughts:<br/><br/>No, I haven't ever thought about committing suicide in-character, but I can how it might make sense. I can forex see how <a href="/forums/profile/WPTunes%27">@WPTunes'</a> scenario might arise: I'm currently somewhere near the middle of a campaign that according to the GM has been planned to last about two years. I realise that, as Old Skewl campaigns go, that's pretty small beer, but, as folks will probably be aware by now, I'm not in my nature an Old Skewl gamer; however, if I felt frustrated with a campaign that didn't appear to be going anywhere, I hope I'd be able to simply say to the GM that I wanted out. Of course, realise that some folks might feel unable to communicate that to the GM directly and so fall back on a nuclear option such as in-character suicide (hereafter ICS). And I agree with Eero that, like the 'real thing', it's usually a cry for help that a competent GM should be able to recognise and respond to before it gets that far.<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed a fair amount however is something that you might call <i>collective suicide</i>, i.e. the whole gaming group- including the GM- or maybe the GM alone but with the tacit connivance of the player party, engineering a party wipe, or TPK. When I first heard someone say the GM had engineered a TPK in order to bring to a halt an adventure that had come t a dead end, I thought how strange. But then on reflection I realised that it's one way- albeit an extreme one- of dealing with this type of situation.<br/><br/>Ok, now the non-bleed character suicide, the kind where it seems appropriate to the player <i>mechanically</i>. I can see how this could be appropriate with games that prize qualities like honour (ASoIaF/Pendragon etc.), so ok, but there should be a mechanic, or a GM plot device, such that the player concerned, if he/she feels that at that point in the adventure the character has no other choice but to accept death, has a number of options open to them following (taking over a lead NPC, rolling up a new character relatively quickly and painlessly etc.). Also, assuming I'd determined that the action was character/plot-driven, and not bleed, I might build the death into the story, by having a ceremonial burial say, or suggesting that the other characters might like to make some comment on how they feel about the situation (one of the other characters might have an unspoken bond with the suicide, or pact, or there might be a resulting loyalty re-alignment in the game), in other words showing that the act could have wider repercussions for the greater story. <br/><br/>Ok, that wraps up character death. For mental health issues, I'll migrate to the other thread- see y'all there........                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
