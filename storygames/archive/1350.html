                    Here's the deal: I'm one of an 'elite' group -- the ones who did/could/would not submit a game for RevEng.  My reasons are varied, as are everyone else's.  My failure to submit inspired this thread idea, but it's not what it's about.<br/>
<br/>
What I want to start discussing is the <i>specific</i> challenges &amp; joys you faced during designing your game -- whether it got submitted or not.  The field is wide-open.  I'd really like to hear from 'both sides of the fence', as it were.  Because well, y'know, that's how damned dirty hippie communities are s'posed to work, right?<br/>
<br/>
One ground-rules for posting to this thread, ok?<br/>
<br/>
1.  If it's your first post about your <i>own</i> design, please lead the post with a link to the character sheet,  and a link to any design material (if possible).<br/>

                            Sheet: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Russell%20Collins.pdf" rel="nofollow">Russel Collins'</a>  'Labrynth'<br/>
Design: none!<br/>
<br/>
caveat: Russel, this is in <i>no way</i> a slam against you.  Consider the lack of a game a testament to my inability to step up to the task.  I'm not saying that you made the task easy, but the responsibility lies squarely on my shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Awesomeness</b><br/>
Yay!  a board, or something like a board.  COOL.<br/>
<br/>
Board is tied to some sort of resource/ability (via numbers). Also cool.<br/>
<br/>
Some subtle introduction of colour via "thy" instead of "your" or "the" in the title place-holder.  Couple that with the font selection, and the game definitely took on an 'olde-worlde' feel to me.  Good guidance.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Challenges</b><br/>
<i>Overly-constrained</i>.  Wow.  It looked so touchy-feely at first blush.  But man, once I got into it, it felt like I was hitting a wall at every turn.  Like what you ask?  It's all about reading the inferred meaning in the graphic design.  Obvious stuff is the numerical link between the labrynth and the lower section of the page.  The concept of a labrynth is in itself constraining.  Title/Being/Home is tough to work in a meaningful (read: not just colour) fashion.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Hidden Pitfall</i>.  That 1-16 numbering scheme is a <i>pain in the ass</i>.  Doesn't map to a nice die mechanic, and even worse: the numbers in the Labrynth don't map to a meaningful pattern when compared with: Desires / Insights, Exertion / Resistance, Individual rows, or Numerical Columns.  This is probably the biggest hurdle I tried tackling.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Personal Creative Block</i>.  I think this entry is probably another item under "Overly Constrained", but it holds a special place in my heart.  Incorporating "Identify" into everything else.  I mean, man.  Normally something like this spurs me to new creative heights, but I couldn't see my way out.  And I did get help, <i>and</i> I spitballed with plenty of folks.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Whitespace Weirdness</i>.  The complete lack of whitespace around the "Emergence" and "Entrance" really stumped me.  There's no place to record anything, so they really become non-starters.  Why are they on the sheet?  Then, there are apparently <i>three</i> of each?  Colour me stumped.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Thoughts</b><br/>
I guess it really amounted to me not feeling like there was <i>any</i> creative wiggle room -- at least, not for an RPG.  I had several really good core ideas for board games, but nothing that would support a Nar, Sim, or Gam RP agenda.<br/>
<br/>
There is this one awesome thing that came out of the whole process for me:  Those horizontal lines next to the Desire and Identify tags got me thinking in terms of using Continuums instead of numbers/words/etc.  If each player had a colour of counter, then use those to record <i>relative</i> levels within each continuum.  Cool!                        </div>

A multiplicity of ideas seemed to pour forth from it the moment I saw it, and none of them got firmly slapped down by the sheet, just redirected somewhat.<br><br>The clock, light and dark, and "Form" lines shoved lycanthropy to the forefront, but I didn't really groove to that, and there were so many ideas to choose from.<br><br>The "moment" that grabbed me was the idea of a clock striking midnight and terrible things happening. Now the sheet represents a countdown to that moment. Cool.<br><br>What am I going to do about the four corners? IS it a single sheet for four people? No, because then the words should all be upside-down so as to face the nearest player properly. Should it be folded into quarters? No, becuase then the roman numerals would be upside down for two of them. Maybe I play two characters at once. One light, and one dark. And then at some point I turn it upside-down and play two different characters. One attacking, one defending? And the characters transform midway through? OK, that's all neat.<br><br>Clock + dark attackers + countdown to midnight = haunted house.<br><br>I'm clearly supposed to record something in each pie slice. I don't have a good idea for that one. But I like the idea of a countdown. We'll see.<br><br>Then I got busy at Real Life for a good week or so. On revisit, I remembered how excited I was by the sheet. I love that.<br><br>I made a list of things I wanted to encourage the players to do. I wanted an expendable resource players had to decide whether to use on attack or defense. I didn't want dice clattering around, didn't seem to fit the mood. I want the players to actively screw over each others' characters. Etc.<br><br>Then I started messing with mechanics to steer players toward all that. The anchor was that "moment" at the end where the clock strikes midnight and we see what happens. I latched onto the notion of having a semi-unpredicable ending that rolled the suspense out. I <i>think</i> I nailed that. Then I worked backward from that, deciding how to reward players throughout by angling "good" play toward a strong position in the endgame.<br><br>I didn't have any terrible sticking moments, but I think that's largely because I was given a great frame width, and I didn't get to a playtesting phase where I'd have to face sticky issues that arise when you see what actually happens to your ideas when put into practice.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Hmmm, -- I should do something with that.  I tried using the four big empty areas for different character portraits, but that idea kinda fizzled out.<br/><br/>I think I was feeling a bit contrarian in the beginning.  Yes, the sheet gives me Hunger, Burden, Threads, and a big maze.  But did I take a cue from that?  If anything, I recoiled from it.  But the more I thought it over, the more those themes started to sink in.<br/><br/>What should a game with this character sheet be about?  Being trapped, or perhaps rescuing others who are trapped, or perhaps both.  That idea seemed to have some promise, so I thought it over for a goodly while.<br/><br/>My first inclination was to make the PCs bound demons of some sort, under the thumb of a tyrannical GM.  But that felt sorta flat and derivative and generally not something I felt like writing.  Best file it away for some other rainy day.<br/><br/>I continued to think over the theme of being trapped, and all at once I thought, "Hey... that Sartre play, No Exit, is about being trapped."  I re-read the play and a few ideas started to congeal.  It would be something different, anyway.<br/><br/>About a day before the deadline, I still had nothing written.  I was feeling like bailing out on the whole thing.  Then I figured, hey, I should feel a sense of obligation about this whole thing.  It's not like I didn't have an idea of where to go with it.  So I opened up a text file and just started writing.<br/><br/>A year or so ago I remember thinking, "If one wrote an explicit-enough example-of-play, that would be sufficient.  The rules and the game would be defined by it."  So I started with these players talking about the game.  They never actually got the chance to play it, but I still think it sorta served its purpose.<br/><br/>I hit a bit of a wall when I got to the nitty-gritty mechanics of how the system actually works.  But by then I had a pretty good idea of how I wanted it to work.  And the character sheet gave me some useful structure here, too:  I knew the only real stats I had were Hunger and Burden.  So I mentally fiddled with how I wanted things to work out, ran a few gedankenexperiments, and eventually hacked it out.<br/><br/>The rules summary pretty much wrote itself.<br/><br/>In terms of what I take away from this process at this point:  1)  Keep churning through ideas until you find something that catches your interest.  2)  It's easier to continue writing than it is to start writing.  3)  Sometimes it's best not to talk about these sorts of things too early in the process.  It lets the magic out.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Sheet: <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/andrewkenrick.pdf" rel="nofollow">Andrew Kenrick</a><br/><br/>Game: <a href="http://www.wurb.com/~carl/cubit/" rel="nofollow">Cubit</a>
<p>So, this was one of those really open-ended sheets, with little more than a collection of mysterious shapes.  No decoration to suggest a theme or genre, no labels to suggest gameplay mechanics, except for one thing: instructions to assemble it into a cube and "roll your character sheet".  Having only one guidepost, it immediately started to chafe.  How dare the sheet designer tell the players what to do!  Only I have that authority!<br/><br/></p><p>So I subverted that instruction, interpreting "roll" as a way to move a cube around on a grid by measured steps.  And, having established that you'd be moving things around on a grid, it almost inevitably became a combat-oriented miniatures game.  This is almost certainly not what Mr. Kenrick was imagining would be done with his mysterious shapes, but it all kind of seemed to follow naturally at the time.<br/><br/></p><p>Once I'd decided on this sort of game, I started noticing all the things that the sheet didn't have.  Like places to record hit points or experience, or even the character's name.  Oh, sure, I could just designate the side with the rounded rectangle on it to be you "name tag" side, but that seemed inelegant.  If you're going to go to the trouble of folding your character sheet into a cube, it had better be important that it's a cube.  That means that anything you write on a side is specific to that side, which means that the rules can never require keeping track of non-side-specific information.  Not even a name.  I took pains to make sure that everything you write on your cube is actually affected by the cube's orientation, and that everything that isn't affected by the cube's orientation was simple enough to not require writing down.<br/><br/></p><p>Now, the tactical system I had come up with to use these cubes was kind of interesting, but this isn't a board-game contest.  This cube-rolling had to fit into a story.  In order to make it plausible as a simulation of what's going on physically in the game world, it had to be a pretty weird game world.  And so it is.  This is perhaps another level of "reversed engineering" in this game: the details of the game world were chosen to fit the decided-on mechanics, rather than vice versa.<br/><br/></p><p>One of the joys of creating an alien environment out of nothing is that you can make it a better fit to gameplay than the real world.  I know that players have lengthy strategy discussions in between combat rounds, so I provided an in-game justification for it.<br/><br/></p><p>I have a vague idea of the kind of thing that I would have done if I had decided to just roll the cube like a die, the way it was obviously intended.  That would have supported a much more abstract form of gameplay -- say, one where each of the six shapes represents a different kind of role in the story, and all the players roll their cubes simultaneously to find out what kind of things their characters are required to do in the next scene.  That might have been a better game, but I'm glad I did it the way I did, because I'm pleased with the game world.</p> </div>

                            One more thing:  Over the course of the two week design phase, I described my basic ideas to several people.  Every one of them had a different take on what you could do with rolling cubes, and made all sorts of suggestions that were incompatible with my design.  I think there is a lot of unexplored potential here.                        </div>

Quite the opposite in that respect, actually.<br/><br/>See, Mark Nau's wonderful character sheet jumped at me from the moment I opened the .pdf. I saw the rainbow colored blocks and though immediately of a rainbow with the pot of gold, and from there, Leprechauns. The empty slots obviously meant that each color meant something, but it would be different for each character. Secondly, the Hope, Duty, Fear, and Fate slots gave me a military feel, and immediately the idea of Leprechauns in WWII landed in my lap. It's a cross between Disney's <i>Darby O'Gill and the Little People</i> and the WWII movie, <i>Kelly's Heroes</i>: Darby's Heroes.<br/><br/>Opposite of most people's reactions, the ideas were literally flowing non-stop for me, and the real frustration was how little time I had to write. Of the two weekends  I had in the two weeks to write, one was spent at a gaming convention, and the other was spent out of town. It felt rushed to write, and I believe reads like it was rushed.<br/><br/>The final product I turned in....I'm not satisfied with. It has no editing beyond a basic spell check, the layout is the bare minimum, and there is so much I wanted to include that was left out, or else included but in stripped down form. I believe the idea is solid however, and I want to revisit my green friends in a month or two and give it the attention it deserves. Particularly, it seems a glaring omission now that I didn't include some use for gold coins in play.<br/><br/>As to the process of the Reverse Engineering? I love it! It's a challenge and a great mental exercise. I'm truly impressed by the different character sheets submitted, and the amazing games created from them. I've learned a lot about game design in these all-too-short weeks by simply watching the genesis of brilliant ideas. I will eagerly join the next Rev/Eng challenge. Kevin is a brilliant goblin for coming up with this idea.                        </div>

                            Sheet: Paoletta<br/>Game: Children of the Sun, Children of the Moon<br/>I'll put up links when I can think straight enough to host 'em.<br/><br/>I had great fun with this. What screwed me up was thinking of the game as a board game. There was a great temptation to never let role-playing in. I guess when the mechanics come so fast and the story comes slow that's a by-product.<br/><br/>I don't have nearly enough free time to do this stuff. This will likely be my last contest entry for a long, long while.                        </div>

                            Sheet: Meguey Baker<br/>Game: FateClock<br/><br/>Practical approach, looking at the sheet:<br/><br/>"I am... I see... I feel... I want..." - is all about who "I" am in the game, the "character".<br/><br/>"Rider" is something in movement, maybe something moving the "I"? Ah, a game of possession!<br/><br/>"Ridden" is movement too, maybe both by the "I" and the "Rider"? Each Ridden has a corresponding Rider. Ah, the Rider is a leader, and the Ridden is his subjects to command/guide!<br/><br/>There's six Rider/Ridden, so this may be a game of transforming characters. The central "Fate Clock" indicates some sort of countdown may be involved. Ah, a game of history, going through six epochs, towards a fated end!<br/><br/>"______________ knows my name" is all about the name not having a space on this sheet. So maybe it is hidden, but one of the other players know it? Ah, the name is spoken at game end!<br/><br/>Oh, there's some circles in the upper right corner... forgot about them. Well, they don't have to matter much. I'll just ignore them. Let them be a space free for the players to doodle in!<br/><br/>And then it was all about writing the game. Had a great time doing it!

                            Sheet Karynax located at http://www.geocities.com/karynax23/reverse-rpg-v1.1.pdf <br/>
My Game Take A Bite (not posted anywhere but will email and will post somewhere<br/>
<br/>
Well I found this forum the day after the deadline for the character sheet. So I didnt participate.<br/>
In talking on the main topic thread Karynax was kind enough to let me play with his sheet since it seemed like his was not received with the rest, eaten by some email monster or somesuch.<br/>
<br/>
So he offered it to me.<br/>
When I first opened it and saw Fnord I was stuck on Warehouse 23, GURPS, Illuminati and could think of nothign else.<br/>
Throw in work issues, personal trials and travails, and it did not flow the way I wanted it to.<br/>
I started in one direction, made a huge turn, then back close to the original idea but haphazard like<br/>
<br/>
So I did a bunch of searching on Eris, got so lost following Wiki links I almost didnt make it back to the character sheet.<br/>
<br/>
I really drew a blank with all of it. Ended up with a mechanicless too rules lite haphazard mess. No prettiness, no theme besides fighting against mindless Bureaucracies and implied rebellion with scant ideas.<br/>
It came in a few k worth of words, and not near as good as i would have liked it. <br/>
In retrospect I would have not done well with the character sheet, looking at ones i have done before, i am a lot more rules heavy and less innovative mechanics than most on here. <br/>
But I appreciate him letting me abuse his sheet, and I did email the sheet and game to Kevin for potential completeness sake.                        </div>

                            Well the game files are avialable to yahoo users,<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/Etherium-game/files/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/Etherium-game/files/</a><br/>
<br/>
and I had Kirk Mitchell's sheet, <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/kirkmitchell.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/kirkmitchell.pdf</a> for the contest.<br/>
<br/>
My initial impulse was to do a game somewhere between Call of Cthulhu and Teenagers from Outerspace.<br/>
<br/>
My second impulse was to make it a 1970's period piece dealing with a college campus that was sucked into a pocket dimension because of a series of experiements in remote viewing, sleep  deprivation, and altered states of consciousness triggering an incident.  There were pregenerated characters that people chose from to play.  But, it started seeming too much like LOST from television, so I trashed that one on the fourth day.<br/>
<br/>
The third idea, I stuck with.  I worked in mechanics to deal with which player had the lead, and how to resolve in-game actions.  I had a bunch of background information that didn't make it.  Stuff about different views of what the Etherium was and what the character aspects were barely get a nod.  I didn't get to include setting elements like Tophet or go into a detailed explanation of Thohu wa-bhohu and what the concept means to certain in-game groups.   I didn't get to go into all the details of symbolic existence, and simply gave a list of references I had been using when I had initially worked on the idea of the Symbolic Signature.<br/>
<br/>
A stumbling block for me was where to draw the line for player control of another players Construct.  I went back and forth on that one.  I finalized that on Tuesday.  Another stumbling block was in the mechanic I designed, it completley limits the number of players to factors of 12.  I removed the options for 1 and 12 players for game logistics reasons, we were on a two week deadline after all.<br/>
<br/>
What I liked best?  The group interactive character generation. The sheet tended to lend itself to surveying.  The players don't have to agree about their characters' backgrounds, but the players do have to view another character based on the principles outlined by that character's player on the Persona Survey (a.k.a. character sheet).  The same player can have his or her character seen differently by all the other players.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The sheet was definitely in my top ten favorites and I feel lucky to have gotten it.<br/>
<br/>

                            Looking back..... in Shame!<br><br>Sheet: <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/benlehman.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ben Lehman</a><br>My incomplete game: <a href="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/GreaterEvils.pdf" rel="nofollow">Greater Evils</a><br><br><b>Challenges:</b> So, Ben's sheet was pretty damn minimalistic, just a squiggly line and two shapes.  It suggested a number of interesting <i>mechanics</i> to me, but none of those suggested any particular <i>game</i> so I ran around in circles bouncing between ideas and wasting time.  I blame insufficient constraints. <br><br><b>Approach:</b>  In the end, I found inspiration by being contrary.  Rather than going for some sort of foofy narrative currency-shifting game I wondered if i could turn it into a shamelessly crunchy, gamist game.  That ended up clicking pretty hard, and I started totally riffing on console games, trying to create something that had lots of fighty, captured the progressions from town to dungeon to town and completely left room for upgrades.<br><br><b>Resolution:</b> Sadly, inspiration came too late, and it turned out I misremembered the closing date, so I spent most of the 14th on a writing sprint which still didn't quite work.  Characters, gear and the basic structure of play are in place, including the game creation and advancement rules, both of which make heavy use of the character sheet.  However, the game-building stuff (Monsters, loot and the necessary stuff for making it all coherent) didn't get done.  <br><br>All in all, it's an interesting 20 pages, and it may bear fruit down the line.  Net result is somewhere between Agon and Final Fantasy, and I admit, that's a tempting enough place to be that I may find my way back there sometime.<br><br>-Rob D.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I was assigned <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/jonathan%20walton.pdf" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Walton's sheet</a>, the game I produced is <a href="http://www.jackaidley.co.uk/AngelsOfTangut.pdf" rel="nofollow">Angels of Tangut</a><br><br>My game was inspired mostly by two things: the picture on the side; which I thought was pretty damn Celestial looking, and the Sky/Earth dichotomy backed up the 'wierd angel' vibe it gave me. The second big thing was the "fearful symmetries" box in the centre which drove my idea of choosing from pairs of opposing notions. I'll admit I was less clear on what to do with the other features; glyth and the Tangut-a-go-go fell into place easily enough but I can't help but feel I didn't reallly use the Sky and Earth diagram to their full potential.<br><br>The lack of any identifying or tracking space on the sheet was a bit of an issue, but ended up, I think, giving a more focused design.<br><br>For the Tangut, I chose to have it be a semi-random source of abilities, and raided sources of Tibetan Proverbs for the key-phrases linked to the different symbols. How well these phrases will work in play I'm not sure, I couldn't decide whether they were too obscure to use or so imprecise they could be used for everything.<br><br/>Ultimately I lacked the time to really finish the game and rushed some key areas; I also didn't have time to work on a custom resolution system and instead simply half-inched the one from <a href="www.chanter.greatorkgods.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Chanter</a>. I don't really know how it will work out in play, having never really got the time to run the numbers but I'm really happy with some of the ideas, especially the notion of Locale and the way in which the outcome of choices effects other locations. The rotating GM and fixed remit of location structure pleases me.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Sheet: <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Joshua%20Bishop%20Roby.pdf" rel="nofollow">Joshua BishopRoby's Cool Sheet</a></p>
<p>Game: <a href="http://www.momentarylapsepress.com/fd/fd.pdf" rel="nofollow">Foe Destroyer</a></p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> I had a hard time coming up with a system that would support the type of play that I was envisioning. I was striving for a very open story telling type of play that could lead anywhere, like I experienced in an online game of Death Stakes, but I wanted to confine play to the relationships between characters. I wanted to wrap this in a futuristic giant robot cartoon style setting. I also wanted the character's to not exactly like each other at the start of play, have that hatred grow, but be redeemable at the end. I also wanted simple. It was very challenging to come up with a system that I thought would work for this. And I'm still not sure that the system will support the redemption enough.</p>
<p>I also had very little time for the contest, because of work load during the busiest weeks of my work season. But everyone else also was very busy I'm sure.</p>
<p><strong>Over Coming The Challenge:</strong> After struggling for a couple of days, I just decided to write a script out about how I envisioned a game of Foe Destroyer would play. I used four players and wrote out character creation, scene setting, conflict resolution, and end game as dialogue between the four imaginary players. This helped me come up with a system that I hope will help somewhat to emulate this style of play.</p>
<p><strong>Joys:</strong> I felt pretty lucky getting the sheet that I received, because it was actually one of the sheets that I was hoping to get. The setting was very easy to come up with. I really enjoyed the challenge of the deadline and working hard to get things finished. Also, the cover of the game came from my brother. Out of the blue he sent me the picture and asked if there was anything that I could use it for, and it worked pretty nicely for this game.</p>
<p>It was a fun contest. Thanks Kevin and Joshua for letting me participate and giving me the character sheet to attempt to build a game from.</p>

                            I, too, had Jonathan Walton's sheet.  Jack and I were the only two people to work off the same sheet, I believe, and the outcome is quite different.<br/>
<br/>
Challenges: The sheet has none of the usual character trappings, so I knew I had to think outside of the box.  The diagrams provided ample opportunity to do that. However, the biggest challenge was the strange tone of the sheet.  While the diagrams had one feel, "Fearful Symmetries" had another, and having "Tangut-a-Go-Go" on the sheet ultimately made it impossible for me to create a serious game.  I wasted at least a week thinking of serious game premises--whether it's people laying spirits to rest or interpreting dogma or fighting back the invading horde of Ghengis Khan or walking between worlds--because they ultimately clashed with the Go-Go.  <br/>
<br/>
Resolution:  In the end, I decided to completely swing the other way and make an over-the-top game where you're supposed to be silly and overacting.  In a way, that actually seems quite worthwhile, because so many of our recent indie games are high on the pressure of coming up with cool, serious stuff.  I used the diagrams as built-in relationship and location maps.<br/>
<br/>
Joy:  I think the game is actually playable.  It's also silly and fun.  Having people interpret the Tangut symbols as a result of play and then each person writing a "moral of the story" thing out of them is one of my favorite parts of this design.  This was a challenge, and it opened my mind to new possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Regrets:  The finalization was rushed once I knew what I wanted to do.  So the way Fearful Symmetries and the Glyph are used are half-baked.  Also, I don't know what Jonathan was expecting, so I hope he's alright with it being a very light-hearted game.<br/>
<br/>
Further Notes:  Next time I'll do it if I don't have so many other things already going on.  Also, I hope that no one is taking the game with its lighthearted, over-the-top soap aspect as in any way a commentary on Chinese culture.  It could just as well be Caucasian Soap and be exactly the same game. :)<br/>

                            So now that I've finally gotten a PDF available in an accessible spot, I feel like I can chime in on this.<br/><br/>I'm mostly looking back in amazement that I got anything at all together for this one; my wife and I were surprised when a house we were looking at mostly out of curiosity turned out to be "the one," and then when our slight lowball of an offer got actually considered and responded to, so the past few weeks have been a blur of free-time-eating paperwork for that.<br/><br/>I was working from <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/GWalmslySheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Graham Walmsley's sheet</a>, and produced <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~djc30/Prosopa_DJC_SGRE06.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which is a lot further along than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Initial reaction:  "Huh?  Wow.  Not a lot to go on there... I feel like I want to add something... more... just to make it have enough information to be a character."  <br/><br/>Second take: It'd take a little interpretation on the part of the player, but there was enough information space there to not only be a character, but a resolution chart.  So, in the end, all I did with the character sheet was to recenter things on the page (graphic design foible), and to add a grayed-out version of the game's "title" to the bottom.<br/><br/>What didn't get done: <br/>I only got halfway through a set of edits, it turns out - the intro bit that defines the basic parts of the game missed some words in Search-and-Replace, basically because "story"=/="stories", so it didn't change all those to "Act", and somehow I left the clunker "Anthology" in.  (I blame sleep deprivation.)<br/>I didn't get custom cards done; while they're not necessary to play, they're a definite play aid, and they'd have been nice to have.  I'm tinkering with them (since I've got time, now), and if anyone reviewing the game (or otherwise) wants 'em, I'll be glad to send them out, as long as the game gets evaluated without them.<br/>I didn't get a sample character w/ interpretation, sample settings, or many examples of play done.  These need to happen, since I think one of the strengths the system has is flexibility, but that's also a potential weakness if it comes across as "vague" instead of "flexible."<br/>I didn't <b>at all</b> get around to layout, really, let alone the layout and final vision I've got for the game.  That'll be coming, though - probably once this has gotten some feedback and some playtesting.<br/><br/>What I loved:<br/>Webdings.  I love the fact that Graham's sheet has no language at all on it, only symbology - while at first that seemed limiting, it ended up inspiring, to the extent that the <b>title</b> is in Webdings.  Which is problematic, since SG's boards don't seem to let me use that as a font here, but fun.<br/>I've got an end goal that stretches that idea even further, but I think I'll leave that unstated for the moment.  It's part of the reason for the flexibility, and the non-setting-specific nature of the game, though.<br/><br/>Tons of fun, and well worth the sleep deprivation.<br/>(edited to fix some odd HTML bug which was making the pre-link part of my post a dead link)<br/><br/>- D.J.                        </div>

<p>Sheet: <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Joe%20McDonald.pdf" rel="nofollow">Joe McDonald</a>'s<br/>
Game: <a href="http://njyar.thesmerf.com/not-guilty.pdf" rel="nofollow">not/guilty</a></p>
<p>Designing this game was a blast.</p>
<p>Generally, my design process (these days) looks like this: I get a game concept, I gather some input (reference and inspiration), and I kinda let it percolate in my head for a few days; then a game text sort of bubbles out. It's all intuition-powered, and, when there's good input, effortless.</p>
<p><strong>The Awesome:</strong><br/>
Joe's sheet has lots of input, good input: it transparently gave me subject matter and inspirational tone-setting images, and the fill-in boxes and questions made it obvious how the heet interacted with play.</p>
<p><strong>The Lame:</strong><br/>
Upon making my layout decision, which involved a lot of information separating and hiding, I had to rewrite the game text under very tight structural constraints, which was challenging and not overly fun. I detest rewriting.</p>
<p><strong>Awesome Again:</strong><br/>
Laying out the game gave me an excuse to dig out some of the gorgeous photos of graffiti I had taken recently in Barcelona, and was in general a good time. I didn't intend the game to become the structural experiment it is now, but I think it's more fun for it.</p>
<p><strong>The Design:</strong> <br/>
My initial thoughts about this game were vague and meandering. I said to myself, "Hm, a mysterious death? Okay..." and made it about a whole <em>investigation.</em> But as I was writing, I kept cutting things away, and each time I did so, the game felt sharper, cleaner. I'm really pleased with how specific it is, and how tightly structured it is. I'd love to see it played; I'm curious about the effect the naming rules have on the way people portray the characters.</p>
