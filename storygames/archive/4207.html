This is a game about N'gola (modern Angola and neighboring regions).<br/>2. It starts as a hack of Malcolm Craig's <i>Cold City</i>, but that's not how it ends.<br/>3. It is inspired by Sight A, Sound A, and Theme A.  "A" + "N'gola" = "Angola."<br/><br/><i>Mwaantaangaand</i> takes place in the years following 1975, when Angola gains its independence from Portugal after years of fighting.  The Angolan struggle for independence from colonial rule has quickly devolved into a civil war, as various factions and political interests compete for control of the young nation.<br/><br/><b>DOMESTIC POLITICAL INTERESTS</b><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Bandeira_do_MPLA.svg/45px-Bandeira_do_MPLA.svg.png"/><br/><b>Movimento Popular de Liberta\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o de Angola (MPLA)</b><br/><br/>The MPLA was a nominally communist movement under Ant\xc3\xb3nio Agostinho Neto (until his death from cancer in 1979) and Jos\xc3\xa9 Eduardo dos Santos (currently the President of Angola), strongly backed by the Soviet Union, Cuba, former Portuguese colony Mozambique, and a large number of other socialist, post-colonial, and Soviet Bloc nations around the world.  Previous to Angolan independence, the MPLA had one of the most illustrious records when it came to resisting Portuguese rule. In 1975, the MPLA declared the establishment of the People's Republic of Angola.  In addition to its domestic opponents, UNITA and the FNLA, the MPLA was most strongly resisted by the United States, South Africa, and China (the latter being strongly anti-Soviet, though also communist).<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Bandeira_da_FNLA.svg/45px-Bandeira_da_FNLA.svg.png"/><br/><b>Frente Nacional de Liberta\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o de Angola (FNLA) </b><br/><br/>The FNLA was one of the older anti-colonial factions in Angola, founded by Holden \xc3\x81lvaro Roberto (about the same time as the MPLA founding) and long involved in the struggle for independence.  After 1975, the FNLA declared the establishment of the Social Democratic Republic of Angola along with UNITA.  During the ensuing conflict with the MPLA, in which the FNLA was one the communists' chief opponents, the organization received substantial support from Algeria, China, Ghana, Israel, France, Romania, South Africa, the United States, and Zaire.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Ao-unita.gif/45px-Ao-unita.gif"/><br/><b>Uni\xc3\xa3o Nacional para a Independ\xc3\xaancia Total de Angola (UNITA)</b><br/><br/>UNITA was a conservative socialist movement led by Jonas Savimbi, who had recieved some training in China and exhibited Maoist ideological tendencies before ultimately leaning more towards American political values. UNITA split from the MPLA &amp; FNLA after Angola's independence and was nearly annihilated by the MPLA.  However, it barely survived and soon began an effective guerilla campaign, resisting MPLA rule with the backing of China, South Africa, and the United States.  UNITA took part in a joint declaration of the Social Democratic Republic of Angola with the FNLA and so was nominally allied with them.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/a/ao%7Dcab63.gif" width="45"/><br/><b>Frente para a Liberta\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o do Enclave de Cabinda (FLEC)</b><br/><br/>Cabinda is a province of Angola that is entirely surrounded by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, seperated from the rest of the country. FLEC was founded by several factions that all sought independence for Cabinda, originally from Portuguese rule but eventually from Angola itself.  Luiz Ranque Franque was the main leader of FLEC after 1975, but the organization fractured into several smaller groups merely a few years after Angola gained independence.  France and Zaire were major supporters of FLEC, though other interests often supported FLEC as a way of harming and distracting the MPLA. In present times, the majority of Angolan hostilities have now ceased, but the Cabinda conflict continues.<br/><br/><b>EXTERNAL POLITICAL INTERESTS</b><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Flag_of_South_Africa_1928-1994.svg/45px-Flag_of_South_Africa_1928-1994.svg.png"/><br/><b>South African Defence Force (SADF)</b><br/><br/>Already involved in asserting white/Western/Christian dominance in the Rhodesian Bush War and Southwest Africa (Namibia), South Africa quickly became involved in Angola to keep itself from being surrounded by newly-independent, majority-ruled (i.e. black) states with communist leanings.  The SADF saw themselves as the only thing keeping communism, Soviet influence, and dangerous black Africans from gaining control of all of Southern Africa.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Flag_of_Cuba.svg/45px-Flag_of_Cuba.svg.png"/><br/><b>Missao Internacionalista de Cubanos en Angola (MICA)</b><br/><br/>Castro sent 30,000 Cuban troops (!!!) to aid the MPLA in asserting control over Angola, despite pleas by the Soviet Union to limit Cuban involvement.  With the US currently tied up in the Vietnam conflict, Cuban leaders thought intervention in Africa would not lead to a direct US response and they were quickly proved correct.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/m/mz_1975.gif" width="45"/> <img alt="image" src="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/m/mz-rnm.gif" width="45"/><br/><b>Frente de Liberta\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o de Mo\xc3\xa7ambique (FRELIMO) &amp; Resist\xc3\xaancia Nacional Mo\xc3\xa7ambicana (RENAMO)</b><br/><br/>Mozambique, another newly liberated Portuguese colony, was experiencing civl war at the same time as Angola, with approximately the same foreign interests arrayed on each side.  FRELIMO was the communist ruling party that eventually triumphed, while RENAMO was the alternative backed by the US and South Africa (increasingly the latter as American interests were diverted elsewhere).  While not major players in the Angolan conflict, both of Mozambique's factions were certainly involved.<br/><br/><b>Front de la Lib\xc3\xa9ration Nationale Congolaise (FNLC), African National Congress (ANC), Zaire, and 1500 Moroccans</b><br/><br/>In 1977, the ANC and FNLC invaded Zaire from eastern Angola, hoping to overthrow President Mobutu. Since Zaire was financing the FNLA and UNITA, the MPLA tacitly allowed the move.  In response, the French government supported Mobutu with 1,500 Moroccan troops and helped Zaire push the invasion (plus a large number of refugees) all the way back into Angola.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94246/#Comment_94246" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T16:03:30+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  4:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, is this a partial script of what is going to be on those 4 pages?

Players are free to play characters from other ethnic groups, but they will clearly be minorities -- which can make for great story material!<br/><br/><b>Bakongo</b><br/><br/>The Kingdom of the Kongo once dominated a vast section of Central Africa.  Its kings, known as Mawaantaangaand ("lords of the earth"), ruled over what is now the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Zaire), and northern Angola.  The ancient capital of the Kongo kings was M'Banza Kongo, lying withing Angola's borders.  Much of the rest of Angola were formerly tributary states under the domination of the great Kongo.  The Bakongo people are the descendants of this former empire, whose kings eventually became Catholic and exchanged letters with the Pope. Their native language is called Kikongo and their numbers are still very large on the other side of the porous northern border, but within N'gola, the Bakongo are relatively few (less than 15% of the population).<br/><br/>The Bakongo make up the majority of the FNLA.<br/><br/><b>Mbudu</b><br/><br/>The Mbundu's language is Kimbundu, though in modern times Mbundu people are more likely to speak Portuguese as a native language, since their area was often dominated by foreign influence.  They make up about 25% of the population of N'gola and once controlled the notable kingdoms of Ndongo, Matamba (near Malanje), and Kasanje.  They also dominate the capitol city of Angola, Luanda.<br/><br/>The Mbundu compose the core of the MPLA.<br/><br/><b>Ovimbundu</b><br/><br/>The Ovimbundu -- who speak Umbundu --  are the largest ethnic group in N'gola, taking up most of the central plains east of Benguela and making up 35-40% of the population.<br/><br/>The Ovimbundu form the main body of UNITA, but other peoples who feel left out of the ethnocentric MPLA and FNLA are often involved as well.  However, UNITA leaders still make appeals to Ovimbundu nationalism at times.<br/><br/><b>THE PREMISE</b> ("Cold City: N'gola")<br/><br/>When the Portuguese came to N'gola, they disturbed everything.  They took many of brothers, sisters, and hated enemies away to far Brazil or sold them to the English as slaves.  We wept for those we loved and rejoiced for those we hated.  They convinced the Great Kings of the Kongo to worship their foreign God and many of the common people as well.  The old traditions were put aside entirely or, more often, drastically changed to reflect this new supernatural power.  And then the violence began.  The land was bathed in blood, so much so that it became cursed and dark with it, with the struggle of our peoples to be free, from the hated Portuguese and also from each other.<br/><br/>But, in the midst of the conflict.  Dark things emerged...\n<ul><li>demonic animals, beasts corrupted by drinking all the spilled blood and listening to the anguished cries of abandoned gods,</li><li>the dead, walking among us and hungering for the life that they no longer have, and</li><li>angry, dangerous spirits, full of fury to punish those that have forgotten them.</li></ul>\nYou are part of a group of individuals, chosen by the ancestors, by your respective organizations, or by God himself to clean out the dangerous supernatural elements that threaten to turn N'gola into more of a hellish nightmare than it already is.  You must work together to cross the warzone, moving among the various bickering factions, sometimes traveling across territorial borders to resolve the evils you uncover.<br/><br/>But can you truly trust your companions?  Perhaps they are more loyal to their own faction than they are to this mission.  Perhaps they are searching for evil creatures or dark magic, not to destroy it, but to use it against those you love or the cause you believe in.  Amidst a nation torn to pieces, how can you hope for cooperation, for unity, for a future?<br/><br/>Well, for now... time to shoot some giant demon spiders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98337/#Comment_98337" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T15:06:42+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  3:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, so I've reworked the game a bit and think I have mechanics that will rock some socks.

The Angolan struggle for independence from colonial rule has quickly devolved into a civil war, as various factions and political interests compete for control of the young nation.<br/><br/>The Angolan Civil War has quickly become a battlefield for the larger forces of the Cold War, as the Soviet Union, United States, Cuba, South Africa, Portugal, China, Nambia, and other African nations supply arms, funds, and troops to various Angolan armies, hoping to guide the eventual outcome.<br/><br/>The South African Defense Force has recently pulled back to their bases in Southwest Africa (Namibia), leaving behind the experimental refuse of dark science.  The top secret workings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Coast" rel="nofollow">Project Coast</a> have unleashed untold horrors in the form of <i>mahamba</i> (sing. <i>lihamba</i>), possessing spirits that bring sickness.  <br/><br/>Normally, <i>mahamba</i> are simply the vengeful spirits of your own ancestors, causing sickness and death unless diagnosed and properly treated by a <i>nganga</i> healer, but these <i>mahamba</i> have been warped and twisted, giving them powers that even the greatest <i>nganga</i> little understand. The makeshift laboratories and unfortunate villages where the Afrikaners tested out the weapons of Project Coast have sunken underground, down into the lands of Kalunga Ngombe, lord of the dead, down to Mpemba, the City of Chalk.<br/><br/>Like the heroes of legend, you and the fellow members of your Ndembo Unit descend into the earth to that land beyond life, hoping to repair the damage your land, hoping to prevent all of Angola from becoming an extension of Mpemba.  You can make this journey because you are ritually dead; you have joined the Ndembo Society.<br/><br/>In the religious traditions of the Kongo region, the <i>ndembo</i> society of a given village oversees the spiritual rebirth of its members.  Those inducted into the society fall down, apparently struck dead by some mysterious power.  The newly dead are given a funeral and their bodies are taken taken into the society's hut, where secret rituals occur over a number of days.  Eventually, new members are resurrected through the power of the society's <i>nganga</i> and leave the hut to return to their lives in a fresh, reborn body.  Society members also share knowledge of the secret language Kizengi.<br/><br/>To combat the evil forces that Project Coast loosed upon their lands, the various warring factions of Angola have agreed to the formation of a national-level, coalition Ndemo Society.  Several members of each of the various armed groups fighting for control of Angola will be placed in mixed units under the oversight of supposedly neutral <i>nganga</i> spiritualists.  They will die in accordance with the rites of <i>ndembo</i> and spend time in a society hut, with the official huts being more like special forces training facilities.<br/><br/>Then, instead of being resurrected to new lives, the dead members of each Ndembo Unit will be tasked with journeying into the sunken pits left behind by Project Coast, walking the cold streets of Mpemba, combating the dark <i>mahamba</i> that dwell there, and hopefully cleansing the land of these dark forces.  Hopefully Kalunga Ngombe and the dead will receive the Ndembo Units as allies, for neither the living or the dead enjoy the presence of a <i>lihamba</i>, but maybe the operatives will be blamed for the acts of Project Coast.  <br/><br/>Who knows what awaits these modern day <i>mwaantaangaand</i>, these lords of the earth, far below in the cold City of Chalk?  <b>You do.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98416/#Comment_98416" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T08:09:55+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  8:09AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just finished the bibliography.
