My voice is one of a handful that's going to be polishing the game and giving it a stronger sense of identity. We're already adding some more story-centric mechanics, and overhauling a lot of the fiddly bits to offer more narrative control for the players. But I'm interested in pitching some more ideas. We've brought this up to more Vampire-friendly forums, but their answers tended more toward, "MOAR OF THE SAME!" or "YOU ARE LITERALLY HITLER!" I figure this is probably the best place to solicit thoughts and input.<br/><br/>So, if there's one thing you could add or change about the game, what would it be? This could be mechanical, setting, or thematic.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390285/#Comment_390285" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T15:27:34+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  3:27PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2012 3:32PM by Graham.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the mechanics.

Specifically, there was a great thematic moment for me that came directly out of blowing a willpower roll, I think, when my character went overboard while feeding and killed the guy. That was a really "pure" moment of Vampire play, for me, and it came out of that mechanical relationship.<br/><br/>The fictional relationship between a character and their sire/childe, and secondarily the relationships between clanmates and what those mean. In our game, we put a lot of that in ourselves - I'd love to see some kind of framework that encourages really getting into those relationships.<br/><br/>Backgrounds. To this day, my favorite part of a WoD character.<br/><br/>What I wasn't into: making skill tests, primarily in combat situations. And I'm pretty acclimated to WW-style mechanics, so I didn't find them particularly difficult or anything, just unnecessarily fiddly for what I'm interested in in that game.<br/><br/>Personally, I would re-prioritize the mechanics with Virtue-Vice-Willpower-Blood Points being the primary reward cycle, then some kind of Kinship mechanics, then Backgrounds, then Attributes. Use skills as binary have-it-or-dont-have it things, and just roll Attribute pools, with (maybe) bonuses for having a relevant Background, Kinship, etc.<br/><br/>That's where I would start!<br/><br/>TL;DR: the one thing I would do is prioritize the "parts" of the character sheet like this: Virtue-Vice-Willpower, then Clan, then Backgrounds, then Attributes, then Skills as simple have-it-or-dont-have-it, with attendent rejiggering of what causes you to roll what dice and whatnot.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/machineiv" title="machineiv"><img alt="machineiv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/machineiv">machineiv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390290/#Comment_390290" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T15:54:52+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  3:54PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you so much NDP!

We've got some resistance because corporate-owned property and all, but I think we can make them more interesting. <br/><br/>Sire/childe/family is going to be a huge part of what I'm advocating. So definitely going to see some more of that. Right on the same page there.<br/><br/>Graham: The very basic mechanics are going to look similar. That's a little beyond our control.

The way vampires work in the world. <br/>- Somehow humanity has to be represented in the rules but I'd like to see it as a more prominent part or have it matter more. <br/>- The Requim approach to sects makes more sense to me, more of them and not as monolithic. <br/>- A city or power structure building mechanic would be something I'd like to see. Where you can build cities or the generations above and below your character in his vampiric bloodline.<br/>- I would like the iconic clans of The Masquerade back. Not the racials stereotypes. Influence from different vampire mythes for the not central european would be a nice touch too.<br/>- Maybe some easy switches to throw in "world creation" to make it more centered about characters personal horror, the city, the clans, the sects or some global endtimes. And degrees from bleak horror to urban fantasy. That will influence the choices somehow. Give the different genres Vampire can do a bit of mechanical identity.<br/>So maybe if you choose personal as your focus you get more choices for NPCs that relate directly to your guy and locations that are tied to his backstory in the character creation. And if you choose to focus on city politics the choices go more into places and people that define the city.<br/>The "magiclevel" could restrict the available clans or powers and also the level of involvement by other supernaturals.<br/>- A mechanic that represents blood and how it gets used by just existing as a vampire<br/>- Some clever idea how to handle the hunt. Make it important but also not take away a whole evening of play every time.<br/>- Vampire clans should have weaknesses I'd say. That is part of the vampirism as curse thing and all.<br/><br/>I would like people who are writing a Vampire rulebook to have read Vampire: The Masquerade in some version. Or even the first and revised edition. To have a feel where it comes from. Damnation City should be on your list of sources as well. Also some of the Masquerade metaplot maybe, Time of Thin Blood or Book of Nod or something like that again for the feel. Also the Requim Clanbooks and Wicked Dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/machineiv" title="machineiv"><img alt="machineiv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/machineiv">machineiv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390293/#Comment_390293" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T16:25:40+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  4:25PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you give me an idea of what you mean by "I would like the iconic clans of The Masquerade back.

This seems a silly thing to say. Maybe it is silly. But one thing that I think is crucial is that across all editions of both Masquerade and Requiem (and I was never one that saw much of a difference except in mechanics between those two), you had the core game that was really good, and never got messed up. Getting too far down into the heart of the game and making tweaks becomes very dangerous when you've got a solid thing you're looking at moving forward with.<br/><br/>If you wanted to do an entirely different Vampire game, that would work too.<br/><br/>Have you looked at Annalise?

But I would also be interested in what that focus, vision and goals are.<br/>I liked the NWOD System better than the old one btw. In combat especially and the rolled 1s taking away sucesses was such a feel bad moment and kind of a trap. So yeah, I guess I want simple combat mechanics and no mechanical traps.<br/><br/>The Malkavian is something that I closely associate with Vampire and Madness a great curse. Some Version of them being back would be welcome. Also the Gangrel and the connection with the animalistic side of vampires. Nosferatu of course should be there too. So clans defined by their curses and the territory they can hunt in. The good lookingbeautiful socialite seducers of Toreador and the immortal nobility of Ventrue are good vampire archetypes as well. That stayed with me since I first read the thin quickstart rules for Revised (a good thing too look at too with it's simplified rules). I think those as a link to past editions and images that became part of popculture should be found within any version of a World of Darkness Vampire game.<br/>But say the Ravnos who are just addicted to some vice and are making illusions because they are magical gypsy charlatans were something I would not really like to see back in the same form. Neither the muslim Assamites who'd like to kill every other Vampire and also are assassins in the crusades era way. I am not expert in vampire mythology but it never seemed like those regional clans were well researched. It also seemed like they were not based on an archetype of vampires in stories but of an archetype of the cultures they were representing. (Or aspects of them)<br/>I'd rather see some interesting vampire myth from around the world get researched and put into the rules. Or make most the clans international or at least give the option to have them be that way. Maybe give examples how they could be seen through a different cultural lense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390313/#Comment_390313" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T21:10:24+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  9:10PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I would really like there to be is more specific advise on how to use the game. Whenever I looked at WoD games, I never was quite sure what to do with all the cool ideas the books were tossing around. There's some good advice, but the lack of procedure made it really hard for me to grok before running a lot of the Apocalypse World based games. I don't mean the GM moves and such, but a list of principles would be good. Maybe some really detailed sample Themes and Moods with some examples of how to implement them in play.<br/><br/>I want a really some kind of way to have players connect with and generate background details that tie into the game. I've noticed a ton of little suggestions about how to do this throughout the nWoD games, but it should be more at the forefront. I'd also like to see more discussion about how to set up scenarios, maybe a big list of seed material for motivations, possibly sorted by clan and covenant.<br/><br/>Really, I'd just like more really solid tools to get some detail in the fiction without pouring over big giant sourcebooks. Have you seen the bits of Apocalypse World that just have a bunch of elements you can mix and match to create opposition? No real mechanics at all, just tools to create fiction easily. <br/><br/>Some discussion about what the design goals for the game are at their core actually are would be good too. Why do you only get the power to be invisible at level three of Obfuscate, rather than at lower levels? Why do Vampires risk frenzy when they first meet? Why is Vinculum in the game? There's lots of stuff that I feel like could use a bit of discussion to really get the most use of it.<br/><br/>Oh, and some official discipline cards would be neat! Just a deck of cards that summarizes the rules for each discipline.<br/><br/>Mechanically, I would like to see some discussion of how to make a truncated stat block. There's a lot of little numbers to worry about right now, and really just know health willpower, and some numbers to base some dice pools on in a pinch would be great. Also, some non-combat uses of some of the disciplines that don't have them would be cool. I'm thinking about Celerity specifically here, it seems like going really fast should let you do way more things than just make you hard to hit, that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Virtues and Vices are neat, but I'd like to see them come up a lot more, and avoid some of the problems like how, say, Sloth seems to imply characters won't do anything. Maybe even something more like the old Nature/Demeanor system as an option could be good. I don't know if there's a sourcebook that talked about this, but I'd like to seem so talk of Disciplines above five. I liked the idea of them being something each vampire got to invent, and mechanical backing for that would be really neat.<br/><br/>Really, I think the base system is pretty solid already. I want tools to use it better, rather than a total overhaul. In looking at it again recently, I've been astounded by how well made the basic mechanics are, and how much easier to grasp than almost any other 'trad' game I've seen.

The stat block thing is one thing that's been in discussions already, and we're retooling the Disciplines for that reason. We're going for a lot more thematic, less number crunchy stuff for the more 'combatty' Disciplines. For example, we're allowing Celerity users to just get up in someone's business unexpectedly.

I liked the idea of them being something each vampire got to invent, and mechanical backing for that would be really neat.</blockquote>\nVirtues and Vices are a little niggling bit we're talking about right now. I agree, Sloth incentivizes boring play. That just plain sucks. We haven't done a sourcebook detailing anything higher than 5. Curiously, a book we just released yesterday published Requiem's first post-five power. I wrote it, it's a sort of "stuff of legends" plot thing. \n<blockquote>Really, I think the base system is pretty solid already. I want tools to use it better, rather than a total overhaul. In looking at it again recently, I've been astounded by how well made the basic mechanics are, and how much easier to grasp than almost any other 'trad' game I've seen. I know this post has been a tad rambly, but I hope it helps. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nAbsolutely helps. We are tweaking, twisting, and refining. But ultimately, the core of the game mechanics will still look similar. Still dice pools. Still ten-sided dice. Still trying to hit 8s. But some of the answers might be different. For example, we're favoring successes being less abstract, nebulous results, in favor of offering options, ala Apocalypse World. <br/><br/>So helpful.

As noted in the other thread, this should definitely include relationships with normal (NPC) humans. And the mechanical elements of relationships ought to be much more prominent than are those from background merits--they should be an often-invoked part of the system.<br/><br/>You've obviously read lots of story games which effectively deal with relationships, and so I'd just hope to see some echo of those innovations--from History and Bonds in *W to the r-maps of games like Smallville--in the new (formulation of the?) game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390322/#Comment_390322" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-15T04:20:26+00:00" title="September 15, 2012  4:20AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Dresden Files City creation for Fate also is worth a look I would say.<br/><br/>For the Virtues and Vices I indeed would have them come into play easier and maybe step away from the seven deadly sins inspired concept into something more open.

The major changes were: no Clans, no Covenants (this is not something I'd want to argue, for most folks this seems to be the center of the game and for me it's the big problem, after 'metaplot' and poorly integrated superpowers); Humanity is not morality.  We've been playing on roll20 a bit now, and I may pitch this after we wrap up the current game.  Anyway, here are the rules for Humanity:<br/><br/><i>Humanity<br/>Humanity does not determine or depend on your moral state.  It is how close you are to losing to the Beast, and limits daytime activity and relating to mortals as per the rules.  Humanity is not lost from doing evil.  It is lost from being vampiric, and gained from meaningful human interaction.  Tests to lose Humanity are made every time a vampire feeds, commits Diablerie, or enters frenzy, and may be called for by the ST when dramatic failures are rolled for Disciplines or other distinctly vampiric activity.  A Humanity test is made on (11-current Humanity) dice.  Modifiers for the test are as follows:<br/>&gt;feeding from animals +2<br/>&gt;feeding from vampires +1<br/>&gt;tried to resist frenzy +2<br/>&gt;tried to ride the wave +1<br/><br/>Loss of Humanity does not trigger tests for Derangements.<br/><br/>A vampire may only spend experience to raise Humanity if they have created, cultivated, and maintained mutually rewarding relationships, free of coercion, with human beings, since their last Humanity loss.  Some friendships and loves form quicker than others, but at least a month of frequent contact to call the relationship established.</i><br/><br/>As you can see, I haven't squared away Virtue/Vice and the morality cycle, which may be subsumed in a different advancement/willpower recovery cycle.  But it pushes down, down, and the only way back is through making human relationships and spending XP  Thus the advancement cycle needs to be carefully considered, and so I didn't want to pull something off the top of my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude" title="Emeraude"><img alt="Emeraude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude">Emeraude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390365/#Comment_390365" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-15T17:14:03+00:00" title="September 15, 2012  5:14PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Been toying with systems a lot in the past year for V20 related reasons - everyone felt like playing again - (half a dozen  iterations for now, we never seem to get one that does everything we want* <i>right</i>) in an attempt to do just that. Latest iteration goes something like this:<br/><br/>- D6 based. Hit on 4-6. Difficulty = number of hits.<br/>- GM Turn/Player turn cycle. You can win more actions in player turn by playing "beast aspects".<br/>- Three dice pools: Vampire, Humanity, Beast. Vampire is constant, and only grows as you humanity degrades. Humanity is an expandable resource you can only refresh by setting scenes with whatever it is that maintains you connection to human society during player turn (whether family, craft, job - one Ventrue player started by putting his company as his link; been fairly interesting); relationships degrade over time as they are used, filling the vampire. You get +1 beast die every time you roll a 1 on vampire. If at any time you roll more success on beast than the other two pools, you frenzy. You can reduce beast by using beast successes (which then means you surrender to its sadistic/sociopathic/deranged, your actions are being colored and changed by this).<br/>- Finally, in case of conflict, victory is negotiated. The winning player gets the upper hand and get to impose the conditions stated before the roll, but has to buy back the hits of the opposing player - either by taking negative statuses (hurt, angered, etc...) or by paying in boons. A player can use his boons to use the resources of another player (for example, buy the right to set a scene with his support cast).<br/><br/><br/>Totally not satisfied yet, but I think we're moving in the right direction. At least I hope so.<br/><br/>*: ie, what we want is a political-focused game on self-alienation and the disintegration of identity - with a bit of super-heroing on the side for steam-blowing purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390367/#Comment_390367" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-15T17:57:53+00:00" title="September 15, 2012  5:57PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You have your work cut out for you. <br/><br/>1) The Fog of Eternity really bugs me for some reason.
