I've done fasting too and not eating. But a couple of times I've done that I had to go to the hospital for passing out and sometimes they kept me for weeks<br/><br/>I want there to be a game incentive for trying to eat every day. If "the new normal" becomes eating every third day, because eating normally resets the clock, then\u2026 uh...<br/>A. that then should be the baseline and like "living expenses" should be calculated around that, and<br/>B. why is there then even a "half a ration counts as half a day of eating" rule...<br/><br/>Day one: eat half a ration. Day two. eat the other half. End result: your starvation clock is at 1.<br/><br/>Day one. Eat nothing. Day two. eat one ration. End result: your starvation clock is at zero.<br/><br/>Sure, on the "eat nothing" day you couldn't lose exhaustion levels. Which can be super relevant.<br/><br/>So what I'm saying is:<br/><br/>1. Either we stick with RAW. And then "the new normal" is to eat every third day (let's say you have +0 con, I get tired of writing 3+0), and also eat (or eat half) on days when you believe that you are going to want to lose exhaustion levels the next night. And RAW has a recursion at this point\u2026 it says to reset it by eating a day of normal eating. And a normal day of eating is now \u2153 ration, because the new normal is to eat every third day. And then the new new normal becomes to eat \u2151 ration, because the new normal is to eat \u2153 ration every third day. And then the new new new normal becomes to eat \xb9\u2044\u2082\u2087 rations, because the new normal is to eat \u2151 ration every third day. And so on.<br/><br/>2a. Try some rule to discourage this slippery slope of increasingly newer normal. The "triple" rule I'm not sold on. Arguably the VotE (where I got it) just spends of spending three times as much <i>money</i> on food, could mean better food. But still not logical.<br/>The "if you give up on an opportunity to eat food, the starvation clock advances 1d3 instead of 1" seems good. Simple, makes constitution really matter, is hard to plan around and game\u2026<br/><br/>2b However, that aforementioned 1d3 rule is very far from the RAW. The triple rule is more justifiable in the raw because it just says "a normal day of eating resets the count" and you can easily argue for different definitions of "a normal day of eating".<br/><br/><br/>Adam, the PCs don't want to lose weight                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475235/#Comment_475235" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-05T19:29:27+00:00" title="July  5, 2018  7:29PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember reading the rules and being troubled about the same thing, with the instant reset if you eat once per three days.<br/><br/>It has never really come up in one of my games (no players noticed the loophole and tried to abuse it), but the houserule I would use would be that after fasting, each day of normal eating reduces the clock by 1 <i>instead</i> of curing exhaustion.<br/><br/>So if you go without food for three days, you then will have to eat normally for three days before you can start using overnight rests to cure exhaustion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475237/#Comment_475237" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-05T20:08:11+00:00" title="July  5, 2018  8:08PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember, if you've racked up exhaustion, eating normally only fixes one level of exhaustion every day.

Here it is:<br/><br/>A character starts "fasting" when they go six hours without food. A "fasting" character gets some exhaustion penalties and heals slower (an exhaustion level in 5th edition terms?), but is otherwise fully functional. You can remain fasting indefinitely (or as long as an adventurer is likely to need to, anyway) as long as you eat half-rations. A character recovers from their fast by eating normally for as many days as they fasted in the first place. For example, a character who is on half-rations for a month will need to eat normally for a month to regain their full vigor and get rid of that exhaustion penalty.<br/><br/>In other words, you can halve your character's food intake at the price of an exhaustion penalty. Full-time if you want.<br/><br/>A character goes from "fasting" to "starving" after a couple of days of hard exercise (marching and fighting, the sorts of things adventurers do) without food. Add the Con bonus, why not, or you might wish to do some sort of Constitution check to see if the starvation starts on a given day. This "starvation clock" only resets when the character's fasting ends, so no gaming anything: you can skip a few days of food during a fast without turning it into starvation, but it all counts until you recover from the fast by eating normally for a while.<br/><br/>During starvation I suggest that characters should just gain exhaustion or take HP injury or whatever every day until they start eating normally. This represents the general break-down of body equilibrium that occurs when you get seriously malnourished; you can't just stop that by going back on half-rations once it begins. Eating normally for days equal to the time they spent starving returns them to "fasting", and eating normally for as long as they've spent "fasting" returns them to a normal sustenance situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475241/#Comment_475241" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-06T05:34:56+00:00" title="July  6, 2018  5:34AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So a lot of people are suggesting that you reset by eating 1 portion per day for as many days as you didn't. That still means that you could skip every other day without penalty. The system I want is one that gives them incentive to never skip, but that hews close to the RAW (since it's in the PHB, not DMG) when you are in a true emergency.<br/><br/><i>Game</i> design wise, the triple works better than the 'if you don't obey you'll get more clock' since it feels more like interesting choices. But as noted, it doesn't align with how people do eat in emergencies. It does give a sense of desperation though.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is I want there to be a real deterrent to skip, but a low punishment/consequence for when you <i>have</i> to skip.<br/><br/>Eero, you die after six exhaustion levels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475242/#Comment_475242" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-06T05:43:19+00:00" title="July  6, 2018  5:43AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, the RAW already makes it pretty pointless to eat half and I want to make eating half more appealing than eating none.<br/><br/>In your system, you can still do the skip trick.

To me it seems that the issue in your system is that a character who eats every other day does not suffer from any exhaustion penalties for their irregularity. In my suggested system a character eating every other day is mildly exhausted 100% of the time. It is true that they are not advancing towards starvation, but hey, that's how human physiology works in rough terms - you can eat less if you don't mind having less energy.<br/><br/>Maybe what you need is a harsher exhaustion penalty, something to make a player sit up and pay attention to it. I don't remember off-hand if an exhaustion level means anything in 5th edition by itself, but you really should be allocating some sort of real penalty for this stuff - a minor circumstance penalty to hit, slower healing, that sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475244/#Comment_475244" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-06T06:28:13+00:00" title="July  6, 2018  6:28AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a very heavy penalty since it opens up the door to a lot of the death spirals in the game.<br/><br/>But you added that penalty to eating half, too, remember?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475245/#Comment_475245" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-06T06:32:15+00:00" title="July  6, 2018  6:32AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, part of the problem here is that you haven't looked at the rule as it is in 5e, leading you to tread over a lot of the same ground.<br/><br/>The penalty is that you can't remove exhaustion levels that you get from other things.

It wouldn't be a big deal if you were just sitting around in a monastery (a place where fasting is common-place), but that minor save on the expenses could become a rather drastic problem if you had to fight or exercise during that time period, which would be impacted by the exhaustion. It would be even worse if something unexpected came up and forced you to forego water or sleep or other necessities, compounding the exhaustion.<br/><br/>If you're comfortable with the trade-off of halving your eating expenses but being exhausted, then I would further suggest just doing a long-term half-rations fast. Easier on the book-keeping, and you can keep that up for weeks at a time no problem. The food-save is the same as eating only every other day, and the length of the exhaustion period is as well: double the time you spend on half-rations.<br/><br/>(It goes without saying that I wouldn't mind a Feat that lessened the consequences of living on a fast regimen. Seems like the sort of thing that an ascetic character would do. They could even get some spell-casting bonuses or something like that for their trouble.)<br/><br/>Now, that's my perspective on it as a GM. What is yours? If a player wanted to eat every other day, and was willing to take what amounts to a permanent exhaustion level in trade, would that trouble you, and why?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475252/#Comment_475252" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-06T14:44:53+00:00" title="July  6, 2018  2:44PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2018 2:46PM by Vivificient.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So a lot of people are suggesting that you reset by eating 1 portion per day for as many days as you didn't.

Under this proposed rule, if you ate only every second day, you would never be able to recover exhaustion levels.<br/><br/>By contrast, in RAW, if you eat every other day, you would recover exhaustion on each of the days when you eat.<br/><br/>My suggestion is a fairly mild deterrent because it only punishes you in the event that you eat less than every day, and then subsequently gain exhaustion (from some other source).  Still, that is enough of a risk (since exhaustion is so deadly) that I think it would act as a mild deterrent to intermittent fasting while adventuring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475453/#Comment_475453" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T20:09:08+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  8:09PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Oh yeah, I promised to answer here.</p><p>Hold on, there are a couple of subtopics here.

Is it just because it can kill a character <i>who is already exhausted</i>? I really, really don't understand why this is a problem, as somebody who is already extremely exhausted totally can die from fasting. That's entirely reasonable as far as I'm concerned, as it gives precisely the effect one should want: you can fast with only minor consequence, but only if everything else is fine with you. Fasting quickly becomes a more serious concern when you add other issues on top of it.<br/><br/>Anybody who's tried fasting in real life has probably encountered this simple dictum: don't fast if you're ill in any way. Fasting for fun is only for healthy people in controlled conditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475471/#Comment_475471" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T21:52:14+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  9:52PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One is harmless and therefore pointless. Two halves your movement. Three halves your fighting&amp;saves. Four halves your life. Five you can't move, six you die.<br/><br/>So either the punishment is nothing (in which case why have a punishment) or it's pushing them down a death spiral that's very hard to break out of.<br/><br/>We've had PC death and TPK often. But when the rules cause them. Not because I just decide it happens. There's a rock-falls-feel to giving out extra exhaustion. Especially for something -- skipping a day of food -- that happens often enough on Earth. Now, skipping a day of water leads to exhaustion right away. That's water. Food is food though.<br/><br/>The RAW <i>already is</i> that you can't lose exhaustion when fasting. So normally you'd lose one per night, fasting takes that away. In other words, it's like it's adding one per day (by cancelling out the one you would subtract normally).<br/><br/>It's already the case that combining fasting with other exhaustion quickly becomes lethal. Fasting without water: 1 level the next morning, 3 the morning after that, on the third morning you can't move and by night time you die. Adding Eero house rule: you die one earlier day. Your movement is halved an earlier day, too. 3 5 dead instead of 1 3 5 dead. And, it's the first and most interesting day that's removed, jumping right into the spiral.<br/><br/>Exhaustion is part of the 5e game play that currently works really well, we've had some scares and tense moments when someone's headed down that road.<br/><br/>Except now we don't need a punishment because the players agreed to not do it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475472/#Comment_475472" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T21:58:47+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  9:58PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RAW: if they fast, and get exhaustion from something else, they die<br/>EHR: if they fast, and get exhaustion from something else, they die one day quicker<br/><br/>Both: if there's no external exhaustion, eating only every fifth day has next to zero consequence<br/><br/>So the EHR doesn't change the problem with the raw, it just feels like a vindictive "I just want the PCs dead sooner" move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
