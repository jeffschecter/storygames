It's terrible, awful, and jerky of me. I think it arises out of an impatience to have something happening all the time in a game. When there's silence or pondering, it tends to drive me nuts. On the other hand, I acknowledge that this is really fucking annoying behavior. It's shitty of me.<br/><br/>When games have things that draw your attention to spotlight sharing (<a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/games.html" rel="nofollow">Primetime Adventures</a>'s spotlight mechanics, <a href="http://www.burningempires.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=30&amp;osCsid=a3cb6a83a1e051bea2231c1e82dc8b28" rel="nofollow">Burning Empires</a>'s scene economy, etc.), that helps me a hell of a lot. If there's something sitting in front of me, reminding me to defer to someone else, I tend to do pretty good.<br/><br/>As for what I'm doing to fix this, it's really fucking hard. I almost need a therapist for it, I think. It's hard to recognize when I'm doing it. I sometimes ask people before a game starts to let me know if I'm doing it. I dunno. I'm kinda stuck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216509/#Comment_216509" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T12:20:11+00:00" title="July  5, 2009 12:20PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ref a lot, so when I play I have a distinct tendency to grab the spotlight and try to drive the game (to mix a metaphor).

My first creative writing course as an undergrad was structured so the class publicly discussed and criticized everyone's writings without knowing which student was the author of what. But when my first story was being discussed, and with some pretty powerful compliments, I couldn't stop giggling. So yeah, it was obvious to everyone who the author was. It was a bizarre, uncontrollable emotional reaction. I actually wrapped my spiral notebook around my head trying to control it, and managed to hold myself to a sort-of mad, squelched giggling.<br/><br/>I dunno. I somehow can't handle intense emotional reactions to authorship. Jokes and non-sequiturs let the intensity out of the situation, sometimes to the great irritation of others. But my unconscious brain must be more scared of my own uncontrollable reactions than the consequences of violating the social contract.<br/><br/>Blech.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216529/#Comment_216529" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T14:23:57+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  2:23PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to try to be less awesome so that other people won't feel bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216542/#Comment_216542" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T17:00:57+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  5:00PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            nemomeme hit mine on the head --"I think I am sometimes too content to just listen when when others are in scenes or the spotlight.

I think one thing to do (I'm guilty of it too at times, although far less than the other things I cited) is just to be aware of other players and their contributions at the table. If it's quiet, and you want to jump in and make things happen, do it, grab the spotlight. Do it for a second, and then think of a way to inspire or cue or include at least one other player at the table. That's how I try to share it. Often, once one person starts doing this, the quiet people pipe up, everyone starts getting everyone else involved instead of even having spotlights be a thing, and then instead of someone being that person who "grabs the spotlight", they're the person who gets things rolling, and brings on the fun.<br/><br/>edit: gah, i have no idea how to fix that quote<br/>edit: mostly fixed, thanks Robert!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216660/#Comment_216660" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T11:27:41+00:00" title="July  6, 2009 11:27AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2009 11:27AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>Do it for a second, and then think of a way to inspire or cue or include at least one other player at the table.</blockquote>\nYeah, one thing that I do is that when I notice I'm doing it, or that a certain person hasn't had the spotlight in a while, I say, "Hey I feel like we haven't seen enough of X.

I tend to choose an archetype/party role that's not been taken by anyone else, even if I have no enthusiasm for it. I just don't feel like fighting for spotlight time so I use a somewhat passive aggressive tactic where my character ends up being a misfit just so I can have my shiny moment another way. I should just grow more balls and try and play competent socially involved characters more often (kind of rejoins Jacob's problem).<br/><br/>I'm also this kind of player who likes to discuss cookies recipes with the town's baker and I know it bores many players out of their mind. I wish instead I could state that I'd like a little more in character conversation from everybody at the table. I have a hard time finding as much satisfaction in a game mechanic deciding the result of a social interaction as in IC interactions.

I'm a combat vet, back from the desert, trying to return to a "normal" lifestyle, and I'm being confronted by a co-worker, an ex-con who's trying to keep to the straight and narrow.  Interestingly enough, we have the same connection -- his wife is my younger sister. This is an action show, and earlier in the episode I had hauled off and taken out a pursuer before jumping into a car the co-worker was driving.  Anyway, in this scene he lays into me about how I can't just go beating people up; that's assault, and I could get arrested for that sort of thing, and he wants no part of that because he's trying to stay clean.  So I need to keep my whacko, war-torn mind as far away from him as possible.  Great stuff.  And for my part?  Gruff, taciturn, "just get in the car."  It seemed right at the time.  After the session this whole speech came to me about how I'm not happy my sister married a jailbird and maybe she'd be better off if he did get sent up the river again and so on.  It would have been a nice hit on his "Can I come clean?  Am I a worthy husband/parent?" issue.  Somehow, I need to make that come to me sooner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amazingrobots" title="amazingrobots"><img alt="amazingrobots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amazingrobots">amazingrobots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217069/#Comment_217069" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T15:53:25+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  3:53PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a GM, I pull my punches way, waaaay too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have trouble delivering lines with a lot of emotion.

Sometimes an idea will leap out of the primal idealands and into my head and <i>pressurize</i> my brain and it will need to escape into the wild NOW.  If you've read Motherless Brooklyn by Jonathan Lethem, when Lionel talks about his Tourette's -- that's how it is for me too.<br/><br/>If someone else has the spotlight or narration rights or whatever, I can usually add "Can I make a suggestion?" or a "How about this?" or some other kind of respectful-of-authority wrapping.  This is the main way I've tried to cope, but I could probably get better at it.<br/><br/>A related bad habit that I really really need to correct: sometimes if I'm really caught up in something, and I'm riffing in my own head about the Danger Patrol Stygians (from GPNW) or the Weasels (from our regular Mouse Guard game) then I can go lonelyfun.  I'll disappear into my own head and completely lose track of the table.  <br/><br/>This is fiction writer damage; I spent a long time developing that exclusive inner focus.

Like, if I describe something, anyone paying attention knows Something's Up, because I never describe anything. I'm trying to use Jared's rule from InSpectrres, and get used to mentioning three things about a scene, but this is an uphill struggle. I also suck at crunchy systems, and here, I think avoidance really is the best technique. I can play in them just fine as long as I'm not the gm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also need to stop every few sessions and say to myself: "Okay, step back. The question isn't whether you're having fun -- though that's important, too. Are the players having fun?" And, I know I tend to focus too much sometimes on one person having less fun and stress over it in ways that just aren't productive. This carries over into larp gming, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt convention games, I have a problem once the fatigue poisons kick in. Will I-Nill I, I doze off. This isn't true of every game, but it's true of the solid, good, games that just don't happen to be jam-packed with total awesome every second, and that's something I'm not sure how to fix. It isn't purely a question of when I decided to go to sleep, as I don't always sleep soundly in hotel rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I'm sometimes too much on a tangent with other players, but I'm not sure how to get on the same page. Some of this is experiential -- e.g., if we're playing a game where the PCs are sports jocks, and the other players have, y'know, actually played sports, voluntarily, for fun, they Get It in a way that I don't. But, some of it is a matter of missing cues, whether verbal or non-verbal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218134/#Comment_218134" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T17:18:18+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  5:18PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still struggling with Reasonable NPC syndrome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218140/#Comment_218140" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T17:50:58+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  5:50PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is Reasonable NPC syndrome?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218150/#Comment_218150" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T19:12:51+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  7:12PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its when you've got a problem making NPCs unreasonable assholes. <br/><br/>Like, I've no problem when there are rational reasons for NPCs to be enemies with the PCs and then shoot them in the head.

I'm the guy with the strongly motivated character who's ready to take the game by the throat and go, go, go. The problem with this is twofold: If the GM has things in mind, I'll balk and refuse to go that direction unless it's what I/my character want. This one is more of a style clash than anything... There's some assholism in trying to force the players into your story, but that doesn't mean that digging my heels in and refusing to the point where the GM is getting frustrated and distressed isn't assholic too. The second problem with this is the one that many others have mentioned: I can run over the contributions of other players. I've made attempts to curb this by deciding, up front, not to be a Star Player for a game. I purposely refuse to take the spotlight so that other players can take the lead. This can backfire by going too far though, because many times, other players want some focus time, but they don't necessarily want to take the lead. It's also less fun for me; I have distinctly less engagement with the story when I'm not going balls-to-the-wall. <br/>\n<br/>\nPiss-poor Prep/Improv ratio: I cannot seem to get this right. If I make a concerted effort to prep, I usually prep a bunch of stuff I end up not using, or I try to hard to use it, and it seems forced. The same is true when I use other people's prep, like when I run D&amp;D modules. I either go completely off the rails, or slavishly follow the text. More commonly, I'm too improvisational. Ask me the name of a just-introduced NPC, and I'm likely to ask YOU their name, or come up with something cliched or boring. Take that, and extrapolate it out to other areas of the game, and you can see why it becomes a problem. What's behind this door? "Uh, I dunno, what's behind the door? Uh, I mean, it's.. just a room. Totally unexceptional." Normally, this would be fine, as I've always been really good at improvising once I get into the swing of things, but lets go into my next problem...<br/>\n<br/>\nI've lost my touch. I don't get complaints, but I feel like I don't play or GM as well as I used to. As a GM, my descriptions are usually flat, sparse and boring. My characterizations are as well. I used to be able to get into the most minor character and make them come alive for their brief moment on screen, and my major NPCs were usually pretty three dimensional by the time we got well into a game. (though a disproportional number of my characters speak with some variation of a British accent...) I could see the action in my mind, and describe it vividly. I could see the possibilities branching out from a particular action and pick the one that seemed the most appropriate, to the point where players were constantly thinking I'd planned for that course of action from the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI connect this last problem both with my lack of regular gaming the last few years, and, oddly, indie/small-press games. I don't blame the games.. I blame the mindset I've gotten into with them. I've become less focused on the fiction, and more focused on the mechanisms of play. I don't really know how I've managed to slip that way.

But it's taken a couple years for me to actually get people together to play.  Mostly it's lack of time, and a partner who has zero interest in RPGs.  If I'm going to spend time in a social lesiure pursuit, I tend to want to include him.  So game nights are boardgame nights, since we share that interest.  Lately however his career takes him away from home or takes over his weekends on a semi-regular basis, so I can intersperse my pining and sighing with gaming.<br/><br/>The first foray has been a couple sessions of IAWA.  There's been some growing pains.  Everyone involved is in their forties and hasn't gamed in years if not decades, so we're rusty.  Also, we all played more traditional, rules-heavy, GM-as-motivator-heavy games back in the day, so we have "bad" habits.  The players are a little too passive, and a little too averse to conflict among each other.  I as the GM have been a little too active, or maybe active in the wrong ways.  Instead of encouraging the players to find the good cross-connections and conflicts, I get unnvered by the inertia and start pushing conflict with the NPCs.<br/><br/>I'm interested in trying some other games like Mouse Guard and SotC, which may work a little better for us since they have a bit more of the GM-as-plot-producer, players-as-team vibe.<br/><br/>A few of us have signed up for a demo of Dread at a local game store in a couple weeks.  It'll be interesting to see how that goes.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What bad gaming habits are you trying to correct in yourself? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9759/what-bad-gaming-habits-are-you-trying-to-correct-in-yourself/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="What bad gaming habits are you trying to correct in yourself? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9759/what-bad-gaming-habits-are-you-trying-to-correct-in-yourself/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: WolfeI've lost my touch.

I don't get complaints, but I feel like I don't play or GM as well as I used to. As a GM, my descriptions are usually flat, sparse and boring. My characterizations are as well. I used to be able to get into the most minor character and make them come alive for their brief moment on screen, and my major NPCs were usually pretty three dimensional by the time we got well into a game. (though a disproportional number of my characters speak with some variation of a British accent...) I could see the action in my mind, and describe it vividly. I could see the possibilities branching out from a particular action and pick the one that seemed the most appropriate, to the point where players were constantly thinking I'd planned for that course of action from the beginning.<br/><br/>I connect this last problem both with my lack of regular gaming the last few years, and, oddly, indie/small-press games. I don't blame the games.. I blame the mindset I've gotten into with them. I've become less focused on the fiction, and more focused on the mechanisms of play. I don't really know how I've managed to slip that way. I don't know how to fix it.</blockquote>\n+1<br/><br/>I'm right there with you, Lance, on the rest of your post but this part jumped out at me as well. I also feel like I'm characterizing less well, describing less well. Some of it I think is an increased focus on the mechanisms of play -- they are, I think, much more intrusive into the whole at-the-table-game-play process than they used to be. Also, the games I'm playing are very, very tightly focused on cranking up the volume on the highlights, the conflicts, squeezing every bit of juice out of the clashing of wills.<br/><br/>I can't think of the last time I took the time to really set up context, putter along with description, encourage the players to converse with each other in-character.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure someone will come along and say "but that's not the game's fault!" And I agree. I would also point out that we said exactly the same thing about combat-heavy RPGs in which not much non-combat took place. It's the same problem, except now instead of "if it's not combat there's no system support," it's "if there's no conflict there's no system support."<br/><br/>There's also the emphasis, sometimes even the requirement, that we improvise around the ongoing creative input around the table. I know I had way, way more interesting set pieces when I had time to work out a sketch in my head of a location and major NPCs.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218255/#Comment_218255" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T09:55:44+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  9:55AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>How can I better, I don't know - I guess, do worse?

Do not fear! I am not, on my honor.

As a role-player of exquisite skill - I once played Ged in an Earthsea campaign believably, so well that Ursula LeGuin finally relented to give me the license - I don't have problems with being boring or two-dimensional. However, I find that more and more often the mechanics of play can be focused on to the detriment of roleplay. This is especially true when playing with indie gamers. Strangely, playing older games has unclogged some of this.<br/><br/>I realize that the above paragraph is a little hard to believe, but, as they say, even a diamond needs a small flaw in order to truly shine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218277/#Comment_218277" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T11:20:55+00:00" title="July 14, 2009 11:20AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really liking the direction this thread is going, and I think the context is now right for me to throw my hat into the ring.<br/><br/>So, I actually fo' realz kind of have the problem Clinton describes.  :-)  I mean, I don't generally do accents, and I don't make the other players cry, but I do tend to have a certain level of mastery of RPGs.  Actually, a lot of what I'm talking about relates to what people are saying about mechanics interfering with the processes of play: this doesn't happen to me.  Mechanics are easy for me, almost trivially so except with the most complex games' tactics.  (What I mean is, even though I will almost understand <i>how</i> mechanics work right away, I won't necessarily have mastery over how to, say, win conflicts, quite so quickly, but still faster than most other gamers.)  So I have no problem switching between thinking about what to do mechanically and thinking from an in-character perspective.  I'm really good at weaving connections between the two*.<br/><br/>I get incredibly frustrated when the other players\u2014including the GM, often\u2014don't grok mechanics as quickly as I do, and stumble with them, and fail to connect them to the fiction.  It's a bad habit I've had all my gaming life, and it's certainly true that one of the major appeals of indie games, to me, is the expectation of sticking to the rules-as-written rather than relying on GM fiat.  But it's "assholic" (I like that word!) because it causes to be impatient and rude and obnoxious.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in the DexCon play report thread, I actually walked from a game last week, and it was all due to player skill differences.  I felt like a total asshole, but I just wasn't enjoying the game at all.  What can/should I do differently?  I mean, GMing helps with this, just like teaching helps me not be impatient with people who are bad at math.  (If you're my classmate, I'm going to get impatient with you if you can't keep up with me; if I'm your teacher, then I'm going to be as patient as I can and work with you till you get it.)  But I don't want to GM all the time.<br/><br/>I should mention, many other games I played at DexCon were excellent, generally when about 50% or more of the people at the table were at similar levels of skills to me.  David Berg and I discussed this briefly during a break from InSpectres, actually.  I referred to having "vision."  He and I both sat down at the table and within a minute or two had really distinctive, funny, genre-appropriate characters ready to go.<br/><br/>It's similarly possible to have "vision" for what to do when framing a scene, or a clear sense of how or in what direction a scene should go.  It's something I almost never lack for, especially when I'm playing, but often when I'm GMing too.  It has to do with the mechanical thing, but it's more than that.  "Imagination" might also be a word for it, and, dare I say it, is one of the reason why sometimes people new to the hobby are actually easier for me to play with than old hats\u2014they are naturally imaginative, and have no preconceived notions about how mechanics work.  But in order to play with them I am usually GMing.<br/><br/>Mind you, inexperienced does not necessarily mean low in the kind of skills I'm talking about.  (See the DexCon thread for discussion about DoubleKing's first time participating in any sort of LARP-like thingy.  Part of the reason that was a successful game is that the other players aside from him were all pretty experienced and "visionary" in the sense that I mean it.  But Erik, his protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, is a pretty naturally-gifted roleplayer in terms of having a good sense of vision and direction.)<br/><br/>I *guess* what I'm talking about in this whole rambly post is a version of "spotlight-stealing," as discussed by Rob and others in this thread, but it's not quite that.  I mean, I'm really not a spotlight-hog, and I'm perfectly happy to just contribute to what the other players are doing.  It's just that all too often I'm the only one with any idea of what to do, mechanically and fictionally.  And yes, I frustrate easily.<br/><br/>Arrrgh.<br/><br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*By the way, for those who are having trouble with this issue, I really recommend being incredibly strict with yourself about the idea of what's called "fiction first."  You can't do *anything* mechanical without justifying it in the fiction first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218278/#Comment_218278" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T11:24:19+00:00" title="July 14, 2009 11:24AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2009 11:25AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can be bad at bridging the social gap between internal vision for my character and expression of them in play.  Sometimes I'll push too hard to show everyone a character they may not be all that interested in.  Other times I'll do the opposite, thinking, "my character wouldn't care or do anything here" and becoming detached.  It's really hard for me to modify my vision for greater compatibility with the play of the moment while play is going on.  I need a break, and when I get one, I've occasionally asked, "Hey, is there some way I could change my guy to get more into this?  I was gonna be comic relief, but that's not the vibe here."  Perhaps I could be more proactive about looking for moments to request breaks for this purpose.<br/><br/>As a GM, I under-prepare.  The result of this is that all my mental power during play is directed toward creating situation rather than coloring it.  Which sucks because I love color.  I initially tried to remedy this by generating a short color list, but I've found that I never remember to look at it while I'm doing my usual situation creation.  So I've tried to do more prep.  It's not that I hate prep or anything, I just find it a particularly easy thing to procrastinate on.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>when I notice I'm doing it, or that a certain person hasn't had the spotlight in a while, I say, "Hey I feel like we haven't seen enough of X. Can we see more of him?"</blockquote>This is the glue that has made a lot of my groups work at cons.  Also, suggestions of ways for the quieter players to contribute.  "Oh crap!  Nice reveal!  I wonder how Ted's character would take that, in light of his last scene?"  This can help Ted if he's having trouble finding material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218376/#Comment_218376" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T00:12:00+00:00" title="July 15, 2009 12:12AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I kind of experienced my frustration just today/tonight at D&amp;D4E.

I was thinking about it afterwards, and I was able to put my finger on the problem in a new way, specifically the problem where I have mechanical mastery and many of the other players do not: it feels as though I'm being robbed of spotlight time, or really any chances to do anything, especially in a go-round-the-table-and-take-your-turn type game.  If I have to wait 15 minutes for my turn, AND my turn takes 1/3 of the time of the other guys'... well, you can see how that would be problematic.<br/><br/>I'm still looking at it as a bad habit of mine, though.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218387/#Comment_218387" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T03:35:12+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  3:35AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've lost confidence in any kind of gaming ability I had.

Sounds like a few of us need to get together and find out who really is the best!<br/><br/>Anyway, it is really hard to not be the jerk when everyone else is happily playing their hobbits doing hobbity things and you (read: me) are the one playing Bilbo. After years of theater, it is impossible to dial it down a notch or five. Playing to the back row comes naturally, but the other players rarely take it that way. It is even more frustrating when the GM ignores everything about the character in favor of a generic, flavorless version thereof. Sitting in the corner, doing nothing, is just as bad.

I'm not quite sure how to bring other players to the same level, but that's the right answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm a decent Regency-style dancer, after many years, but one problem I have is the dance version of the reverse of Clinton's problem. When I get a lackluster partner, which is entirely likely at an sf con, I dumb down my dancing. This is completely the wrong thing to do, and I know it. And, it's not the guy's fault -- whoever this guy is, he is someone who is taking a deep breath and going to a dance, risking looking like an idiot, and knowing darn well he isn't likely to pick up someone. He's taking a big risk for a small reward, the reward of being in the dance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I need to do -- what the correct thing to do in an rpg -- is to find a way to make the other guy awesome. I'm not good enough to do that yet. I know guys who are. Years ago, when I was a lot less good at the waltz, one guy danced with me, and the whole time I was dancing with him, I didn't misstep and I felt great. He made me look good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how do folks do this in an rpg? How do you make people who aren't the strongest role players out there, but who are taking a deep breath and wading in, improve in play and feel good about the whole experience?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, I've heard one tactic that works a lot of the time -- turning to someone else and saying, "So, what does your PC think of this?" / turning to the table and saying, "I think we need a scene with X person now."<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other tactics?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stigg" title="Stigg"><img alt="Stigg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stigg">Stigg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218925/#Comment_218925" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T06:44:17+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  6:44AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a GM, I try to be the Captain of the Story too much.  Makes the control freak in me giggle with glee, but disappoints characters a lot and leads to railroading. Both of which I hate as a player.<br/><br/>I'm curbing that by shutting up a lot more.  I have a couple of groups that I play with and one of them I had despaired of ever doing a story game with.  But, I began running Cat and found that they really leaped to the fore when I just shut up and threw obstacles at them from time to time.  And, as usual, it was their ideas that fed into the obstacle creation.  I guess for me it is following outline instead of plot that solves problem 1.<br/><br/>Problem 2: I am also on the spotlight train.  I find that when I'm gaming with a new group or a new system, I try to drive the game along - like I'm doing the GM a favor.  But, let's face it, it's fun to have your own adventure show with a group of Scoobies supporting you!  <br/><br/>I'm using the 'shutting up' tactic for this one as well.  One way to quell the freak is to make it shut up and watch.  Also, recognizing that this is partially a trust issue, I have decided to trust my fellow gamers and the GM more and more.  Having quality players and GMs has helped this IMMENSELY!     Finally, I keep repeating to myself that this is an ensemble effort.   And it is.  Good games come from everyone at the table.
