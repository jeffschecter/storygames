The woman may be interested or disinterested but in any event her interest is assumed to be less than the man's. Since women are assumed to be irrational creatures, the man must bribe and (tastefully) seduce his way through this formal process of flowers, poetry and the many other un-manly things which women are interested in. Eventually he wins her over, that is, he replaces her lack of interest with assent to his desire (women have no legitimate desires themselves so what she wants is never of any actual interest in the process).<br/><br/>In dating or modern day relationship-building, you're right, it's much more egalitarian and both parties can develop or lose interest.  I don't really see that as courting, though. Courting, to me, is a much more patriarchal activity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245442/#Comment_245442" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T23:03:44+00:00" title="December  6, 2009 11:03PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Houses of the Blooded, there are rules for romancing.<br/>The stakes are whether or not the romance "takes".<br/>Out of your die pool, you put aside some dice as a wager, and roll the rest.<br/>The person you are romancing has to match your wager, and both of you need to succeed (get over 10) in order for the romance to keep going.<br/><br/>The higher the wager, the stronger the romance, which is translated mechanically by taking a Level X Aspect, where X is the wager.<br/><br/>There's this fun game of setting aside big wagers to trigger a big romance, but wanting to make sure your partner can "keep up".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245456/#Comment_245456" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T01:10:08+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  1:10AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Diaspora.<br/><br/>For social conflicts, you draw some weird abstract map and then move people's opinions around on it.

Either it becomes interest, in which case now we have a relationship that can be strained or blossom and bear fruit, or it becomes hate, in which case now we have a relationship that has some tension in it, but so long as it stays "polite disinterest", there really is not much happening there. This is why love at first sight is such a common dramatic premise.  ("Skip over the "meh" part of a relationship and get to the crashing waves and swelling violins!")  This is particularly true if the woo-ed is supposed to be portrayed as having any kind of agency at all (which courting, as I note, more or less implies they don't.)<br/><br/>To put it another way, let's go with your idea that the idea of courting isn't inherently dysfunctional in this case. The suitor is presenting gifts and art and walks around the park because they feel the person sought is interested in them, and it's not deceptive because the suitor's gifts/art/offerings are genuinely appealing to the suitor as well.  The problem is that once the sought begins to reciprocate the interest, you have to face the possibility that they are going to express something or present something that makes the suitor go "ugh, um, really?" and call the whole thing off. The only way a courtship goes all the way through to a happy, functional relationship is if both parties develop shared interest in each other and that can't happen so long as it's one person making the moves and the other receiving them.  In other words, you have to stop courting and start doing something more mutual to get to a mutually pleasant ending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245551/#Comment_245551" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T11:57:23+00:00" title="December  7, 2009 11:57AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But in this kind of courting, isn't the female supposed to at least feign disinterest to strengthen her position?

Mutual attraction would mean you've reached the successful end. When s/he spurns you, you've reached the unsuccessful end. What about the attempt to gain the other's interest? On the predatory end, seduction; on the more innocent end, courtship. No relationship ever begins with equal, mutual interest, and "love at first sight" doesn't happen all that often outside of movies. In fiction, lots of stories focus on that first approach--think of <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>, or really any tale of unrequited love. You don't have a functional relationship until it reaches that mutual state, but getting to that place has inspired a lot of fiction. It also seems like something that could translate into some very fun gaming, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245831/#Comment_245831" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T15:28:46+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  3:28PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a game of Poison'd I played recently, one of the deck hands tried to court a girl with poetry, hand holding and gentleness.
