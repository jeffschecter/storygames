Sorry, that op was written from my iPhone just while lying in bed as I was thinking over the situation. So a bit brief.<br/><br/>So.. We had been playing exalted a lot (god kings powers) and a fate version of eclipse phase (post-human super spies) and wanted to do some more old school dungeon crawly type (can we survive this, do good, etc)  games...<br/><br/>I'm using a modified storyteller (d10, stat+skill dice pool) system. Our goal was to have simple characters who were not overly competent facing the world. (west march style if that means anything)<br/><br/>Character: <br/>   the priest - young firebrand in a big church, almost a Joan of arc figure, who sees visions. Either a living saint or demon worshipped depending on who you ask... The player had been a warrior-king and a bitter journalist I last games (super powerful superman, then conspiracy nut cynic in the next game) he wanted to be a believer and' smite evil' palladin type this time.<br/>  The knight: a young unproven knight, naive in the ways of the world, but a trained warrior and proud of her training. The player wanted to have someone physically competent, but have issues around actually dealing with the world. Her problems stem from pride and perhaps doing the right thing in the wrong way. Yes it's a female knight, but none of us are interested in making sexism an issue in the game, so the world is gender blind, but role-heavy - she will be expected to always comport herself as a Knight. Last game she was a macgyver type character, unphased and competent, now she wants to be the newbie learner.<br/>  The merc: a bitter veteran of many wars, he is getting old and decrepit (picture clint eastwood in 'the line of fire' or a similar past his prime type character) who is a mentor/trainer to the knight. He is searching for other ways to become powerful - stealing artefacts, taking powers from demons or what have you. The player wanted to be the practical one this time. He wanted 'take their stuff' to be more than just loot, but to be exploring the occult<br/>  The gypsy child: is the weird one, exposed to strangeness but always held back by the family. He has run away with the others to see the world and explore all the strangeness. The player wanted to make a character that would grab every plot hook, and generally get them all 'into trouble' Last game he was the uber swordsman/god of war who protected the party from any and all dangers, this time he wanted to need to be protected by others from his own curiosity.<br/><br/>The basics of the world is 'generic medieval European fantasy land ' with strangeness lurking in the corners. Image Arthurian England: knights and feudalism, with faery powers and magic wizards and superstiitions that exist for good reason. The priest does really commune with a higher power which can help, the gypsy child can see gates to the Otherworld of fae and walk its paths.<br/><br/>The setup was the knit leaving to bring presents to her married sister,and seek service with the lord-husband who's lands lie in the wilderness The mercenary has been hired to protect the knight, the priest being sent away to bring the faith to the simple peasants. The gypsy boy knows the knight and merc, and is running away to see the world.<br/><br/>The world and situation was built after the characters. We all sat down together and worked out the king of game we wanted, and we built to idea of the world around the characters. The world is pockets of safety it he towns, surrounded by dangers and strangeness. Some things can be fought, other things need to be run away from for a while.<br/><br/>They get to the lands and villas of the sister and find things upset - the villagers are scared, there is a strange pagan god (forest queen) who has appeared and taken the soul of the lord's child. While he's off fighting the evil, his knight has risen up, cast out the lady, and hired thugs, declaring himself the master of the land..<br/><br/>So 2 problems - save the knight's sister/niece/brother in law. And stop the evil knight.<br/><br/>the PCs marched into the forest, and here the troubles started. The gypsy player wanted to roll for 'taking the path to the Otherworld' which to me was something not on his sheet, but he rolled a success. S I narrated that he saw the hoof prints of when the lord rode off to confront the forest queen. They seemed to ignore the warning of the gate-guard being annoyed by 'yet more armed strangers marching into the night' and walked head first into an ambush by the hired thugs from the evil knight. They came to an impasse as the thugs were incompetent, but held the high ground and no one had bows. They fell to taunting each other (the thugs pissing-on the superstition beliefs about a forest queen, while the merc harraunged them about piss-poor planning of the ambush)<br/><br/>That was a bad scene as they started having silences where everyone stared at the character sheets. The priest and gypsy didn't want to fight as they had few fighty skills, and the merc and knight didn't want to start a fight where the enemy had the upper ground. (I saw it as a few incompetent mooks to let the players try out some fighting rolls without too much danger)<br/><br/>The gypsy (with his direction sense) led the others into the forest and back around the hill to try to ambush the soldiers, but he really flubbed the rolls. I wanted then to give them some payback for arning the thugs about the forest queen, and since the players were seeing everything as a massive threat, I decided show them the big bad doing her stuff. The see a glowing light coming through the trees and feel a wave of fear/awe and I make them roll to run in fear, all succeed in the roll, and stand to see a going figure walking through thee trees. I expected them to set up an ambush, or hide, but they started jostling to be the one in front to meet this threat. <br/><br/>So they meet the forest queen (I was trying to describe something like the forest spirit from princess mononoke, a primeval god essentially.) which had entranced the thugs and was taking them back to her 'lair'. The priest got in front and started chanting and trying to exorcise the 'demon'  which had no effect (it's not a possessing spirit to be cast out...) and the forest queen takes little interest in things that can't hurt her - the rest of the group is bowing and scraping and hoping to be not seen. The PLAYER of the priest is now berating the others "great backup guys, best adventuring party ever" while the PLAYER of the gypsy is saying how boned the group is after mr stupid pissed off the spirit.<br/><br/> Backed out of the game here to try to discuss what was going wrong. These guys have been RP'ing together for years now and this is pretty much the first time we've had players on the verge of insults, looking silently at sheets and acting stumped <br/><br/>The players then talked about maybe changing the characters a bit, maybe the priest toning down the zealotry, the glossy moving skills around to be more competent in battle, etc. basically we all felt that something had gone wrong, and we're trying to work out a way to fix it.<br/><br/>Then we called it a night and went for a few beers...<br/><br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure what went wrong, but I suspect that the players were expecting different things from the game, and none of us had the same mental image of the world so the challenges were mis-judged...<br/><br/>Again - help? What needs to be done?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358593/#Comment_358593" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T21:48:35+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  9:48PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2012 9:51PM by Dionysus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>The gypsy wanted to trade for the child's soul, while the priest basically tried to cast out the evil god...</blockquote>\nCan you provide more details?

I like character centric stories where the "story" is about what the characters do. The players will be drivers - ie, I will put them in situation that come from their backgrounds. The priest player wanted 'innocents to protect, evil deeds needing to be righted' so I game them evil knights and innocent children in peril. The knight player wanted 'family honour and glorious deeds' so I gave them relatives in danger and chance to save people. Etc<br/><br/>Basically I like to set up a situation, and see how the characters deal with it.<br/><br/>Tis game was supposed to have character death on the table. We've played in the last games where the characters had become practically untouchable - nothing was a threat anymore - literally we stopped the exalted game as the party of exalts had progressed to the point where nothing was a threat, nothing was able to challenge their position, and the characters had basically achieved everything they cared about, and the game looked like it would become an exercise in "look how cool I can be" that none of us were interested in playing through.<br/><br/>I wanted a game where there were some things that just had to be avoided, or where the obvious path was too dangerous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358596/#Comment_358596" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T22:46:53+00:00" title="February  9, 2012 10:46PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2012 10:51PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This...<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>Basically I like to set up a situation, and see how the characters deal with it.</blockquote>\n...seems to be at odds with\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>I wanted a game where there were some things that just had to be avoided, or where the obvious path was too dangerous.</blockquote>and<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>I wanted then to give them some payback for arning the thugs about the forest queen, and since the players were seeing everything as a massive threat, I decided show them the big bad doing her stuff.

No actual game, just working out what the game is going to be.<br/><br/>The players obviously are trying to pull the game in different directions, but so are you: from the example you gave, when they tried to be proactive and deal with situations in ways that pushed the game towards what they thought would work, you took some steps to block them (your powers have no effect, you need to pass all these skill checks, the NPCs try to stop you, etc.).  The only message that sends is, "I don't care how you want to deal with this situation, because the only way you will succeed is if you deal with it the way I expect you to."  When I've done that to players in the past, it hasn't worked out so great for any of us.  They feel (correctly) that they are not playing the game they want to play, and I feel (also correctly) that I am doing a bad job of steering the game in the best/most interesting/most fun direction.<br/><br/>So that's my advice in a nutshell: don't play the game again until you've all talked this through and figured out what the PCs do in this game, and how they fit into the setting.  I'm sure there's common ground between all of you where you can all have fun.  Our gaming group has gone through this before and will inevitably go through it again, and taking a session off to establish that common ground has always paid off for us.  I think it will for you, too.<br/><br/><br/>As far as unasked-for advice goes, personally, I like to have the first big event in a game be something that's well matched to the PCs' abilities, something that they could absolutely face head on if they chose to, because I'd rather that the first bit of feedback they get about how the game's going to work be positive (you can solve this and prevail) rather than negative (you are an insignificant speck who sucks at your job), even if the only idea they can come up with is brute force.  I save the big guns, the things they absolutely cannot face head on, for later on.  That way, when they try and fail against the Big Bad, it might be seen as a challenge -- we can find another way! -- and not as some kind of power trip to keep them down.<br/><br/>I also try very hard to not form (or at least not get attached to) preconceived notions about how the PCs could solve a problem.  If I'm doing it right, then I'll be listening to their plan and thinking about how that COULD work, not why it WON'T work.  It's pretty rare that the people I play with come up with a completely terrible plan for anything, so I'm okay with just setting up the situation and letting them tell me what the solution to it is.  Even if I'm using a situation where there is one critical action needed to succeed (put the gem back in the idol's mouth, save the princess), I try to avoid creating one critical path that must be followed to perform that action.  (ie, I don't care HOW they get the gem back in the idol's mouth, they can come up with whatever scheme they want and if it's at all plausible I'm willing to let it work, even if it's not what I would have done.)<br/><br/>I do think about potential failure, though, so that I can try and come up with something interesting and not utterly terrible to present to them if their genius plan is executed poorly or just wasn't genius enough.  But again, if my goal is to have the players drive the story, I do my best to not get attached to any of those ideas; they are raw material that I can draw upon to respond to what the players gave me, not things I need to force the players into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358597/#Comment_358597" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T23:19:34+00:00" title="February  9, 2012 11:19PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2012 11:27PM by Dionysus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Payback is wrong word...

I also like making the first encounter an easy one. The thugs were meant to be an easy thing to take on, safely charge in and kick ass. But perhaps because of the way I described the environment or something they perceived a bigger threat. They decided to back away and find a way around (after a significant player discussion on how to avoid coming at them head on, and talking about the thugs as a possible TPK encounter...<br/><br/>Btut I think you are right - i'm wanting to see hoe they deal with things , yet all of us expressed interest in a game where character death was a real threat...<br/><br/>I seem to be having difficulty working out how to do both. <br/><br/>We definitely have to sit down and hash out and align expectations of the game progress and the setting...

Are you OK with TPK?"<br/><br/>The sort of game you seem to be aiming for often <i>does</i> feature a relatively high character mortality, and if the players have bought into it a TPK doesn't have to be a terrible downer. "Damn, we really messed that one up, didn't we?"<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you want to tune mortality rate down, just take a page from Fate make defeat in combat mean whatever seems most interesting instead of death. (Stripped of valuables and left for dead, captured, etc.)<br/><br/>Also:<br/><br/>If the players have trouble picking up your hints of how dangerous something is, make it explicit. "You know about local gods like this. They're insanely powerful." You know: instead of trying to evoke a mood by describing a dark and brooding forest in detail, tell them that the forest is scary -- and then fill in the details. Subtlety is all well and good, but clear communications trump it 9 times out of 10.<br/><br/>If a character tries a tactic that isn't going to work because of ... stuff, and you think their character should know it -- tell them.<br/><br/>"Um, the chasm is 100 yards wide and a mile deep. When you say you jump it, do you mean jump across, or jump into it? Because you know, you can't jump 100 yards, and if you jump into it you'll die. You know this for a fact."<br/><br/>"You start the exorcism, and then realize that it isn't possesed. It's a damn god. You can't exorcise it. You might be able to banish it, if you knew how to banish things."<br/><br/>You need to be damned careful with this, though. As said earlier: listen and consider why it <i>could</i> work, instead of automatically thinking about why it won't. Also do your best to phrase it either as "are you really sure, 'cos there are consequences" or as a failure -- not "you can't even attempt it".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358605/#Comment_358605" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T01:44:32+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  1:44AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like the payers felt blocked, for which the remedy is 'yes and...'  or "yes but"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358619/#Comment_358619" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T04:09:13+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  4:09AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>Payback is wrong word...

The GM would say upfront "Look, this creature gets to roll 13 dice against you if you do that, meaning you have roughly a 2.7% chance of not dying."  We trusted the players to keep that separate from the character knowledge, and it solved a ton of miscommunication errors.  <br/><br/>This leads to the "so what do we do instead?"  And that is, admittedly, the point of giving a monster so many freaking dice.  Get them thinking about less obvious weakness.<br/><br/>Just my two cents.

Either a living saint or demon worshipped depending on who you ask... The player had been a warrior-king and a bitter journalist I last games (super powerful superman, then conspiracy nut cynic in the next game) he wanted to be a believer and' smite evil' palladin type this time.<br/>The knight: a young unproven knight, naive in the ways of the world, but a trained warrior and proud of her training. The player wanted to have someone physically competent, but have issues around actually dealing with the world. Her problems stem from pride and perhaps doing the right thing in the wrong way. Yes it's a female knight, but none of us are interested in making sexism an issue in the game, so the world is gender blind, but role-heavy - she will be expected to always comport herself as a Knight. Last game she was a macgyver type character, unphased and competent, now she wants to be the newbie learner.<br/>The merc: a bitter veteran of many wars, he is getting old and decrepit (picture clint eastwood in 'the line of fire' or a similar past his prime type character) who is a mentor/trainer to the knight. He is searching for other ways to become powerful - stealing artefacts, taking powers from demons or what have you. The player wanted to be the practical one this time. He wanted 'take their stuff' to be more than just loot, but to be exploring the occult<br/>The gypsy child: is the weird one, exposed to strangeness but always held back by the family. He has run away with the others to see the world and explore all the strangeness. The player wanted to make a character that would grab every plot hook, and generally get them all 'into trouble' Last game he was the uber swordsman/god of war who protected the party from any and all dangers, this time he wanted to need to be protected by others from his own curiosity.<br/></blockquote>\nThis level of detail given to characters is a big flag that the players do not want high lethality in the campaign. They put time into these characters and don't want them to die.<br/><br/>A West March-style game is a deadly sandbox. You're supposed* to be a neutral arbiter, and not telling a story. It's fine to foreshadow and warn players, but if they tread into danger and die, so be it. They won't make that mistake again.<br/><br/>I had to reboot my Hinterlands sandbox. After a few adventures and several near-TPK situations, I understood that the players weren't interested in a true sandbox. They wanted to be bad-asses and explore the world and do some role-playing and character development. So I told them to make 3rd level characters and we restarted, and I changed how I was running it.<br/><br/><br/>* If you want it to be a West March game, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
