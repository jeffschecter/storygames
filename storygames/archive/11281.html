I remember one of my friends commenting that the situation on the board I'd created was pretty static; he noted that on the standard board, there are clusters of adjacent SCs that belong to or are threatened by different countries, but I'd made a map where each kingdom had a pretty clear core of SCs and then a frontier. I mean, we had fun anyway, but it was an amateurish design.<br/><br/>Still, I can see on the Three Kingdoms map having riverine units whose main purpose would be to enable and prevent crossings, either by making sections of the river <i>very narrow</i> water squares that had to be convoyed across, or by treating riparian provinces as having "banks" that armies had to declare themselves as being upon one or the other but navies didn't--but navies could only enter other riparian provinces.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250581/#Comment_250581" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T01:54:47+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  1:54AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a South American variant that deals with rivers as simply coasts for inland provinces - that is, there is no river province, just a coastal province that doesn't happen to have a sea area next to the coast, but rather another inland territory.

I solved the fleet problem by adding navigable river spaces, as Mike B suggests.<br/><br/>To me, one of the most compelling elements of the Three Kingdoms setting (especially the "Romance of" variety) are all the awesome personalities, like Guan Yu and Zhuge Liang.  One edge that A Game of Thrones has over classic Diplomacy is an existing mechanism to include officer characters in the game play, in the form of House cards.  Though I suppose one could add in officer rules to Diplomacy without making a complete train wreck of the rules.<br/><br/>I haven't tried out my AGoT mod yet, but if anyone is interested in what I have done with so far, send me a whisper. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250676/#Comment_250676" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T14:42:13+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  2:42PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you have three options with river spaces.<br/>1) a single passthrough-space, like Constantinople in regular dip.<br/>2) Two "coast" spaces that share a border, either one of which can hold a fleet.

That might be useful if there are two few participants in a historical conflict, as you could have extra venues of conflict in the form of some sort of abstractized internal politics of a given Power. I don't know of the ancient Chinese kingdoms here have good color in this regard, but you could maybe have two sorts of units in the game: armies and courtiers (or religious leaders or whatever), the latter of which can move on the semi-detached (because obviously politically important map locations would connect to this board) court board to do battle. The court geography could be largely abstract, representing the historical societal structure; for example, maybe the capital region of a kingdom is neighbored on the court board by an important temple, because the legitimate rule of the capital in question is partially predicated on the support of that temple. Stuff like that.<br/><br/>A specific advantage in relation to what Ben mentioned is that if you're going to model the court politics a bit, then it becomes easier to introduce more Powers into the game in the form of internal political parties of the empires. Internal, or even international: it could get sort of quirky if you had some separate Power with strong courtier potential in several separate kingdoms but little in the way of armies on the geographical map, stuff like that. I could see using something like that in a medieval Europe variant, at least.<br/><br/>I have no idea yet if this particular interpretation (military and societal power on the same board) is really feasible in Diplomacy; the game often becomes unsatisfactory if you try to push it too much, as the obvious demands of the strict rules-set make war on the pleasures of scenario emulation. It's a difficult balance to strike, which is why Diplomacy often only feels "right" when couched into the frame of early 20th century power politics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250686/#Comment_250686" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T16:00:41+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  4:00PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero: That's interesting, but not particularly appropriate to three kingdoms: by the three kingdoms period, the court was totally controlled be Wei, and would continue to be so for the duration, basically. Perhaps Warring States.<br/><br/>The big historical emulation problem with Diplomacy and pre-telegraph wars is that Diplomacy has perfect board awareness. Pre telegraph, this was simply impossible, and "Fog of War" made up a big part of strategic thought.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie" title="RoninZombie"><img alt="RoninZombie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie">RoninZombie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250752/#Comment_250752" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T06:41:17+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  6:41AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>You'd also have to consider your "powers." Only having Wei, Shu and Wu leaves a lot to be desired on the diplomacy front. You could include Nanchao and the Yellow Turbans, which is slightly ahistorical (but no moreso than Turkey as a major power in WWI) and would give you a nice even five. There's probably also a northern barbarian group that you could use.</blockquote>\nIf you start the game in the early years of the conflict, you have more choices available for powers.
