That system is definitely deprecated, it was way too much for me to try to keep in my head.</small><br/><br/>Here's what I'm doing now:<br/>Write every character's name on a <i>portrait</i> index card. Not landscape.<br/>Also put in other stuff on there about them that you care about. I just have their passive perception right now but there's room for more. Keep these cards behind your screen.<br/><br/>Put enemies and other combatants on their own cards (index cards or just use playing cards or paper scraps). You can track HP on them if you want \u2014 I don't because I have another method for tracking HP + I personally want the HP to be public info and the initiative to not be).<br/><br/>Then, dear DM, <b>just fucking freestyle it as if were Dungeon World</b>. That's right, you can fiat it as you want. Now to the trick:<br/>People and monsters who have used their "main action", turn their cards sideways as if it was like tapping lands in Magic the Gathering. Turn your questions to the people who haven't acted, and once everyone has, "untap" it all. I keep this behind the screen, one of the few things I have back there.<br/><br/>This freestyling is awesome, I can ask two people "As the two of you see the wasps stinging your employers, do you do anything?" and whoever speaks first can act first. It... actually worked!?! For once!!!<br/><br/>Weave it into the narration, never say "it's your turn", restate the situation and ask them what they do.<br/><br/>If-and-only-if there is actual bullshit at the table where two people (could be two players, could be a player and DM) actually argue about who's fastest, a la "we both reached for the gun", have them roll off dex to see who grabs that gun first. Weave that into the narration too. But only if neither of them is "tapped", if one of them is tapped then bam you have your answer right there.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b>\n<p>I\u2019m still using this but with a tweak:</p><p>I start out by announcing the monster\u2019s actions! Like \u201cOK, five goblins head toward [NPC friend], what do you do, [PC name?]\u201d and then they can intercept, create a melee group with some of the goblins so that if they want to get to PC name they have to take OA etc etc. Introduces way more <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20652/spatial-relationships-in-verbal-games/p1" rel="nofollow">predicate space</a> and choice in our game play. Now that I have cards it\u2019s even easier to keep track of melee groups.</p><p>So a nice timing is now\u2026</p><ol><li>Decide whether there can be surprise (was either side stealthy?)</li><li>Announce some number monster actions.</li><li>Turn to one or two PCs and ask what they do. Their actions here can intercept the announced monster actions.</li><li>Then do monster action \u2013 they don\u2019t have to obey what the originally announced</li><li>PCs that haven\u2019t acted? Ask one or two of them what they do.</li></ol><p>etc etc keep on using monster actions reactively or proactively as you wish. The action econ truly becomes an econ. Each monster and PC has one main action and then once everyone is out, you untap it all and keep going. There\u2019s no \u201cNew Round\u201d announcement so keep running tab of timers like a 10-count for 1-minute-spells etc tied to that person not to the \u201cround\u201d, there\u2019s not really \u201crounds\u201d everyone is just untapped immediately as the last PC or monster is tapped.</p><p>PS the <strong>rule</strong> isn\u2019t changed, this is just a way of applying that rule that I have found is good and agential.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472854/#Comment_472854" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-25T05:17:23+00:00" title="April 25, 2018  5:17AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2018 5:32AM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now it's good to have separate cards for the monsters (it's not mandatory, I mean, we do fight some super big mobs) because then you can group and ungroup them as you wish just by stacking their cards and tapping them at the same time.

I was amazed at how fast, intuitive, organic and interesting combats became by treating them as out of combat interactions. <br/><br/>People in small groups naturally handle their own talking initiative and stop to hear others as they speak or as their names are called out. When a name is called everyone will remain silent and focus their attention on that person. So, people with interesting ideas naturally go first, people who become the focus of the action go naturally in their turn and all the time spent by players hesitation practically dissapears.<br/><br/>Often in D&amp;D and RPGs with boardgamey combats somebody in our group of players will naturally lose focus and fidget their phone or start a conversation while their turn comes, instead of paying attention to the action or thinking their strategy. It doesn't happen to everybody but someone will eventually do it. However using this procedure it has never happened to me. People keep their focus naturally as the conversation never stops and things keep happening.<br/><br/>Which takes me to the other main improvement to my preferred gaming style, which is making the monsters act whenever a player misses a roll in AW style. Except that then I never interrupted the game to check for the moves, but go with whatever sounded reasonable, cool and/or fit the world better. I Didn't dare to try all this in D&amp;D since it makes action economy feel the less organic part of the game and everything in D&amp;D is linked to it (class features, spells, attacks, actions, etc) But to me it sounds like you managed to fix 5e combats <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> yay!<br/><br/>Also, the less eye contact you have with the players while using this trick, the worse, more messy and slower it becomes. Looking down to write or check things not only makes your brain switch gears from action in the fiction to bookkeeping but it's also distracting for the players, so next you will all need to switch your focus back to the fictional world. It's barely an effort and you can say that it takes no time compared to usual boardgamey roleplaying, but it's enough to add road bumps.<br/><br/>That's why tapping works much much better than keeping track of things by writing in this playstyle. Whatever you can do without looking at it directly or lowering your head so much that it completely breaks eye-contact is the way to go in this playstyle.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472907/#Comment_472907" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-25T16:42:12+00:00" title="April 25, 2018  4:42PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dont understand how anybody wouldn't grab the gun first but if y'all say it works, I'll try that and report.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472911/#Comment_472911" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-25T18:05:51+00:00" title="April 25, 2018  6:05PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I dont understand how anybody wouldn't grab the gun first but if y'all say it works, I'll try that and report.</p></div></blockquote>\nIn PvP they would.

What feels fast can sometimes be just as valuable as what is fast, as long as it's the groups feeling that is taken into account rather than the DM.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've done neither of these since 2014. But I really prefered the second method then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472914/#Comment_472914" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-25T18:15:49+00:00" title="April 25, 2018  6:15PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The whole countdown/calling method is way worser T_T<br/>"anyone on 20-25" etc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472915/#Comment_472915" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-25T18:37:46+00:00" title="April 25, 2018  6:37PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They get their cards back after combat.

The total time of step (B) is the duration of the slowest player. The time for handing of the cards for the other three players is basically eaten up by that.<br/><br/>(F) doesn't slow down combat at all, since combat is over. Also, this step overlaps with the continuation of the game. I don't wait for people to take cards before continuing play. They can pick up their card at any time between the end of this combat and the beginning of the next.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472929/#Comment_472929" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-26T05:03:19+00:00" title="April 26, 2018  5:03AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really enjoying this discussion.<br/><br/>Don't have much to add... just listening/reading!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472931/#Comment_472931" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-26T05:08:17+00:00" title="April 26, 2018  5:08AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, if you have timed it out then that's great.

By the same reasoning, if a player isn't sure about what to do she will keep quiet for a while. If she's got a good idea she will be enthusiast enough about it that everybody will keep quiet to pay her attention. <br/><br/>We all read faces all the time, so it's usual that the person with the better idea ends up talking first. In the worst case you will have three players trying to talk at the same time, but even then you will see them take a pause to read each other faces for a moment and let one of them go first.<br/><br/>Once these players are done the GM asks to whoever hasn't participated yet, so the spotlight gets distributed equally and everyone feels like they got enough of it on their own personal pacing.<br/><br/>I like this "conversational initiative" more than any other method I've tried. It doesn't interrupt the flow of the fiction at all, so the whole fight feels like an uninterrupted part of the whole fiction, instead of a separate game. On the table, it doesn't feel like any tactical component is lost. You're not forced to think faster or drop the strategy. Coordination between players becomes easier and more natural, as you don't have to wait until the other player's turn.<br/><br/>Add the AW mechanic of making the opposition move whenever the players miss a roll and combat gets even more awesome: everything can go smoothly if the PCs plans run perfect, but as soon as someone drops the ball (by rolling low) the enemy catches up and counterattacks. But believe me, drop moves and fiat as fiction and your prep demands. The result feels a lot more like an action movie without roadbumps than your usual D&amp;D, perhaps even a bit faster than DW without losing anything.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472989/#Comment_472989" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-28T05:30:54+00:00" title="April 28, 2018  5:30AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk,<br/><br/>I'm confused by your last two sentences there.

Again, it's a road bump more than a sudden stop or anything, but if you really want fast gameplay I figure that you can drop the moves as they are and go a bit freeform. <br/><br/>After all you and your group already have interiorized a few methods to deal with situations like these. All you would need then is a single move to use as a principle: Whenever a player rolls the dice, either if it's a sucess or a miss, something happens. And when it's a miss, it's a GM move.<br/><br/>In play it feels like when a group of D&amp;D veterans plays without using the books and with improvise character sheets, and so the GM handwaves things, fiats some others and asks for rolls to determine how some forgotten rule is adjudicated. The result makes sense and keeps coherence because everyone is on the same page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473058/#Comment_473058" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-01T14:44:17+00:00" title="May  1, 2018  2:44PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry.

But here the tapping means main action and then I'll just have to try to keep track of reaction in my mind. Using a gimmick like flipping the card over-- naw, we'll see. Probably won't do that. As far as splitting apart bonus/main/move? Not sure, maybe that can be cool. I'll use the tapstatus to denote main action.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And does it get cumbersome for larger fights?</p></div></blockquote>\nOh, I hope not but so far the largest fight have been, hmm, we had a 6 v 4 fight but we also had an even messier fight where there where 6 people in a chaos of shifting goal and sides. They were trying to wrestle a guy and then he started running away some of them started shooting him which made others try to save him. It was amazing.<br/><br/>I know in Magic the card game we've had like hundreds vs hundreds (those Homarid Spawning Beds can get out of hand) and that works well, so\u2026 not scared of big fights here.

Also if you are using this initiative system you don\u2019t even have to charge them an action.</p><p>Alternatively, if the player is getting ready to shoot someone specific, the DM can use the <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/arrow_threat/" rel="nofollow">\u201carrow threat\u201d house rule</a> and ask for an aiming roll (same as attack roll vs AC, followed by damage roll).</p><ul><li>If they fail the aiming roll, don\u2019t \u201cklutz\u201d them, say something like \u201cit\u2019s taking you some time to find your bearing\u201d and move to next player</li><li>If they make the aiming roll and it\u2019s enough to kill the goblin, say \u201cyou find an opportunity for a perfect killing shot \u2013 do you let the arrow fly?\u201d</li><li>If they make the aiming roll and it\u2019s not enough to kill the goblin, subtract HP from the goblin. Its position/fortune is severely weakened</li></ul><blockquote><p>I jump over a barrel, throw a knife and shoot two arrows</p></blockquote><p>Never mind the barrels, that\u2019s just cool. That\u2019s just \u201cdifficult terrain\u201d worst case scenario (e.g.\xa0costs 5\u2019 of movement) and just cool flavor best case scenario.</p><p>For the attacks, two options:</p><ol><li>Nod approvingly and say \u201cFor the knife, make an attack roll\u201d. Then after that, move to the next player and then go back to the player. \u201cThe knife landed, and now the situation is [this, because other things happened], do you still want to shoot those arrows?\u201d <em>or</em></li><li>Have the player roll one attack (use best stats, bow&amp;arrow or knife) and if it succeeds, on damage roll, and have the knife and other arrows just be fluff.</li></ol><p>(With \u201carrow threat\u201d house rule, you can recover all arrows minus one-per-kill. So the \u201cwasted\u201d knife and arrows will be retrievable later.)</p><p>You could also combine it so that the knife is one attack, then the other players&amp;monsters do their thing, then the bow&amp;double-arrows are another. So either three, two, or one attack, depending on how you split/combine it.</p><p>Like, I usually don\u2019t do stuff like this because we don\u2019t describe combat actions in that sort of detail. We don\u2019t need it for \u201cclarity\u201d [uh <em>another</em> 2097 concept mixed in? so we have 1. the init system, 2. the \u201cwhen you\u2026\u201d key phrase for dealing with multipart actions, 3. the \u201carrow threat\u201d house rule and now 4. the clarity/zoom/pacing-control. But that is how it is.] so we tend to gloss over and just stick to what we\u2019re attempting within the action econ, since we are so familiar with it. We don\u2019t do the Mercer blow-narration thing</p><p>but</p><p>if a player starts doing stuff like this? This is one way to respond. Good luck have fun</p>\n<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475202/#Comment_475202" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-04T07:48:21+00:00" title="July  4, 2018  7:48AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2018 7:49AM by 2097.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I've usually been giving the first actions to players.

So instead of "tapping" cards (turning them sideways), <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/introducing-late-night-fighting#keeping-track" rel="nofollow">I use tally marks to count actions.</a> (That documentation uses Western tally marks but I've found that Asian tally marks (\u6b63) less ambiguous and faster to read. I just thought that that was beyond the scope of the article so I went with Western marks [which I grew up with] for the article to more quickly convey the point.)<br/><br/>Similar to Kutulu where I got the idea from in the first place.<br/><br/>In Kutulu, there is considerable "coldness". [In game design, "cold" situations are ones that reward acting last, "hot" situations are ones that reward acting first.] If you act, you then cannot defend and you make yourself VERY vulnerable for the rest of the round. You really, really, really want to hit last in Kutulu, not first. This coldness is conducive to letting the order be free; people tend to hesitate rather than be eager, to the point that the game has a provision where you miss your action entirely if you hesitate too much (which, given the extreme amount of zugzwang in Kutulu's combat system, might be what you want).<br/><br/>In D&amp;D 5e (uh\u2026 [looks at stack of house rules]\u2026 in <i>onstensibly</i> 5e) you usually want to act first since you can always defend, so the situations are almost always "hot". That's why my system now uses the system of "first strike"; if you act against someone who has first strike vs you, they get to do their action first. This differs from "full freestyling as if it were Dungeon World".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21615/5e-tapping-to-keep-track-of-action-econ" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21615/5e-tapping-to-keep-track-of-action-econ" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21615/5e-tapping-to-keep-track-of-action-econ/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21615%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21615%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
