Rather, it is an idea for a dueling card game.<br/><br/>One with 99.99% about what I love about trading card games in it and %.01 of what I hate about them.<br/><br/>Currently, it's in Early Design, and doesn't have a proper name.  Just call it Project: Shaper for now.<br/><br/>It's a set of rules for building cards with a point-buy system.  How is it point buy?  Why, more powerful cards have a higher initial cost in order to bring them into play.  Cards are more powerful if they have higher stats, more and/or more powerful special abilities, especially abilities that trigger - i.e., "Whenever you would draw any number of cards, instead draw double that number of cards;" "Whenever a character you control is destroyed, deal 2 damage to a character your opponent controls" - rather than being activated by your expenditure of actions or resources.<br/><br/>You also build an avatar that determines what kinds of resources you can spend at most every turn, and build a deck of 60 cards.<br/><br/>Then you go about proving that your unique cards are better than someone else's cards, by smacking that bitch's deck across the room using the integrated dueling rules.<br/><br/>Now my questions are:\n<ol><li>Does this sound cool?</li>\n<li>How workable is this idea?</li>\n<li>What design pitfalls should I look out for?</li>\n<li>There's no freaking way I'm going to be able to hold big tournaments of this, is there?</li></ol>\nThanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98481/#Comment_98481" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T19:17:49+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  7:17PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spin is probably a good place to talk about card games (mechanics, etc).

If this is the case then you are going to have much smaller market penetration as not that many are willing to print out their own cards. <br/><br/>If you are going to print it, and do small card runs, then you need to be careful of deck size. Some companies charge a set amount for like 50 cards and then add a cent amount on top for each card over that. The break for deck size seems to be about 60 and 120 cards.<br/><br/>Tournament wise, basically it comes off market penetration above. If you don't have that many people playing then torunaments are unwise as you need to support them and that requires investment. <br/><br/>I would be happy to help you out with intricacies of design if you are going to talk about it on the SPIN forums.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
