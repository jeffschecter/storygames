It might have something to do with the fact that the one game I've published is not this awesome game I'm totally psyched about, but rather a good game I had on the backburner for years and finally decided to make into a book. The game I'm working on at the moment I'm much more involved in, and might feel differently about (though I might well have tired of it by the time I get it published). I had the following reasons for publishing Oskrivna blad:<br/><br/>* People had been playing the free PDF I had put out and were nagging me to make it into a book.<br/>* I wanted to have a game published, as an achievement in and of itself.<br/>* I wanted to finish the project so I could move on to other stuff, and making a good-looking PDF takes about as much effort as publishing a book nowadays.<br/><br/>Anyway, "publishing" the game might not be that accurate a term, as all I did was upload a PDF to lulu. I ordered five copies to myself (for selling to people who asked me about it), though I accidentally mailed them to someone else who has sold most of them already. When I go to conventions, I will not bring a bunch of copies of my game with me to sell. I like to travel light and will only bring the games I want to play (i.e. I'll bring my own copy of the game, for play). I certainly don't want to give up any gaming time for sales.<br/><br/>I'm an extremely busy person, and any time spent promoting my game will have to be taken from some other activity. And, as I said, I find the promoting of the game to be a terrible bore, and though it's fun if people play my game, I know that they will do it anyway. It makes little difference to me wether it's 20 people or 200, and I'm pretty confident it will never be 2000.<br/><br/>I hope that might elucidate things. I really just wanted to make my game into a book, y'know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Svante%20Landgraf" title="Svante Landgraf"><img alt="Svante Landgraf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Svante%20Landgraf">Svante Landgraf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193216/#Comment_193216" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T06:32:54+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  6:32AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite><br/>The Kaleidioskop guys, though, do make money from their games, and I find them sitting around at conventions selling their games instead of playing games and having fun. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </blockquote>\nWell... we're talking about very small amounts of money here, mind you, and selling our games at conventions is kinda fun, really. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193217/#Comment_193217" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T06:44:13+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  6:44AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, okay, I think I get it.
