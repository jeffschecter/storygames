Examples can be found in recent threads, but I had real difficulty with some of the text in the Settlers Of Catan Card Game too, and El Grande among others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that scares me about the whole thing is publishing a game like that.  So I'm trying to be very aware of the assumptions which some game texts assume.  I'm trying to incorperate those into my writing, not to leave anything out.<br/>\n<br/>\nA problem I have is that, while I've never had any formal training in how to do it, I've always written technical docco as part of my job.  Good tech docco is easy to read, but very dry.  So I'm accutely aware that some of what I write has a trendancy toward dryness (and the current version of Danger Dudes is testament to this).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that in mind, I'm posting an excerpt from Uml\xc3\xa4ut: Heavy Metal Roleplaying for critique.  Basically, am I being facetious with this, is it redundant etc?  Does the text scan well?  Is it easy to understand etc etc?  Also, should I feel that I need to include this in the book?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>How Scenes are Played</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you're setting the scene (that is, when it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s your turn) you narrate the opening of the scenes however you like.  Some people like to narrate scenes in detail and others prefer to be more abstract, summarising their scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, one player might narrate the opening of a scene like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>I want a Practice Scene to raise my band\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Material.  My band hides away in someone\xe2\u20ac\u2122s apartment and write some more songs.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWhile another might narrate the same scene like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the inside of J\xc3\xbcrgen\xe2\u20ac\u2122s apartment and there are empty beer bottles everywhere.  Jacen and J\xc3\xbcrgen are slouched in chairs, Jacen with a guitar and J\xc3\xbcrgen with a harmonica in his mouth frantically scribbling notes in a spiral bound pad.  J\xc3\xbcrgen pauses to lift his beer and takes a gulp, not realising he still has his harmonica clamped between his lips.  He releases a startled cough, burp and gasp followed by an unpleasant blast of gurgling harmonica notes and desperate wheezing until Jacen performs the Heimlich manoeuvre on him to dislodge the drowned instrument.  Fortunately the lyrics to the new opus "My Sundered Terrier" are spared from the torrent.  Thusly, Doom Cow\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Material score goes up from two the three, and they lose two Cash.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIt\xe2\u20ac\u2122s important to note that both of these approaches are perfectly valid and neither is wrong.  Different players and different groups feel more comfortable with different levels of detail in their narration.  Your group and the players in it should find a level they are comfortable with and be safe in the knowledge that they are playing correctly.  Only namby pamby "new age" bands worry about that sort of thing: True Metal is always played correctly.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65637/#Comment_65637" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T03:58:13+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  3:58AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems OK to me. I would lose the "It's important to note that", and "and the players in it", which seem like dead wood, but the rest seems clear.<br>\n<br>\nIf you wanted more "bouncy", you could try something like "Which is correct? Both are just fine!". Some people find this style annoying, however.<br>\n<br>\nMind you, I tend towards "dry" myself, so I may not be the best person to comment.<br>\n<br>\nWhether it belongs in the book, I can't really say.

A lot of game texts seem reluctant to actually come out and tell you how you're "supposed" to play the game. Obviously, you can play any game however you want, but it's nice to be told how the designers <i>expect</i> people to play so you know how much mangling of core assumptions you might have to do to. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65732/#Comment_65732" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T11:01:50+00:00" title="April 27, 2007 11:01AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2007 1:14PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rich, I think there are many approaches to conveying this information.  In your case, I'd seriously consider doing it through examples of play, where you can demonstrate in action rather than in a didactic mode.  Two examples of play that (incidentally) illustrate wildly different approaches to narration would, I think, be more effective, particularly since it will help set the Metal tone quite strongly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65796/#Comment_65796" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T12:58:20+00:00" title="April 27, 2007 12:58PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Examples of play are always good (especially when they really are examples of <i>play</i>, instead of just, like, examples of <i>rules</i>).
