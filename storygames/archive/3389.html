Now, admittedly, some of you might not see it that way.<br/><br/>Right before I got into Indie Games (specifically, those with a small time investment and with high focus on Fun Now), my wife agreed to try out this RPG stuff.<br/><br/>She bought a mini for her D&amp;D character. We had a short campaign. She wasn't having much fun. She gave it one final try when I found this new group of people in the area. Jason M. ran Dogs in the Vineyard. She still doesn't like roleplaying - too improv intensive for her tastes.<br/><br/>I am fine with this. I would have preferred a gamer wife, but it just isn't going to happen. This isn't the weird part, though.<br/><br/>Her best friend, we'll call her W, went out to eat with us the other night. We were all talking about random things when my wife brought up one of our favorite TV series, Freaks and Geeks. I immediately laugh and reminisce about the final episode, wherein the Freak sits down with the Geeks and plays Carlos, the Dwarf.<br/><br/>W exclaims (having remembered at that point what my big (hidden?) hobby was), "Oh my god! I've always wanted to play D&amp;D!" She later on commented that she could only do it with people she trusted. She was looking to me to provide this, which I can help her with.<br/><br/>This is not an issue of trust with my wife, nor is it a communication issue (at least between the two of us). It's just, well, weird at this point. I think she's afraid, deep down, that W will start liking it. However, she has given her blessing for us four (W, her husband, my wife and I) to do something together.<br/><br/>I guess I just had to share, was all. Anybody else had any similarly weird situations because their spouse/SO didn't roleplay?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76630/#Comment_76630" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T11:02:01+00:00" title="June 19, 2007 11:02AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not like that really.

My SO is really hesitant to play for fear not just of not winning, but of not looking competent or smart. She also resents the way that RPGs, and many other games the way my crowd plays them, completely absorb a person socially so that there's no room for any other sort of interaction until the game is over. <br/><br/>This latter viewpoint is starting to persuade me. I mean, why are there no RPGs that you can play in 20-second increments while you're mostly doing something else? Why is there so much commitment required? Why don't (m)any LARPs have a switch that says 'no, I'm not interested in that kind of interaction right now'? That'd be a huge step.

It wasn't until a 1/2 hour into the game when one of them looked into the big bowl of dice and said, "Wait, are we really playing D&amp;D??"<br/><br/>They had a lot of fun, but it's interesting to see the visceral reaction of some total non-gamers to RPGs just based on what they've *heard* in the past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76757/#Comment_76757" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T03:28:10+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  3:28AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My wife doesn't game.

Ever. No further discussion entered into. In every other way she is about the perfect partner for a gamer, but she will not entertain the concept of gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell we hung out with each other when we were teenagers and she was seeing someone else and he invited her to play in his group. They were playing FASA Star Trek. She was the Communications Officer (Uhura-clone, natch) and she was told (and I kid you not, this was years before Galaxy Quest came out!) to just repeat what the GM told her to say, to the Captain. Which she dutifully did, believing that this was roleplaying. When she tried to do something different, she was told that wasn't her job and as she was 'just an Ensign' she didn't have a say anyway. When she tried to make an OOC suggestion she got her Star Wars and her Star Trek terminologies mixed up and was lampooned by the group for the rest of the session. At the end of the first session the GM suggested that she might want to think more about how she could contribute to the game 'like maybe, trying to act in character once.' She continued with this torture for a couple of sessions and then made her excuses and never returned.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are games that I would *love* to have her try, but it's impossible. She's REALLY supportive of me and my hobbies and in every other way you would think she is a gamer (she's an unabashed geek, like me) but she will not throw dice or flop cards with anyone. Which is really sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan" title="urbanpagan"><img alt="urbanpagan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/urbanpagan/Other%20Schtuff/urbanpaganavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan">urbanpagan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76790/#Comment_76790" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T10:20:47+00:00" title="June 20, 2007 10:20AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>It's perfectly OK to have different hobbies from your SO, just so long as you don't have different lives.</blockquote>\nThat statement right there is GOLD!  Gold I tell you!  Underline that a few times and then tattoo it on my back!  Seriously.  <br><br>I have hobbies that Eric does not share.  He has hobbies I do not share.  Fact of life.  *shrug*  The only advice (and I know you said you really didn't want any but I'm telling you, your post screams for advice) is to tell your SO why it's important (yes important) to you that they be interested in at least trying some more gaming.  It's better to air your wants/desires than to harbor them/hinder them and let them stew until it ends up causing strife between you.  At least I think so anyway.  If your SO still doesn't want to game, oh well, you told them it was important to you and that's what is important in itself IMO.  <br><br>My $0.02 for what it's worth.<br><br>Lisa P                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mikael" title="Mikael"><img alt="Mikael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mikael">Mikael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76877/#Comment_76877" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T01:57:57+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  1:57AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Experiences...

She bellydances (three classes a week), so we each have something we do without the other (although I don't make her come and watch me game).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe does enjoy board games.
