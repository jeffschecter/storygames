(Seriously miss you, dude, but I hope you're still having fun back on the other coast!)<br><br>Sounds totally doable to me.  People play "Jedi in the Vineyard," and Clinton's hack <i>The Princes' Kingdom</i> does the Dogs thing in Earthsea, so I think you're within acceptable perameters.<br><br>IMO, one of the thornier issues with Dogs hacks is settings in which you don't have guns, which can complicate the Talking-Physical-Fighting-Shooting escalation stages. Crossbows just don't have the same "inherantly dangerous" vibe. Magic seems like it could be a good replacement (especially in dark fantasy like Warhammer) but it's often a lateral movement as much as an escalation. And replacing the very specific context of "shooting" (a gun fight) with a more general one like "killing" (same as fighting but... deadlier?) is also problematic.<br/><br/>I see the competing faiths thing as less of a problem.  There are competing faiths in Dogs, right? (everybody loves false worship!)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368181/#Comment_368181" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T17:10:21+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  5:10PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about brawling with fists vs. the guy who pulls a knife?

This is exactly the part of the discussion that I want to get deeper into.  That said, I'm going to push back on your stated list of problems, because right now I don't see them as showstoppers.  If you want to elaborate then I'm eager to hear more details of where the Devil is in the details.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Mmmmm... I see some problems...<br><br>1) The Red Goddess really exist. She is real, she talks with her worshippers, you can meet her via heroquesting. So, not only you have a "fixed" faith, that already say to you what you have to do in every case, but in doubt, you can ask the GM.<br/></br></br></blockquote>\nI don't see that this necessarily has to be any more true for the Red Goddess than for the King of Life in canonical Dogs.  There's a much quoted (and possibly apocryphal) story of a contest in a con Dogs game where a player had his character pray to God for guidance and Vincent (allegedly) replied, "Okay.  You roll.  I give.  What does God tell you to do?"  Whether this story is true or not, it seems to me that this would be a perfectly valid approach to take with the Red Goddess.  She is, after all, famed as a goddess who embraces contradiction.  It's not like they are Rokari faithful or something.\n<blockquote><br>2) Sin in Glorantha is not the same thing as in our society.<br/></br></blockquote>\nWell, based on where I'm living, sin is not exactly the same as it is in the world of <i>Dogs</i> either.  Okay, I don't mean to be a smart-ass about it.  But in fact a big part (most) of why I'm looking for an alternate "skin" for Dogs is precisely that my largely atheist-humanist players are going to have a hard time looking at the game's treatment of polygamy, fidelity rules, gender inequality and so on and end up making PCs who are framed as a <i>critique</i> of organized religion.

But then it hit me that I could combine this with my longstanding wish to run a Gloranthan Lunars game and maybe do something a little more interesting.\n<blockquote><br>3) The structure of society is different<br/></br></blockquote>\nAs with the above, I have to agree with this statement but it equally seems true between the Territories of Dogs and the society in which I live.  I'm not saying there may not be structural elements in society that are problematic!  I'm asking you to enumerate some of the problems you think I'll face.\n<blockquote><br>4) The cult of the Red Goddess teach acceptance. Even of Chaos. The enemies are non spiritual ones but foreign gods and people.<br/></br></blockquote>\nHmmmmm.  Now I think we're getting to the real meat of the issue.  I actually think this is really interesting.  Because the "enemies" really are <i>foreign ways of living</i>, right?  Foreign worship practices, foreign magics, foreign faiths.  And yet Sedenya preaches "We are all us".  I actually think that this makes for a really cool moral and cultural struggle.  It's not <i>the same struggle</i> as in vanilla Dogs (and I'm willing to hear why that's problematic) but it's an interesting struggle nonetheless.<br/><br/>Compare and contrast the view of the Dogs to the Mountain People to the view of a Lunar towards the Grazers (for example).  In the former case, there are a number of examples in the Dogs rulebook of various scenarios where congregations who think that the Mountain People have wisdom they could learn from, and which might be divine or valuable in its own right, are treading on the ways of Sin.  Dogs players who're going by the book might feel driven to turn the Faithful away from the practices of the Mountain People.  But they aren't really focussed on the Mountain People themselves but on the Faithful whom they might corrupt.  Whereas in a putative Lunar Missionaries game the missionaries are interested in the Grazers themselves.  And they're okay with the Grazers continuing to do their thing, spiritually, provided they also add in Lunarism as a kind of meta-layer on top of their own religion.  So on the one hand they have to prove something to the Grazer community in order to get them on board with the worship of Sedenya.  On the other hand, they have to prove to themselves that they are more than just the PR wing of a conquering army -- that they actually <i>do</i> represent a way of life and a code of living that's superior and that will lead to greater satisfaction and happiness.<br/><br/>I'm willing to hear that this approach to play will take some of the slack out of the sails in terms of the inherent dramatic tension of Dogs' rules.  But it at least seems to me that it could be interesting.\n<blockquote><br/>You risk turning the game in a sort of "mission-based" fighting game.<br/></blockquote>\nOkay.  I see that if the morality underpinnings and the player-driven moral decisions get kicked out from under the game then that will be true.  But as I've tried to articulate above I don't think that this is a necessary consequence of the direction I want to take this game in.  It may yet be a possible consequence and I may be missing some key observations which will help me come to that conclusion.  But that's why I'm talking about it here, rather than starting to stat things up.<br/><br/>That took longer than I thought it would to write.  I'll come back to talk about the escalation ladder in a subsequent post.  (Spoiler:  I agree that crossbows are not the answer.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368404/#Comment_368404" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T21:01:20+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  9:01PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2012 9:02PM by Moreno R..">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Robert.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Ahrens</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><br/>1) The Red Goddess really exist. She is real, she talks with her worshippers, you can meet her via heroquesting. So, not only you have a "fixed" faith, that already say to you what you have to do in every case, but in doubt, you can ask the GM.<br/></blockquote>\nI don't see that this necessarily has to be any more true for the Red Goddess than for the King of Life in canonical Dogs.  There's a much quoted (and possibly apocryphal) story of a contest in a con Dogs game where a player had his character pray to God for guidance and Vincent (allegedly) replied, "Okay.  You roll.  I give.  What does God tell you to do?"  Whether this story is true or not, it seems to me that this would be a perfectly valid approach to take with the Red Goddess.  She is, after all, famed as a goddess who embraces contradiction.  It's not like they are Rokari faithful or something.<br/><br/>In that actual play bit, the game doesn't say that the King of Life exist. The Character could hear demonic voices, or only the voices of his madness and fanaticism. Or maybe he only get a flash of inspiration.<br/><br/>The specific bit that talk about this in the game manual was not clear for a lot of people, so Vincent said it in another way:  "The GM has to play as if the king of life doesn't really exist"<br/><br/>This mean that God can't be played as a NPC, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ever</span>. It's one of the moral focal points of the game.  It's explicit in the rules.<br/><br/>Why? Because the narrative tension in DitV lives in the border between the dog's faith and the player's human empathy with the people if the branch. If the players don't care for the people, or if they have a  NPC God that tell them "what is right", the game simply doesn't "take off": there is no tension, one side overpower the other.  The Dogs become uncaring inquisitors and the game become boring because it's not really made for being used to simulate battles between inquisitors and demons.  The players can easily destroy anything the GM put against them, if they don't care about anything apart winning.<br/><br/>Even if the Red Goddess say only what the player want, this give the character the real, objective "truth" of what they gave to do.  You exchange personal decision and responsibility with the usual "your superior says that you have to do this" scenario.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>2) Sin in Glorantha is not the same thing as in our society.<br/></blockquote>\nWell, based on where I'm living, sin is not exactly the same as it is in the world of<i>Dogs</i>either.  Okay, I don't mean to be a smart-ass about it.  But in fact a big part (most) of why I'm looking for an alternate "skin" for Dogs is precisely that my largely atheist-humanist players are going to have a hard time looking at the game's treatment of polygamy, fidelity rules, gender inequality and so on and end up making PCs who are framed as a<i>critique</i>of organized religion.

But these are "sins", not SINS. You don't care a bit for them. The player don't care a bit for them. How can the character care?<br/><br/>You should use Sins that hurt people. (the list on the manual is a list of these kind of sin)<br/><br/>Let's move all this to Glorantha. And try to say to a Stom Buller that is a "sin" to kill his enemies, or that a Sword of Humakt has to care for the life of people. <br/><br/>Glorantha is a fantasy world where everybody is in an eternal struggle to win a eternal war.  Apart from some healing cult, I don't know any Gloranthian cult that would consider killing an enemy a sin. Most of them would consider a Sin NOT killing them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368425/#Comment_368425" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T06:07:36+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  6:07AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2012 6:08AM by Rafu.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Ahrens</cite>But in fact a big part (most) of why I'm looking for an alternate "skin" for Dogs is precisely that my largely atheist-humanist players are going to have a hard time looking at the game's treatment of polygamy, fidelity rules, gender inequality and so on and end up making PCs who are framed as a<i>critique</i>of organized religion.

Not once have I met a <i>player</i> or prospective player (myself included) who wasn't strongly prejudiced <i>against</i> the Faith and its proposed values: in my opinion that "metaplay level" conflict is exactly where the game draws its energy from. Some players choose to make their Dog a "good faithful" and are then at odds with their own character. Some other players stat up a troublemaker, a reluctant and un-faithful Dog, escalating their judgment of the setting to in-character level right from the onset. Either way, there's so much fruitful tension to power the game. I'm also fond of reminding everybody that their characters are <i>clueless teens with guns and absolute (theoretical) authority</i>\u2026                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens" title="Robert Ahrens"><img alt="Robert Ahrens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/664/n4GHDX832T7IU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens">Robert Ahrens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368546/#Comment_368546" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T17:31:48+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  5:31PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for these responses.  They're pretty thought provoking.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Moreno">@Moreno</a>, I absolutely agree that God shouldn't be present in scenes as an NPC in any version of Dogs.  But I'm not sure that means that God can't <i>exist</i> in the setting.  For instance, one of the ways to re-skin the game that Vincent actually discusses in the rulebook was to make the PCs mob enforcers.  In that setting, presumably, the role of God is taken by the Don.  As GM, you could rule that the PCs are never granted an audience with the Don on-camera and that they're never able to get a direct answer out of his lieutenants as to what he thinks they should do.  But the players would know at some level that the Don existed in the world and had opinions, right?  Would that spoil things?  How is this different from the situation with the Red Goddess?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Moreno">@Moreno</a>, I think your second line of reasoning -- about sins in Gloranthan cultures -- is a lot more dissuasive to me.  The real distinction that I see here is that in the Lunar missionary situation the PCs would not be setting out to enforce right action on members of their <i>own</i> culture but rather to subjugate and persuade members of other cultures.  While there's a certain amount of this in vanilla Dogs (folk from back East, Territorial Authority Marshalls who don't hold with the Faith, Mountain People, etc) the emphasis is definitely on travelling amongst communities of the Faithful and policing them, which is very different from the missionary situation I'm envisioning.  So I can see a real distinction here and it certainly seems possible that things won't map over.  If you're journeying to oversee a single Lunarized family in a Heortling stead (even assuming they were allowed to live there) that makes the conflict much more the PCs versus the community as an extension of the larger conflict in Dragon Pass and much less about the sins and ethical dilemmas of the community.  This definitely gives me pause.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a>, great point.  I'd never really thought about the benefits of the tension induced by players' antipathy towards the Faith.  While you've helped me see that this can actually add a real layer of piquancy to the game, I would say that I have definitely seen instances where it's served as an impediment:  Players just find the tenets of the Faith <i>too</i> objectionable and they end up coming up with a character that's a pretty broad pastiche of negative stereotypes of religious crusader.  The trouble with this type of character is that if the player thinks that the character is a moron, dupe or psychopath -- or worse, feels that he or she can't even grasp <i>where</i> the character is coming from at all -- then I don't think they get as much out of, or give as much to the game.  It collapses all the tension out of play if you're willing to say, "Well of course it's a bloody disaster, what did you expect?" and not feel a pang of guilt along with that.<br/><br/>By way of contrast, I think that the game can work perfectly well with PCs who are tasked with enforcing a morality which the players <i>do</i> agree with.  The truth is that making good moral decisions and balancing ethics in real world situations is extremely challenging.  Even if the players all agree about what is righteous (unlikely) I think that play could still be very tense and interesting as the group explored down into the firmament of space to be found by repeatedly challenging their own previous decisions.  So while I do see that there's a genuine frisson to be had by playing characters who're rooted in a faith framework that's not your own, my first instinct is to say that that's not necessary in order for Dogs to deliver tense and rewarding play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368550/#Comment_368550" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T18:25:38+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  6:25PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion about the tension between player beliefs and morality and the Faith's is extremely interesting to me. When I first started playing, I expected to feel huge antipathy towards the Faith, and was worried that the game would fail as a result*.<br/><br/>In actual play, I was surprised by how much sympathy I developed for the Faithful. I could see that their Faith was a source of strength for them as much as it was also a terrible burden. I think this attitude was helped by the way the game puts the Faith in a precarious position, threatened by settlers from Back East, vulnerable to collapse from within. Our game kind of became an elegy for this beautiful, flawed, dying way of life.<br/><br/>I think one of the roles of the GM is to portray the Faithful as people: flawed people, but with good intentions. They're human before they're Faithful, and I think that makes them very sympathetic. Our best games came when the town pitted something great about the Faith (strong communities, caring families, mutual support) against something awful about it (xenophobia, intolerance, hierarchy). Problematising the "great" parts, and recontextualising the "awful" parts was really fruitful material for play.<br/><br/>* Interestingly, this is exactly what <i>did</i> happen in a later game of Montsegur 1244. The Cathars had a shitty, shitty set of beliefs, and I couldn't, no matter how hard I tried, get myself into the mindset of someone who would die for that shitty religion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
