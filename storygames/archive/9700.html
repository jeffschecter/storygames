After a few short playtesting sessions, I have felt that the way conflict resolution is handled needs to be refined. Let me see if I can explain myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, most obstacles, whether they are fights, treks across difficult landscapes, fast-talking someone, or researching a piece of information, are handled in a single roll. Before dice hit the table, players set stakes like "If I win, my character defeats these bandits", or "If I win, we overcome any obstacles and make it to the lost city of St. Louis". The GM will then state a difficulty, and set counter-stakes like "If you lose, the bandits capture your character, and haul him off to their camp", or "If you lose, you will become lost".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players who I have been playtesting with come from a variety of experience with RPGs, but one thing that I have noticed is that sometimes stakes are set to perform simple tasks ("I want to jump this car on my motorcycle") and other times entire conflicts ("I want to escape these guys chasing me").<br/>\n<br/>\n((Note-- I have read some articles (and a few old threads here) on the difference between task and conflict resolution, and I think I got a pretty good, though not perfect, handle on it))<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, I would like conflicts in the Waste to be on a smaller scale. Players should be able to make single rolls to do things like defeating small groups of enemies, gaining entry into a secure compound, or earning a villager's trust. Players shouldn't be able to make single rolls to "kill all the people in this area" or "gain access to all of the bandits' safehouses in the city".<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I also don't want conflict stakes to be too small. For example, if the task a PC is performing is "swinging a baseball bat at the enemy", and you ask why, different players might give different responses:<br/>\n<br/>\n1: "to knock him unconscious".<br/>\n2: "to knock him down".<br/>\n3: "to kill him"<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the above examples, presumably the what's at stake is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1: Does the enemy get knocked unconscious?<br/>\n2: Does the enemy get knocked down?<br/>\n3: Does the enemy get killed?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, some players might set their stakes as the 2nd choice, and then decide to set up a follow-up conflict or roll to determine if the man dies. To me, this is a problem with the player not realizing what they can accomplish with one roll, and I am not sure how to address it. One possible solution is to ask a player what they want out of a particular scene or conflict, but sometimes, that can't even be made explicitly clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, onto my specific question: When setting stakes for a conflict, are there any games out there with good examples on how to apply scale constraints? Are there any games that do a particularly good job defining what kinds of conflicts are permissible within its rules, and which aren't?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I tell a player that "I want to escape this cell" is a valid conflict to handle in a single roll, but "I want to infiltrate this entire secret society" or "I want to gun down the entire town militia" isn't?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope all that is clear; maybe it's just been a strange week, but I am really struggling to articulate this. Any help would be very appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215468/#Comment_215468" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T13:17:50+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  1:17PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2009 1:18PM by komradebob.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See if you can locate Dave Berg's pacing chart thingie.

You had me from the moment you said "post-apocalyptic", and I'm pretty impressed with what I've seen of your design. <br><br>Anyhoo, as always, check out <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow">Roleplaying Theory, Hardcore</a> for Vincent Baker's really clear take on the subject.<br><br>As for the issue of scale, you *can* just tell the player "no, sorry. This is too broad to be handled in one roll." \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Charlie Gilb</cite>The players who I have been playtesting with come from a variety of experience with RPGs, but one thing that I have noticed is that sometimes stakes are set to perform simple tasks ("I want to jump this car on my motorcycle") and other times entire conflicts ("I want to escape these guys chasing me").<br/></blockquote>\nHo-kay. Well, continuing the scale issue, a task is not a conflict. The only time that jumping something with your bike is the object of the conflict is when, say, an NPC specifically dares your character to do so.<br><br>If a player gives you just a task, ask them "why do you want to do that?" That should reveal what's at stake for the player in this situation. For example, with the task mentioned above, let's concoct a scenario: your guy Max is escaping a road gang on his motorcycle, and he's ducked down an alley that's too narrow for them to follow. Good thinking! Ah, but then they come around to the other mouth of the alley and block it with a Buick. Crap! In this case, the proposed task is embedded in "I want to escape these guys chasing me", and Driving would make the most sense to apply the player's chosen escape method. <br><br>If they only give you a conflict, ask "how do you want to do that?" If they say "I want to escape", you ask them "How?" Don't assume any foregone conclusions here. The player might select Driving, he might select Gun-fighting, he might select Bluffing (to play dead, if they want him dead? Or fake a nasty disease if they need to take him alive and bring him back somewhere?). Yeah, the bad guys are a car-gang, but that doesn't mean the player *must* handle the situation through driving and chases and such. You could even take a moment of downtime during the larger chase-scene to implement the player's idea, as well - they're chasing you, but you don't have to beat them just by running. <br><br>Clear as mud, right? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215477/#Comment_215477" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T13:36:08+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  1:36PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2009 1:37PM by Jesse.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charlie,<br><br>In my experience the best way to constrain the scope of outcomes in Stake setting games is to get the player to clarify what fictional action their character is taking to make those Stakes happen.  It's usually pretty clear when you need to break something down if the player can't justify the outcome from that single concrete action.<br><br>However "single concrete action" needs some qualifiers.  Your swinging a bat is a good example.  The idea isn't that the Stakes resolve a single swing of the bat but that "beating him with a bat" can be considered a "single action."  This concept scales quite nicely.<br><br>Consider the player sets the Stakes as, "I infiltrate the secret society."  Ask, "How do you do that?"  Notice it's pretty hard to explain how he accomplishes that in a single go.  He'll say something like, "Well, first I make friends with someone within the organization."  Then you say, "Great, let's resolve that."<br><br>However, given certain properties of the character's fictional status he might very well say, "I deploy my spy network."  That is indeed an acceptable "single action" that might very well accomplish "infiltrating the secret society."  So I'd allow it.<br><br>Stake setting games suffer from a minor social weakness that they can evolve into narrative power-grabbing where the players abandon the fiction in favor of trying to muscle as much narrative control as they can grab to guarantee the story is the one they want.  You stop this by making them justify everything they want to accomplish in terms of what their character is actually doing right then and there in the fiction to achieve it.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215482/#Comment_215482" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T13:45:33+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  1:45PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2009 1:53PM by Charlie Gilb.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert- Thanks for the link! David's dial idea is quite interesting, and it's cool hearing about other groups with different player expectations as far as pacing goes; that is precisely what I have run into.<br/>\n<br/>\nZac- I got the difference between them down pretty well, but let's take a look at the motorcycle jumping example, which actually happened in a playtest a few days ago:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players were refueling at a gas station when a few 'robots on motorcycles' (totally in the style of Terminator: Salvation) waylaid them and started firing upon the PCs' dune buggy. He announced he wanted to hop in the dune buggy, pick up the other PC, and tear out of the gas station. He started picking up dice, so I asked him to clarify his stakes. He said that he wanted to get out of the gas station, and I asked if he wanted to escape the robots. No, he replied. He just wanted to get out of the gas station.<br/>\n<br/>\nDice hit the table, and he succeeds. The robots give chase. Now, the way my mechanics work is that even successful rolls can give rise to GM-created narrative complications. He had rolled enough low dice, and I was allowed to introduce something big, so I said a huge tank appeared on the road in front of him, levelling its turret at the buggy. The player says: "I want to Dukes of Hazzard this fucking tank". I asked why, and after a bit of talking, he just wants to do it because it is cool. Eventually, the stakes we set were that if he succeeds, he jumps it, and the two motorcycles crash. If he fails, the tank shoots the dune buggy and they are sent flying. Obviously, the difference between conflict and task were a bit muddied here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see two issues here: the first, is that the player could have escaped the robots in a single roll, but didnt want to, which is fine. The real issue, I think (for those a little familiar with my design), is that players have a chance of losing Grit (the "life points" of the game) <i>for any failed rolls</i>. As I am typing this, I am starting to think THAT is the real problem, because people who try to settle things on a smaller scale are penalized for doing so. The PC mentioned above was nearly dead by the end of the session, simply because the stakes for many of his rolls were smaller. That is certainly not a design goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like if there was a way to codify upper and lower level scale constraints on the resolution system, this wouldnt be as much of an issue, but perhaps I am wrong.

You may decide that the sections far to the left or right are too big and too small. That right there should help.<br><br>2) Alternatively, if they have some sort of skills/attributes/whateveryoucallems, you could tie them to those chunks on Dave's arc. Off the cuff, take just these example ones:<br><br>Trick shooter<br>Small Unit Tactician<br>Logistics wizard<br><br>Trick shooter is probably going to be resolving stuff at a pace/scope closer to the left jhand side of the cart. as the player of a character with that skill tries to resolve stuff going right on the arc, that skill/attribute would probably be less releevant or need more steps or more justification. Small unit Tactician probably sets somewhere in the middle of the pacing scale, Logistics Wizard on the left end, and probably has the reverrse problem of the Trick-shooter; The Logistics Wizard might be able to fairly call for a scope of resolution involving moving a column of beat-up Road Warrior nomads across an atomic wasteland in only a roll-off or two. OTOH, Logistics Wizardry won't count for all that much in Bullet-time.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215498/#Comment_215498" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T14:26:22+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  2:26PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2009 2:26PM by Charlie Gilb.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert-<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) As of now, I think the resolution mechanics should scale between "Real-time" and "Scene Summary". It is actually very helpful to think of things that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) Right now, a PC's abilities are divided into 10 'Aspects', and 4 'Gear'. The player gives these 14 slots whatever name he wishes, as long as everyone at the table is on board with the themes and imagery they evoke. This has yielded vastly different types of characters with equally varied levels of abilities in certain areas. I have had 1 guy who can accumulate about 8 dice (which is A LOT) to swing an axe, and another guy, who through higher scale narration, has accumulated an equal amount to resolve an entire travel sequence in one roll, like you were talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again, it seems like the real trick here is to not penalize people according to the scale that they wish to play at for each scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215515/#Comment_215515" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T14:56:45+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  2:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do your players feel about having characters with Aspects/Gear that function at different pacing/scale?

I imagine that in longer playtesting sessions, this could become a problem; 'road-trip guy' won't get to roll nearly as often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215533/#Comment_215533" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T15:19:41+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  3:19PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac- Spending Grit in that way is <i>exactly</i> the idea I have been toying around with in the last day or so.

Having a flat currency that players <i>always</i> make a choice to spend seems to be more fitting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215538/#Comment_215538" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T15:29:17+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  3:29PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So, it seems like you could solve this by simply constraining the number of rolls that can happen in a [time unit], and ensuring that characters get appx equal time units of play.</p>\n<p>If the possible consequences of a roll are only Grit loss and fictional results, that might be a problem as well; make it desirable to use most of your rolling opportunities.</p>\n<p>Possibly also mechanically/economically link the rolls together somehow, so that small-task guy and big-task guy will habitually alter the fiction in different <em>ways,</em> but the mechanical results of those alterations have the same impact.</p>\n<p>Nothing could be simpler!
