Minimaclamorrow is my friend Vic.<br/><br/>**************************<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>I spritz you with water!<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>i scream in agony as little pustules form about my flesh where contact is made!<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>I feed you rings of fried dough to take away the pain.<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>the unmetabolized fat from the snacks leak through the open sores spread across my body<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>I blast you with a fire hose to dispell the foul contaminants.<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>the force of the water, moving through the many clogged wounds at pressures unmeasurable by man, tears my entire body asunder!<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>Awesome.<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>sexually stimulating<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>I take the puddle of glop that was once you, distill it into a potent elixir, and fill a large syringe with it.<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>i, y'know, go along with it<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>Killer.<br/>I inject Vic Serum into 25 slightly different species of lab mouse.<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>they all suddenly become irresistable to the opposite sex<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>The test subjects consisting of 12 male and 13 female mice, mad mouse fornication ensues.<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>after a severe reproductive boom, during which the number of mice increase from 25 to 625, the fornication abruptly ends.  the mice begin to show common hive-mind behavior<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>In unison, they begin erecting a giant altar in the shape of an "8" out of bread crumbs and wood chips.<br/><br/>**************************<br/><br/>At this point, things begin to get a bit silly, so I'll jump ahead in the conversation:<br/><br/><br/>**************************<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>8 others say, "fuck that."  the other 33 are undecided.  individuality begins to seep back into the collective consciousness of the mice.  but it is too late.<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>The "fuck that" mice and the altar begin revolving around each other and a rapidly accelerating speed.  The bright flash of light that follows blinds the 33 survivors, and when their vision clears they see on the ground a golden idol.<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>it says, "paul mccartney is dead."<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>I open the cage a tad and ask the golden idol, "Who has been pretending to be Paul McCartney all these years?"<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>the golden idol responds, "william campbell"<br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>I go Google William Campbell.<br/><br/>Minimaclamorrow: <br/>you find this:  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=william+campbell" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=william+campbell</a><br/><br/>argonbunnies: <br/>I assume the William Campbell in question is the composer.
