No one has ever known we were among you... until now."  \u2014 Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez<br/><br/>Almost no Immortal can now deny that the time of the Gathering is at hand, yet there are some who whisper of a danger still greater.  They say that in this age of increasing electronic surveillance and ever-better record keeping, it is only a matter of time before the governments of the world discover the Immortal presence among them.  They might exterminate you, your wisdom and power lost without a Quickening.  Or, they may torture and twist you until you break, becoming tools in their endless, pointless squabbles.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, as the number of duels fought yearly increases, strange rumors begin to circulate.  Those who win begin to resemble their conquered foes, in mannerism, dress, and behavior.  Several of the most successful swordsmen have gone insane, and either allowed themselves to be decapitated or simply disappeared.<br/><br/>With such threats hanging over you, Immortals are becoming increasingly isolated, even hermetic.  What mortal man, woman, or child can you trust not to reveal your secret?  Meanwhile, among your fellow Immortals, even friendships centuries old are beginning to fray, as all eyes turn, however reluctantly, to the Prize.<br/><br/>The final battle draws ever nearer, yet you begin to wonder: even if you win, who will you be?<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I am looking to start a Highlander campaign using a modified version of The Riddle of Steel.  It will run on Wednesdays, from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM, most likely at my apartment on the Upper East Side of New York City with occasional forays to other locales in the city.  The game will likely last the duration of the semester, though possibly slightly shorter or slightly longer.  I am looking for between two and four <i>committed, mature</i> players to join in the fun and decapitation.  Character generation and pre-campaign discussion will happen on Wednesday, January 14th, and we will begin playing the week after.<br/><br/>I am happy to teach the mechanics, but do be aware that the TRoS combat system is fairly rules-heavy, and quite deadly.  The Spiritual Attributes chosen by the players will guide the story; you must have the mettle to back up your beliefs.<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185999/#Comment_185999" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T23:21:25+00:00" title="January  4, 2009 11:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.
