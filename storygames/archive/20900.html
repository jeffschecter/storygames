The GMing ones have the advantage of writeups right here on SG :-) (Spoilers for <i>Masks of Nyarlathotep</i> and <i>Eternal Lies</i>)<br/><br/><b>Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep</b>, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/423738/#Comment_423738" rel="nofollow">Session IX</a>: Normally I only GM when we have a quorum of 3, but one play is usually a bit late so I started with two players. As it turns out, the third had come down with bronchitis, which we didn't find out until well into the session; and this time the session was gold with just two players.<br/><br/>Both their PCs were private eyes, wandering around an Irish village where there was an Anglo-British woman with lycanthropy, her aristocratic family trying to keep it under wraps, and another werewolf with a sinister motive. The chemistry between Francis and Jimmy was often hysterical, but the whole session grabbed a noir tone early and never let go, down to the downbeat ending. It also featured the <i>greatest Biology spend in the history of Gumshoe!</i> All in all, my favorite session of the campaign.<br/><br/><b>Eternal Lies</b>, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/448421/#Comment_448421" rel="nofollow">Episode VII</a>: this was actually the second half of our session; after a very tense fight underground in Mexico city with a Mythos cultist/wanna be Communist, the PCs moved on to the Yucatan. And there my players gave me the greatest gift I have ever received as a GM: they turned our tense horror game temporarily into a Neil Simon sex farce. We zoomed in and out on the various couples as they spent a night of (mostly) frustration.<br/><br/>And as a player, both owe the the wonderful gamer Jeff Collyer at Dreamation:<br/><br/>2015: <b>Monsterhearts</b>, in a just-post WWII setting. I played the Chosen, a young German girl whose mother had married a GI and whose powers were totally not the result of <i>COUGH Nazi Occult Science COUGH</i>. We set out to have some kind of Big Bad but the session ended up being about the cliques of the Vampire/Fae/Mortal (who died but took the Ghoul resurrection move to be vampiric) and the Werewolf/Chosen. It ended in a confrontation at the water tower, where my character uttered the immortal line: "Ve haff a saying in my country: Effing, <i>die</i>, b---!" Best game of the con.<br/><br/>2016: <b>Witch: the Road to Lindesfarne</b>, wherein I played the friar, a man with a tortured soul. As I played his backstory emerged: as a young Benedictine, he had been given the responsibility to burn a witch; naturally, he was her torturer. The night before she was burned, she asked to see him. She refused to confess, but said that the child she was accused of murdering would be found near water. <br/><br/>The next day they burned her; and a week later, the body of the child was found in a well, nowhere near where the "witch" lived. And yet, she knew where the body would be found...Brother Ambrose couldn't resolve this: there was neither conclusive proof of her innocence or her guilt, and it tormented him. He became a Cistercian, and spent the trip demanding (at night--every scene I initiated was at night) that the witch confess to him. (To add to this, while in my narrated scenes I was very intense and a little unhinged, when I was in other people's scenes I made sure to keep Ambrose mostly rational and an exemplar of real Christian virtue.) In the end, Ambrose was killed trying to burn the witch, became a minor martyr forgotten by time except for the remarkable illuminated Bible he had made, dominated by an incredibly detailed image of Satan.<br/><br/>Everything clicked that night; I had a room full of great players to bounce off of, and I was able to fire on all cylinders all session. My fondest recollection of roleplaying, hands down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458728/#Comment_458728" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-16T19:27:32+00:00" title="December 16, 2016  7:27PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the session that always comes to mind for me, cut and pasted from <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/344529/#Comment_344529" rel="nofollow">this old thread</a>...\n<blockquote>My favourite DM is also my oldest friend, and he doesn't always do a lot of pre-determining, but on occasion he does, and it usually works out really well. The best example I can think of is a d20 Modern steampunk campaign he's running right now - it's a sequel to a campaign I played in a few years ago featuring some of the same characters, and so I made a cameo while visiting home as my old character. The party had travelled back in time in order to ensure that certain events happened as planned and did not disrupt the space-time continuum Back to the Future style. But the brilliant thing about it was that the whole adventure was based on a PREVIOUS adventure they had played almost ten sessions ago, so they had to make the past versions of their own characters do the things that they had already done. They had encountered my character as an NPC in the original adventure, but this time I got to play him myself, interacting with the time-travelling future versions of the party, later the same day. It was too fucking funny (and just as brain-hurting as every other time-travel story ever).<br/><br/>At the end of the original adventure, the party's aether-ship had been blown up by sabouteurs in a spectacular explosion. This event was highly traumatic for both the characters and the real-world players, as the ship had been around since the original campaign that I played in and it was essentially their home in the game-world. The party had never found the real culprits, and had since built a new, crappier version of the ship and used it to travel back in time. So, naturally, they ended up having to blow up the ship themselves for complicated macguffinny time-travel reasons - but they stole back the original, better version of the ship and blew up the new, crappier ship instead. My favourite part was the party gathering on a nearby rooftop to enjoy the explosion, and watching the shocked reactions of their past selves, which they had themselves roleplayed ten sessions ago, before sailing back to the future in their beloved original ship.<br/><br/>It wouldn't have worked without extensive GM pre-planning and railroading, but it was just glorious!</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458730/#Comment_458730" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-16T20:46:46+00:00" title="December 16, 2016  8:46PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Felan,<br/><br/>That's really cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoctimaniaGames" title="NoctimaniaGames"><img alt="NoctimaniaGames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoctimaniaGames">NoctimaniaGames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458738/#Comment_458738" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-17T15:26:12+00:00" title="December 17, 2016  3:26PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember a stand-out moment from a wargame called Lord And Legion was when I was playing my best friend Sage.

Even then there's at least as many that are only edged out by a fraction.<br/><br/>In no particular order:<br/><br/>SHADOWRUN (1st-3rd edition hodgepodge) - Inspired by the meta of the entire product line - I've talked about this one on here numerous times. It was introducing a couple people to roleplaying for the first time, and a few more to the game (they'd played a couple other things in the past). I was GM'ing. The whole thing was epic, but the final training session sticks out. <br/><br/>It was one of my favorites for several reasons - The campaign spanned the entirety of the SR product line, with a focus on meta-plot and character development. It included every general archetype of character without them being ONLY their archetypes. It was an 'us as characters' game, which has always been among my favorites. It contained an introductory novella written specifically to invest the players in their characters, the world, and the game. It included several inventions regarding teaching the game mechanics that proved at least as fun as the game itself. This all came together in that session when it went from the players playing the training, to reading the novelization of the training they'd just done, to the campaign setup reveal and finally into the initial emergence from novel to game.<br/><br/>MERP (2nd edition) - Inspired by a combination of rereading LotR and several strategy treatises - A friend ran this one for a small table (only 3 players including myself). We ended up running two characters each because of it, which I normally don't enjoy, but this time it just all worked out. The session involving the abandoned tower and small town were the pinnacle for me (with the unraveling of the canon timeline being a close second). <br/><br/>Other than just being fun in the way that you can only have in high school with friends, it was the first time I got to really play a character as myself (hyper-rational strategist and always prepared creative improvisor). My dwarf warrior got to pull some of the most epic macgyver/john wick/clausewitz in our roleplaying history. You have never seen more looks of shock and awe from a carefully prepped DM in your life. Some of the highlights were a tower cistern and room full of sharp metal bits being turned into a hydro-machinegun/caltrop distribution system, a gladiators net and collection of smithing tools used as a dwarven shotgun, a fishing net and whale oil booby-trap to confound the cavalry advantage, and a bit of simple chemistry used to sabotage the metal equipment of a small army.<br/><br/>BECMI D&amp;D - Inspired by the AD&amp;D Castle Guide and the Elenium by David Eddings - I both DM'd and played a character/npc in this small table game, something I normally try not to do. The session where my npc became squired to one of the pc's, and subsequently revealed an impossible affection for him was the jewel in that crown.<br/><br/>This one makes it for four reasons. First, it was our dedicated introduction to Mystara with all the accessories and such. It's unbelievable how great that setting really is. Second, it was a departure from AD&amp;D 1st and 2nd edition for the other couple players. I was the only one that had experienced Basic to any degree up til then. Having them learn the differences in the game versions was awesome. Third, it was the first time we'd attempted to deal with the medieval/feudal setting accurately. We got into castles, jobs, nobility, economy, intrigue, etc. Finally, it was one of the best organic evolutions of character and story I've ever experienced. Without any intent two of the characters ended up not merely as friends and knight &amp; squire, but as romantic interests as well. Given that the players of them were two heterosexual guys, to see the realness with which they treated their characters motivations and actions...it really spoke to the power of immersion.<br/><br/>LANKHMAR (AD&amp;D 2nd) - Inspired by reading both the Lankhmar novels and the Steven Brust Vlad Taltos novels - A very small game ran by me with usually one or two other players. Another where I played an NPC, due to the small party size. The session where the primary PC acquires his first bit of territory for himself.<br/><br/>So this one is all about thieving, in all of its forms. It's about the mafia-like control of a city, plots within plots, and moral ambiguity (to phrase it mildly). The session in question couldn't even be euphemised to moral ambiguity...it was a flat-out work of self-serving evil. The only other session in our gaming history that touched on that kind of viciousness was when my secretly evil Magic-User/Cleric stole all the party belongings after letting them carry most of the difficulty in a dungeon and then wiped their memories of her. It was so refreshing to play that side of the alignment compass for a change, and to do it well. Not evil for evil's sake, but just for ambition and greed.<br/><br/>STAR TREK Starship Tactical Combat Simulator - Inspired by sheer genius - This one is questionable, because there really was no 'roleplaying' to it. It's just a combat system within the FASA Star Trek RPG. But it really is one of my fondest session memories: the infamous Sensenbach maneuver.<br/><br/>The rules were simple: you have x points and one hour to spend building whatever you can using the construction manual. Then we battle royal for the crown. Each of us had our own race, and our own strategies. We each took great pride in our ship constuction. When we saw Josh had created an armada of tiny ships instead of a larger class we were curious, but fairly confident. Right up until he used his ludicrous maneuverability to fly a handful right up against each of our ships and detonate his warp drives, easily destroying us all. It remains the most obscene loophole in the rules reading I have ever fell victim to. Nothing short of sheer genius. An hour of prep, a week of anticipation, and the entire game was over in one round. Took about 90 seconds all told. Brilliant. Bastard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
