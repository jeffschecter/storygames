                    Spun off of the "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1342&amp;page=1#Item_40" rel="nofollow">I want to learn from you</a>" thread. Just so all that wasn't just a slightly embarrassing group hug, everyone who was asked about a subject, give your best answer.<br/><br/>Jonathan Walton and Warren Merrifield asked about "elegant, efficient board game design."<br/><br/>I can't say I've even scratched the surface of this craft just yet, but I have learned some habits about my own process in the course of Luchacabra's life. This is just how I do things, but it is by no means the only way to do them nor does it guarantee that you'll even make a good game. They will probably make a pretty simple game though, and an entirely unprofitable one. :P<br/><br/><b>Be Cheap</b>: Use the cheapest, most commonplace game props possible and use as few of them as possible. It's hard to make a baroque, overly complex game when you only have black and white beads on grid paper. Also, it makes distributing your game much easier when players already have the tools necessary. Look at the stuff around you right now. Examine how you can make a game out of those objects.<br/><br/><b>Forget Stuff Easily</b>: I never mastered thAC0, I barely grasp bell curve probabilities, and I absolutely suck at advanced chess techniques. Consequently, I try to write my rules so that they would fit on a sheet of paper. Even better, on a business card. Or, still better, spoken aloud in easy conversation. By definition, a game of emergent complexity needs very few rules.<br/><br/><b>Explore the Physicality of Your Game Props</b>: One way to be efficient <b>and</b>cheap is to examine your game props like Jackie Chan examines his stage props. Turn them upside down, examine how they rest in their natural state and how they group together. Can they stack? Do they make patterns? Don't forget to examine your boards too. If your board has a grid, do you play on the lines, the spaces or the vertices? Perhaps all three?<br/><br/><b>Bleed Your Props Dry</b>: How much game-information can you draw from a single prop? Take a look at the standard deck of playing cards. 52 cards. 13 cards of a particular suit. 4 cards of each rank. 26 cards in each color. A card on its own has three levels of information: Suit, Rank, and Color. Here's where exploring the physicality of the prop comes in handy, because you can also turn a card upside down. You can line them up in rows and columns. Putting them in certain combinations at random have varying levels of probability. It's this wealth of information attained from the most compact of props that has given rise to a whole galaxy of possible card games.<br/><br/><b>Learn from the Ancients</b>: In the past, no one had access to readymade miniatures, fancy boards or electronic components. They did have their household items and their imaginations, though. The game of mancala was originally played with seeds placed in little pits in the sand dug out with fingers. Go probably started when someone drew a grid in the dirt with a stick and grabbed some stones. Even Chaturanga, the Indian predecessor to Chess, Shogi and Xianqi, was based on familiar elements of Indian society at the time. Besides these superficial elements, a classic game's mechanics are often supremely efficient. Indeed, it's their elegance that made their transmission as memes so successful.                </div>

                            Rob Donaghue and Andre Kenrick asked about art and graphic design:<br/><br/>Geez, man. People spend their whole lives doing this stuff and still learn something new and exciting. <br/><br/>I can't say much about art since I don't really consider myself one. My design program was housed within the fine arts program, but we were kind of the oddballs amongst the painters, sculptors, photographers, actors, dancers and filmmakers. From my experience, art is about interpretation and expression. Design is more about communication and precise execution.<br/><br/>Much like game design, having a singular message behind your visual design is of paramount importance. The artifact â€” be it a book cover, a poster, or a character sheet â€” is only the conduit through which you transmit this message with as high a fidelity as possible.<br/><br/>Here's what I recently told a client when we were discussing the cover of their game:
<blockquote>...if you are going to have a person on the cover, make it someone a player wants to <i>be</i> or someone the player wants to <b>meet</b>. (Preferably the former.) ...<br/><br/>I admit I've only been doing designing professionally for a couple years, but I've learned a lot in that short time. The most important lesson is that a cover isn't a synopsis of the book's setting. It's not even necessarily a cool scene or a collection of standard characters you can play. <br/><br/>A cover is a <b>promise</b>. <br/><br/>Will I be a gorilla flying a biplane while fighting off Rosie the Riveter and the Rocketeer like<br/>on the cover of <i>Spirit of the Century</i>? Will I meet serene, unbelievably pure beings like the statue on the cover of <i>Nobilis</i>?<br/><br/>What you put on the cover is what you're <i>promising</i> that your players will experience when they<br/>play your game. ... </blockquote>
I prattled on quite a bit in that email, quite like the insolent rookie that I am. (Since that email, I've realized that a <i>brand</i> is a promise. But that's for another post some day.) I really am still learning a lot about the skill of designing and what it can do. I like to keep up with design-oriented sites like:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lifeclever.com/" rel="nofollow">Lifeclever</a><br/><a href="http://infosthetics.com/" rel="nofollow">Information Aesthetics</a><br/><a href="http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/" rel="nofollow">Visual Complexity</a><br/><a href="http://www.typographi.com/" rel="nofollow">Typographica</a><br/><a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/" rel="nofollow">Lifehacker</a><br/><a href="http://www.bamagazine.com/" rel="nofollow">Before &amp; After Magazine</a><br/><a href="http://www.designobserver.com/" rel="nofollow">Design Observer</a><br/><a href="http://www.slackermanager.com/" rel="nofollow">Slacker Manager</a><br/><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/" rel="nofollow">Boxes and Arrows</a><br/><a href="http://v-2.org/" rel="nofollow">Adam Greenfield's V2</a><br/><a href="http://www.43folders.com/" rel="nofollow">43 Folders</a><br/><br/>Some of these are new to my bookmarks so I haven't had a chance to explore them much. I have all these sites in a firefox bookmark folder labeled "design blogs." Every morning when I get into the office a little early, I go to that folder and choose "Open in Tabs" which brings up all those sites in separate tabs in the same window. It's not quite an RSS feed, but I like reading posts in their original blog's context. I read those sites while I eat some oatmeal, just to get a bearing on where design is at the moment.<br/><br/>Besides all this, I'd suggest checking out magazines like Communication Arts, How, Readymade, and Print. Find a designer that you really like, outside of gaming or fandom, and bring those techniques into your circle. (For example, Monte Cook studied the information design of travel guidebooks when he built the massively indexed <i>Ptolus</i>.) <br/><br/>Also, if you're truly passionate about the subject, <b>go to school</b>. I can't emphasize it enough. I think most people here are already past college age, so I'd suggest finding quality night classes if possible. Make sure that the classes aren't merely "how to use photoshop" or other technical courses, but truly teach you about <i>design</i>. It's very, very hard, but I'm not exaggerating when I say that it completely changes how you experience the world.                        </div>

                            Shreyas, you asked about clear presentation online:<br/><br/>1. Paragraphs should be no more than 5 sentences.  If you have a complex sentence, try to break it out or cut up the paragraph.<br/><br/>2.  Try to reread your posts before hitting submit.  Sometimes, I'll just leave the window open and surf and read something else and re-read it and see if it makes sense to me. <br/><br/>3.  Break things out into points (like I'm doing right now).  It helps keep them from running together and makes them "bite sized" and digestible.  Also consider using titles to break up sections in posts longer than 4-5 paragraphs.<br/><br/>4.  Emphasis can be made in by italics, bold, parentheses, etc.  Try not to use this more than 3 times in a post, as it can get tiresome quick.  Using different types, such as -dashes- can help keep that from irritating people.  Use bolding rarely, or as titles, it often reads as all caps shouting.<br/><br/>5.  Consider giving a single sentence it's own paragraph, especially if it is a key point to the post.<br/><br/>6.  Make sure side points don't overwhelm the primary point.  It's an easy trap to fall into given the common use of straw man argumentation and nitpicking of the net.   <br/><br/>7.  For long posts, summarise at the end, preferably in 3 sentences or less.<br/><br/>8.  Also consider breaking up long posts into seperate posts, especially if you're blog writing, as opposed to forum writing.  People often need time to digest and dialogue about certain ideas before they're ready for the next one.                        </div>

                            JWalt asked wants to know how to "make historical settings drip with authenticity".  I think there's a good discussion of this going on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1419" rel="nofollow">in another thread</a>, but some thoughts on this.<br/><br/>I <em>consume</em> a time and place I'm interested in.  For Grey Ranks that means reading the obvious reference books, but also poring over the 1939 Warsaw telephone directory to get a feel for the life of the city, watching any barely relevant film, reading fiction and personal narratives, making personal contacts.  This more or less requires access to a research-one university library and the time to bumble around in it, or having a very good relationship with your patient local ILL librarian.  This process was more or less the same for the Roach (I'd done a lot of this work ahead of time for other gaming projects focusing on the Edwardian era, so most of my actual work involved tracking down public domain art sources - in that case, I literally pawed through hundreds of pre-1922 books in likely LC categories looking for illustrations).  It probably goes without saying that you have to love both the process and the subject for this to work.                        </div>

                            Warren asked about sexy-ass book design.<br/><br/>Step one: <b>Don't assume you know anything.</b> There are brilliant masters in this field that have come before us. Study them. Copy them. Go to the bookstore and look at the covers that make you want to pick up the book. Look at the interiors of books. See how there's a certain consistency of design there? Type just *works* in certain ways. If you're going to do something wacky, you need to have a very good reason. Be an empty vessel. You know nothing. Look at good design (that is, design that appeals to you) and copy, copy, copy.<br/><br/>Step two: <b>Get some book learnin'.</b> Robert Bringhurst's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Typographic_Style" rel="nofollow"><i>The Elements of Typographic Style</i></a> is a really good course in book design. He is not the final word on the subject, of course, but he's a really good place to start. Like I said, if you break the rules you need a good reason. Bringhurst's book could be considered "the rules."<br/><br/><a href="http://www.goodisdead.com/" rel="nofollow">Chip Kidd</a> designed your favorite book cover. Seriously. He's the living master of this art form, and his work has many lessons to teach.<br/><br/>Frank Miller and Mike Mignola work with great book designers for their trade paperbacks and collections. The covers and interior designs are always really good. The Sin City books in particular have very captivating cover design.<br/><br/>I could go on and on. This is another of those topics that people spend a lifetime trying to master.

                            I feel like I'm just beginning to feel like I have something to say about these issues but here goes.<br/><br/>For <b>John Harper</b> ("practical game design wisdom from the more avant-garde folks"):<br/><br/>Ah, those avant-garde folks.  Ever so practical <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Seriously, I think there IS a big difference between doing things for the sheer punk-rock joy of iconoclasm and trying to innovate in a way that actually creates awesome play. The first can be worth stealing ideas from, but the latter is what really gets me going.<br/><br/>I think it really starts with choosing a concept that would be impossible to do as a traditional roleplaying game. Find something that'll push you in previously unexplored directions and then don't compromise on being true to that concept.  Like, if you decide that you want create a game that emulates the kind of "talk and walk" TV shows pioneered by Aaron Sorking (West Wing, Sports Night), you're not going to define characters by their physical or mental capabilities (duh), you're gonna have to figure out how to encourage the brainy banter thing (the talk) as well as the constant motion (the walk), and you're gonna need to find ways to create drama that are not simply about conflicts between characters, but also about working toward solutions to complex problems.  Not an easy task.  You're gonna have to invent stuff along the way that has never been seen in roleplaying before.  But that's part of your job.  If you design a game based on a concept that already "would make great RPG!"... you're (primarily) adapting the material to the medium, instead of (primarily) expanding the medium to handle the material. Both of these can be worthwhile projects, but the latter focuses on pushing roleplaying further, and that gets extra bonus points in my book.<br/><br/>As far as actual design goes, I get most of my inspiration by trying to enact theories I have about roleplaying, usually ones that I've developed while doing reading about other narrative mediums: literature, storytelling, history, film, theatre, opera, epic poetry, and the like. They've been around a lot longer than roleplaying and a lot of smart people have written a lot of smart things about them.<br/><br/>Also, and I can't emphasize this enough, find someone who will challenge you to not settle for the easy solutions. I talk to Shreyas and Ben and Thomas on a fairly regular basis.  Often I'll be really excited about something and they'll go "yawn." And then I'll make something even better.  And they'll go "That's okay I guess..." And I'll be forced to try even harder. Find people who won't be impressed by your ideas. Otherwise, you risk being surrounded by Yes Men. You also need to find people who will be willing to think critically about stuff that's hella weird and may take a while to really understand, people who are willing to make an investment in you as a designer, even if the results may be a while in coming.  That's probably true nomatter what you're designing.<br/><br/>For <b>Neek Krishnaswami</b> ("what structured freeform is and how to do it"):<br/><br/>Ha. Dude, I barely know. I think it's about creating guidelines for what players can narrate, ones based on storytelling and characterization principles instead of rolling dice or comparing things. There have been hints of this in a lot of indie games, from the screen presence stuff in <i>Primetime Adventures</i> to the different kinds of scenes described in <i>Burning Empires</i> to the way Keys guide character behavior in <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> to the way the "we owe" list helps structure scenes in <i>AG&amp;G</i> (these are just some of the more recent examples). Up until now, though, these kinds of mechanics have been grafted onto fairly traditional engines. I'm interested in games that are composed solely of these kinds of guidelines, instead of mixing them in with more traditional mechanics. And I think we have the tools to create those now.                        </div>

                            Thanks, Jonathan. I think I understand why I'm so interested by what you're doing now. <br/><br/>So, there's this thing called "overjustification" or "undermining". The idea is that if you have someone who does something for some internal reason, and then you give them an extrinsic reward (like money), then the extrinsic reward will tend to displace the internal reason as the person's motivation. This is just a fancy name for something we all know, but the curious thing is that this effect is <em>stronger</em> with weak extrinsic rewards rather than large ones. If we have a Democrat, and she accepts a million bucks to read an essay praising George W. Bush out loud, then it's easy for her to figure out that she's just doing it for the money. But if she took 25 cents to praise him, then the idea she's doing it for the money is hard to believe, and to avoid cognitive dissonance she'll tend to start believing what she read out loud. <br/><br/>Now, when you look at rpgs, almost all of them have this external reward system, like experience or high stats and things like that. And we're also supposed to care about story, which is an intrinsic motivation. So the potential for overjustification rears its head. Worse still, experience points are nearly meaningless in and of themselves, so they are a <em>weak</em> extrinsic motivation. So it seems like we have a really big danger of replacing the intrinsic motivation -- pleasure in story and character -- and replacing it with the grind (as the MMORPGers say). <br/><br/>So when you talk about building systems where the intrinsic reward is the core of the game's reward cycle, I'm all ears.                        </div>

                            Totally, Neel.  Which is why I was a little weirded out when I posted the 'key chains' stuff and Mike Holmes was like "where's the reward system?"  I don't think you really need one.<br/><br/>There are significant obstacles. Sunday night we ran my <i>Exalted</i> hack again and we were all sorta expecting the conflict guidelines to help move the conflict towards resolution, since that's something we normally expect from conflict rules. Really, we were just waiting for one of the characters to do something decisive, so the scene could end.  Sometimes, when you're used to the system doing things for you, it's hard to switch out of that mode.  We're still searching for a comfortable mix of freeform and more traditional mechanics, but part of it may just be us getting used to playing this way, really drawing on our own skills at telling stories, instead of assuming the system will make us look good no matter what we do.                        </div>

                            Troy Costick and Rob Donoghue both asked me about Art. Troy specifically about networking with affordable artists and Rob mentioned me in a big list of Art &amp; Graphic Design people he'd like to learn from.<br/><br/>NOTE: I am not addressing finding your art in the public domain. There are many people here who would be better equipped to handling a discussion of that. I am specifically talking about hiring an artist to illustrate your book.<br/><br/>This is a big subject that I think will be fruitful for both designers and artists if there is more, and open, communication. I can't possibly cover everything, but here are my Big Thoughts.<br/><br/>1. Networking with artists is a fairly simple task. Find an artist you like and offer them a project they're interested in. Treat them as professionals, respect their work, and be open and honest with your praise and criticism on the project. Build a relationship with every artist you work with, and don't burn bridges. Ask them if there are artists they like who might interested in a project. Artists are like all other people and like to be praised (honestly) and involved in projects people are excited about.<br/><br/>2. As far as affordability, this ties into 'treat them like professionals'. Be up front about the money you're offering. If you want to pay $100 for a dozen illustrations you're going to get bottom-of-the-barrel talent (or me), either in terms of reliability or quality or both. A good artist is going to spend between 5 and 10 hours on EACH PIECE of your art. Instead of looking for 'affordable artists' you should be looking at how much good art you can afford with your budget.<br/><br/>3. Accept that you won't be able to afford some artists. If you make an offer, and it's refused, politely say that you hope to work with the artist in the future. but that you cannot afford them with your current budget. If you make an enquiry, and their price is too high, do the same. Build good relationships with people even if you don't work with them. It means that you may be able to work with them in the future.<br/><br/>4. Do more with less art. Find the places where art is needed, or will illustrate a piece of the text well, or where there are breaks where it makes sense for art to go. Think about why you want art, and what will go best with your book. I'd love to see more books with cool, thought-out dingbats, or solely nice, big full-page chapter illustrations, or other very specific forms of illustrations that allow the art to improve the reading experience instead of distracting from it. Do not have art just because it's what RPGs have.<br/><br/>5. Break what's accepted as normal. Many, many indie games already do this, but I'd like to see it go even further. Do the research, go to the library, find the style you want your game to embrace or modify. Unify your design and art into a streamlined package. Explore artists who have strong voices that will complement your work. Their anatomy and perspective may not be perfect, but your book will be a unique and beautiful piece if you embrace their personality as an aspect of the design. All RPG art does not have to follow the same rules.<br/><br/>6. If you don't know much about art, talk to people who do. Even if you disagree with them, it can sharpen your own opinions.<br/><br/>Finally, and this is shameless, I know, I am available as an art director. I've got a competent group of artists I've worked with, and with the right project, I can expand that circle. I love to talk about art, and I love exploring different ways of approaching illustration and design, and I think I'm pretty good at talking to and working with artists. I sure enjoy it a lot.                        </div>

                            Remi speaks wise, like an art-owl.  If you need an endorsement from a designer who has worked with him, I'll endorse him to within an inch of his life.  Also - figure out how you'll be using the work and absolutely spell it out, in terms of what rights are retained, and by whom, and who gets paid what and when, and who provides what, at what resolution, by what date.  This is something he has taught me, and I have seen him deal with artists, and he knows how to talk to them in the arcane argot  they understand and Get Things Done.                        </div>

                            Thanks, Jason. I didn't talk that much about specific ways to handle a project, but just making sure everyone's on the same page concerning the details is an important part of treating your project and artists with the respect they deserve. Clear guidelines help everyone's peace of mind.                        </div>
