My requirements were:<br/><br/>1. It had to be easy to use and intuitive: I didn't want the process of using the program to get in the way of my ideas.  If that meant sacrificing options for the sake of simplicity and ease of use, so be it.<br/><br/>2. I wanted it to be local, not a tool I can only use while connected to the web.<br/><br/>3.  The data needs to be exportable; I didn't want my data locked into a proprietary format only usable by the origination program.<br/><br/>4. Mac OS X compatible.  You can take my Mac Book Pro out of my cold, dead hands.<br/><br/>5. It should be low-cost or free.  I don't mind paying for software but I can't really justify paying $100+ for a program I know I wouldn't use a lot.<br/><br/>Result:<br/><br/>I found C-Map which is far from perfect but excellent in other ways and certainly fulfills my five requirements. (and, yep, it's free)<br/><br/>Link here: <a href="http://cmap.ihmc.us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cmap.ihmc.us/</a><br/><br/>I hope this helps anyone looking for a similar product.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TanRu" title="TanRu"><img alt="TanRu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.planetofthegeeks.com/images/zombietimmy.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TanRu">TanRu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117015/#Comment_117015" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-29T12:56:00+00:00" title="December 29, 2007 12:56PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oo this is pretty cool!

I've looked at the three programs you mention and, for one or more of my five reasons, C-Map tops them (for me, of course).  I found Freemind's interface too cluttered and not intuitive and Graphviz wasn't graphical at all when entering data (which didn't work for me) though I will say that Graphviz is amazingly complete; I've put together some very nice R-Maps with Graphviz but it felt a bit like a struggle.  C-Map just works better for the way I think and work.  Omnigraffle is a great program but I didn't want to spend the money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117044/#Comment_117044" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-29T19:39:42+00:00" title="December 29, 2007  7:39PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Noble</cite>I found C-Map which is far from perfect but excellent in other ways and certainly fulfills my five requirements.

Very easy to use with lots of clickies and draggies (and no swf's or xml source data). Thanks Noble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
