Therefore any given character has five promotion opportunities.<br/><br/>Therefore the highest rank any character can achieve in the game, assuming he makes every Development roll, is Colonel (rank 7).<br/><br/>The Field Promotion rules exacerbate this, as they're currently written. The only way to get a Field Promotion is when a PC officer dies; the next-highest PC takes that rank. So you can't even put a bullet in the NPC Brigadier's head and take the job.<br/><br/>And finally, under the Replacement rules you do get a fresh Strength -- but you also get demoted (at least) one Rank. So that's (at least) a zero-sum gambit.<br/><br/>Is there some way to achieve Brigadier I've overlooked? If the answer is "GM Fiat," I'll be deeply disappointed.<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167942/#Comment_167942" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T08:56:39+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  8:56AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will let some of the (more) devious bastards of the forum point out how they plan on doing it.<br/><br/>Starting at Corporal seems the method-du-jour...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167967/#Comment_167967" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T10:12:17+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 10:12AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You'll likely have to die, of course, to get your strength back.

Simply off them once they've wasted their strengths to achieve promotion.  <br/><br/>I actually love the fact that there must be at least a death or two to get that high of rank, it ensures brutality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167982/#Comment_167982" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T10:52:57+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 10:52AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted this to someone else, and I figured I'll put it here too (in case I'm too coy).<br/><br/>-----<br/>To get to Brigadier is deliberately incredibly hard. Mechanically you want to start below the Sergeant and get Field Promoted at some point to a rank above Sergeant. Then you have enough Strengths to reach Brigadier by Development Rolls. Even in that case you have to explain how the post has become available. An option is to get to Colonel and use a Strength, say, to replace the Brigadier. I doubt it will occur in play unless there is some strong collusion from a group to make it happen.<br/>-----<br/><br/>(Or technically you could be Sergeant and hand around waiting for someone to become Captain and then get field promoted there directly before using your first Strength.)<br/><br/>In some ways I think it is an impossible goal. Mechanically possible, enough that it might one day happen, but in such remote circumstances as to be nothing to worry about for anyone playing the game (yet, it is still there in the background). However, knowing gamers, some people will shoot for it as a target -- so I made it that you could not just devour your way to the top by seeking promotion at every turn and achieve it. Certainly not without having to use a Weakness, or have one forced upon you by the rest of the group, and then having to deal with the fictional consequences of what that entailed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167987/#Comment_167987" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T11:09:10+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 11:09AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay.

You will have at _worst_ an NFA of 9 at that point, and I very much assume it will be 10.<br/><br/>If someone has a Colonel, and a Strength available, then I'm quite sure they will envisage asking for a private meeting with the Brigadier and the inner cadre of Colonels to discuss how the battle is going on Planet Warhol, or wherever. A bloodless coup might result from the PC winning a PC vs NPC conflict with the Brigadier, but if they had a Strength then it will work out for them however they like since they will win a conflict with the Brigadier in a manner of their choosing.<br/><br/>If, in the fiction, the PC is still only the "acting" Brigadier or whatever then their promotion will be confirmed between Missions when they make their Development Roll (as the rest of the Colonels fall into line with the NFA 10 will of the PC). And I'm not sure whether I should recommend the new Brigadier leaving any Weaknesses for their character at that point given that it's a vulnerability, but also a way of losing on your own terms.<br/><br/>Who knows? That will turn out in play if anyone ever gets there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
