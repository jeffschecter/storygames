Namely, special abilities.<br/><br/>In a Kung Fu game, you need special abilities.  Whether it\u2019s your \u201cMighty Iron Fist Kung Fu,\u201d or your \u201cFury of Nine Tigers Technique,\u201d you gotta have them.  That\u2019s a fun, awesome thing about kung fu.  (It\u2019s something that both Exalted and Weapons of the Gods do totally totally right.)<br/><br/>In a hard core crunchy gamist-angled game, you need special abilities, so people can choose from a shopping list and customize their characters for awesome effectiveness, and make combats interesting and different.  (The success of the previously name-dropped games in this application is debatable, with points both pro and con.)<br/><br/>Anyway, writing up lists and lists of special abilities is hard.  There\u2019s a lot of them, they have to be balanced, and for me, the biggest barrier is knowing where to begin.  Everytime I\u2019ve tried to write such a game, I\u2019ve pretty much given up in the anxious terror of inertia.  That\u2019s why writing Awesome Adventures was so helpful for me; it\u2019s a lighter game, so I could get straight to the writing and figure out a thing or two about wrting games.<br/><br/>Anyway, what I figured out I needed to do is organize the abilities better.  I came up with ten categories while pondering this.  So instead of having to come up with, say, thirty different abilities out of the blue, I only have to come up with three for each category.  And I find that now I\u2019m thinking about it like this, categorically, I\u2019m having a lot more inspiration, and the ideas are coming to me easier.<br/><br/>So the benefit to me, as a designer, is that it compartamentalizes my design, and breaks up the huge task into smaller, easily handled tasks.  This is an amazingly good thing.<br/><br/>Also, I\u2019m hoping that there will be a benefit here in play, since these categories correspond to character play niches.  If one wants to play a mook destroyer, taking out hordes of lesser enemies, one needs only to look at the Crowd Control martial styles, rather than digging through the description of every single ability to see if it\u2019s useful or not.  I hope this will be a play advantage over the previously mentioned games.<br/><br/>Anyway, here\u2019s the ten categories:<br/><br/>Offensive:  Focuses on boosting damage and attack rolls, making sure your attacks are successful and potent.<br/><br/>Defensive:  Focuses on boosting defense rolls and withstanding damage, resisiting enemy attacks, and staying in the fight.<br/><br/>Crowd Control:  Attacks focusing on dealing with mooks and hordes of lesser enemies.<br/><br/>Area Control:  Focuses on moving enemeis or preventing their movement, and aiding the battle on a strategic level.<br/><br/>Support:  Abilities that increase one\u2019s own capabilities or improve the abilities of others.  Buffing.  Possibly includes Chi management.<br/><br/>Recovery: Mid battle healing, minimize effects of enemy attacks.<br/><br/>Interference:  Debuffs.  Abilities that hinder enemies and impede their ability to act effectively.<br/><br/>Denial:  Focuses on negating the effects of enemy techniques and stles, possibly draining enemy chi or negating enemy buffs.<br/><br/>Utility:  Tricks, magical spells, with a primary focus on non-combat applications, but with possible combat benefits.<br/><br/>Movement: Focuses on allowing the character to quickly move between areas and get to (or away from) the fight.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125980/#Comment_125980" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T11:23:40+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 11:23AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            so useful                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125989/#Comment_125989" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T12:08:29+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 12:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been developing this "archtypical" system for martial arts based on the Classical Elements.<br/><br/><b><span style="color: #aa0000;">Fire:</span></b> <i>Fire burns, consumes, extends.</i> Techniques that focus on damaging and disabling the opponent.<br/><i>Offensive:</i> You try to cause as much extended damage as possible with every single strike. You do not concern yourself about your own injuries, since you don't care much about pain. In fact you have learned to loose yourself in battle, following only your instincts. You have learned to disable and injure your rival, so his attacks become less effective. Typical attacks include using your knees, elbows, knuckles, chi attacks...<br/><i>Defensive:</i> You try to block your enemy in a way that every attack weakens and damages him. Hitting you becomes like trying to grab a red-hot coil. You know how to use your own defenses to disable him. Typical defenses include stopping kicks with other kicks or with your elbows, using your opponent's own momentum and strength against himself, using your chi to damage someone grappling you...<br/><br/><b><span style="color: #0000FF;">Water:</span></b> <i>As cold as the peaceful pond, as dangerous as the wild storm.</i> Techniques that focus on reflection, wit and adaptability.<br/><i>Offensive:</i> You try to inflict precise and controlled attacks, gaining strength and speed through momentum. You know when to hit and how, and learn to wait until the very best moment to do so. Typical attacks include counterattacks, hits with your palms and graceful, dance like movements...<br/><i>Defensive:</i> You adapt to your opponent's movement. You move with him, feel like him, think like him. You anticipate his movements and use the best and most efficient approach to defend from him. Typical defenses include defensive throws, circular and precise motions, counter-attack like defenses...<br/><br/><b><span style="color: #996633;">Earth:</span> </b><i>Nothing moves you. Nothing damages you. Nothing distracts you.</i> Techniques that rely on stability, brute force and concentration.<br/><i>Offensive:</i> You try to use all your might in every single attack. Some even say the perfect technique would be the one able to knock out an opponent with a single hit. There is no defense against your attacks; if they don't want to feel the pain, they can only evade your hits. Typical attacks include strong, heavy and direct kicks and punches, headbutts, tackles, slams...<br/><i>Defensive:</i> Your defense is unbreakable, your body seems impervious to pain. Moving you is like moving a mountain. Distracting you is like distracting a statue. You are the paragon of balance, tranquility and might. Typical defenses short, powerful blocks, focused appliances of strength at the right time, and even no defense at all (practitioners of this style learn to deal with the pain and minimize the damage from any attack)...<br/><br/><b><span style="color: #66dddd;">Air:</span></b> <i>You cannot hit what is not there.</i> Techniques based on movement, flexibility and speed. Masters of aerial combat.<br/><i>Offensive:</i> You have learned that strong attacks mean nothing if they are unable to land. Thus you focus on hitting your enemy as much and as many times as you can. You tire him, you waste him, you defeat him. Speed is the key, confusion and frustration your allies. Typical attacks include quick and short attacks, swift precise touches, surprise throws and staves, flying kicks...<br/><i>Defensive:</i> Your best defense is to never get hit. You have maximized your speed and agility, and with lightning reflexes you are able to avoid practically all attacks. Stay away from your opponent's reach, since your speed would allow you to get him in your own and get away again before he can react. Typical defenses include last second dodges, quick jumps, bouncing on the arena, staying out of your enemy's reach...<br/><br/>Note that, as with any archtypical system, they are not absolute extremes. One warrior can develop a balanced style using the best parts of every system, or he can complement the weaknesses of his own technique with some knowledge of the opposite one. One can even switch from one style to another one in the middle of the battle.<br/><br/>And remember. We are talking about Far East philosophies. Ying-yang. The True Master knows it is better to complement his training with different disciplines, and that only the fool focus completely on one single, vulnerable technique. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses, and it is best to study each one with care.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125992/#Comment_125992" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T12:19:16+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 12:19PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willow,<br/><br/>The thing I like best about what you've done, is you've examined what people do during actual play and turned their actions into mechanics.  That's awesome.  Everyone knows in Gamist-crunchy games, you gotta have Offense, Defense, and Movement.  And usually, that's all the gets attention.  But what you know, and a good number of people know vaguely in the backs of their heads, is that SO much more goes on during the course of a game that Gamists find fun that does not necessary have to be tied to Offense, Defense, and Movement.

Like Troy said, they are clearly based on what players do, which is fantastic. I'm curious about designer process though. I wonder if you started off with more or fewer, and how you arrived at the set you have now. Sometimes it's really illuminating to see how a designer edits and expands a concept to arrive at a working form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126000/#Comment_126000" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T12:41:37+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 12:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tristan-<br/><br/>Those elements are neat.  Each one has it's own flavor and Special trappings, which are cool.  However, if each style has an offensive and a defensive benefit, why branch out?<br/><br/>Warriors uses elements too.  Here's how they work-<br/><br/>Earth is the Principle of Stability.  Earth determines your health, and is rolled to resist Social fu and certain techniques.<br/><br/>Fire is the Principle of Passion.  Fire gives one Passion Points, which can be spent to re-roll dice rolls.  It's also the primary social ability.<br/><br/>Metal is the Principle of Skill.  Metal is rolled for attack rolls in combat.<br/><br/>Water is the Principle of Movement.  It determines how fast you move, and what kind of tricky manevers you can pull off.<br/><br/>Wood is the Principle of Vitality.  It is rolled for defense in combat.  It's also the spellcasting stat (for non-combat spellcasting.)<br/><br/>Now, you'll note that all of these interact meaningfully with combat.  I'm also not trying to fit them into my ten categories.<br/><br/>So your Elements are your Stats.  (There aren't any Skills.  If it's not Combat, Social Fu, or Magic, it's not important enough to have a detailed resolution system.)  Styles and Techniques (which are grouped into my ten categories) are your Feats &amp; Spells &amp; Charms &amp; What Have You.<br/><br/>Troy-<br/><br/>Yup.  When I wrote <a href="http://willowrants.wordpress.com/2006/09/20/on-maneuvers/" rel="nofollow">On Maneuvers</a> I think I boiled combat actions down to their atomic parts.  And you're right, Attack, Defense, and Move are where all the attention is.  But Maneuvers are where the cool stuff is at.  Area Control, Support, Denial, Interference, and Utility all fall into that Maneuver category, but they're different enough in form and play that they deserve their own attention and awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126009/#Comment_126009" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T12:51:11+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 12:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey John-<br/><br/>This all started with me reading about D&amp;D 4th edition, and someone saying that some of the classes are designed towards a certain end.  Now, I don't want Warriors to have classes, but designing abilities towards a certain end is a good idea.  So I started pondering what those ends were.<br/><br/>I also thought about MMORPGs and the solo RPG Mass Effect.  Most MMORPGs have a very shared jargon, which Mass Effect also has.  So when you talk about AoE, DoT, Buffs, and Debuffs, people know what you're talking about, even if they play WoW and I play Guild Wars.<br/><br/>So, I was thinking about this while working at my job, without access to anything to write down, so it kind of expanded and contracted in my mind, then I went to break and wrote down what I had.  I typed them up in the order I thought of them.<br/><br/>Obviously, there's nothing definitive about these categories.  Crowd Control and Offensive have the same ends- kill people- but since crowds of mooks and single opponents are key, I felt it needed a level of distinction.  Another game designer might feel that manipulation of resources (perhaps, say, spell mana points) deserves its own level of distinction for a given game.  (Energy Management is certainly a skill role in Guild Wars strategy discourse).  These are all roles though I can easily and readily see people wanting to play, although Area Control, Support, Interference, and Denial may be more esoteric.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126015/#Comment_126015" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T12:57:43+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 12:57PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry if this seems a dumb question, but continuing the MMOG analogy, what about pets ?

You group spells into thematic groups (elements, schools, zodiac signs, whatever) and levels, and that breaks down what you actually need to write into small and manageable chunks; and most importantly focussed and purposeful ones.<br/><br/>Based on that experience I would say that a tightly categorized system can suffer from certain core abilities that everyone would want to have being in only one category, and thus rather messing things up for the characters.

Look at D&amp;D's spell schools.  If you picked a random necromancy spell, could you tell before hand what it's supposed to do?  Sure, something about the dead, but it might gather information, or use negative energy to attack people, or protect you from undead.<br/><br/>Instead, I'm looking at things from the mechanical level.  Once I've got this, I can decide where my "Fire Fist Kung Fu" or whatever needs to go.<br/><br/>If all your cool offensive spells are affiliated with Aries, and it's not supposed to be like that, and all your offensive casters are Aries, you might have a problem.  If all your cool offensive spells are associated with "Offense," then you've probably done your job right.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126032/#Comment_126032" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T13:13:54+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  1:13PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hituro - To Willow's point, I don't think these categories are meant to be balanced schools with equal contents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126033/#Comment_126033" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T13:16:55+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  1:16PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elements as Stats...

Meanwhile, for <a href="http://glasscutters.org" rel="nofollow">GLASS</a>, I took the perspective of what the minimum "capacities and resources" (Attributes, which also serve as "Hit Points", "Mana," and "Sanity Points") comprise a character and then made my Ability list by thinking of every way in which a character or "the world" (setting) could interact with--or be acted upon by--those resources.<br/><br/>Her method reflect the tabletop world where everything is imagined and so anything is possible, and a designer tries to balance handling time against verisimilitude. But GLASS, being for LARP, has to deal with real-world, physical actions by players and those players' real limitations, and adjust desiggn focus accordingly. Further, the immediacy and real-time nature of LARP necessitates fairly simple systems (ergo, I only have three resource pools/stats; I don't justify duplicate effects with minor, nuanced differences; and all complexity of Ability creation is front-loaded prior to play).<br/><br/>Not trying to derail; just pointing out yet-another way in which play mode and design priorities directly impact system elements and levels of detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126192/#Comment_126192" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T10:09:50+00:00" title="February 13, 2008 10:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conceptually I really like it.

An Interference technique might be something that slows them down, giving them a penalty to rolls.  A Denial technique would stop their technique from ever happening (like counterspells in Magic).  I think Denial is going to be rarer and costlier than Interference.  The two are very similar, but I felt I wanted a level of distinction.<br><br/>It may be my experience as a board gamer talking, but Area Control is a quite different animal than just impeding your enemies.  If you're a big tough guy with a big club and an Earthquake Invoking Technique and your enemies can't get past you to your healer and mystic laser shooter, you aren't so much penalizing your enemies as you are forcing them to attack you (instead of a more prefential target.)  On the flipside, maybe you use your magic to summon an Auspicious Traveling Wind that allows your allies to move more quickly from area to area- this could be considered a Support style, but I'm grouping it here, because I want people to think about manipulating the battlefield as a whole as a play strategy.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126315/#Comment_126315" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T16:19:48+00:00" title="February 13, 2008  4:19PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice one Willow, this is really good, the abilities and the elements together would be lush, and I like Ryan's deck of cards foe skilll generator thingy too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126328/#Comment_126328" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T17:09:54+00:00" title="February 13, 2008  5:09PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there is one area you are missing.... that of Sensing.
