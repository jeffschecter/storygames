                    Once upon a time people sitting at an rpg table kind of expected to deal with a gargantuan rules system with tons of crunch. Anything shy of that would have been considered light and agile and a breeze to play.<br/><br/>Nowadays with the existence of minimal games that, with very few mechanics, are able to deliver deep and complex stories and experiences, the expectation has shifted. Especially in the universe of games with an emergent plot.<br/><br/>And so it happened that I ended up having a few discussions about how the core resolution mechanic of Fate (be it <i>Core</i> or <i>Accelerated</i> and even <i>FateLess</i>) was perceived by the paople talking to me as too heavy, too complicated, too slow, almost in the way of the story.<br/>"<i>The story is great, but whenever we roll dice, meh!</i>"<br/>The example they made to me is as follows...<br/><br/>Let's compare two different games we could nonetheless put in the medium-heavy area of the crunch spectrum. <b><i>Fate Core</i></b> and <b><i>Apocalypse World</i></b>.<br/><br/>In Apocalypse World the Player's description would trigger a resolution moment (aka: a move). What'll happen is that usually there will be a dice roll or some other specific thing as prescribed by the specific move. This would determine an outcome. Someone would describe it. And the game/story/fiction would move on from there.<br/>Mind not that to resolve a single situation you often spend a <b>lot</b> of time performing a <b>lot</b> of not-so-decisive moves.<br/>What people told me they <b>perceive</b>, what they <b>feel</b>, is that all of this move-doing is smooth sailing. It's simple. It's easy. It's somehow <b>concrete and solid</b>, thus logical.<br/>Description -&gt; roll -&gt; outcome -&gt; description -&gt; etc.<br/>Whether you succeed, or fail.<br/><br/>Compare this to Fate.<br/>The Player's description would trigger a resolution moment.<br/>This could mean any of 3 different resolution structures (Challenge, Contest, Conflict)<br/>In each of those, you could opt to perform any of 4 types of action (Cr.Advantage, Overcome, Attack, Defense<br/>Eventually you get to roll.<br/>Let's say you roll poorly and get a negative outcome.<br/>But wait, you  could spend Fate to roll again... and to do so you have to highlight/modify (ever so slightly) the fiction by invoking an Aspect.<br/>But wait, maybe it's not enough so you can spend another Fate on another Aspect.<br/>But wait, your opposition maybe Invokes Aspects of their own and now your score is not enough anymore, do you spend more of your Fate? Do you have any more relevant and unspent Aspects?<br/>Eventually you get a final outcome.<br/>But wait, maybe you would accept to succeed anyway with a serious cost.<br/>Finally the outcome is clear, and the results get narrated into the story, that can finally move on.<br/><br/>And this could happen for every single test within a longer Contest/Conflict.<br/>This, they say, feels complex, convoluted, slow, and very <b>abstract</b>.<br/><br/>Now, the discussion I had was not even about Fate. It was about FateLess which compared to Fate Core or even Fate Accelerated is like a small feather. Still, it keeps the original fundamental structure:<br/>- trigger<br/>- roll<br/><b>- invoke?</b><br/>- outcome<br/><b>- accept cost?</b><br/>- final outcome<br/><br/>And there, as in Fate, the Invoke part could get quite inflated, and even more so if you are facing off against another PC doing their own invokes.<br/><br/>And... nothing... it got me thinking.<br/>Is such structure truly conductive to fiction-first narrative-emergent gameplay?<br/>I never had a problem with it. And know tons of people who also don't have a problem with it.<br/>Hearing this critique, from different people, in different occasions, all in just a short time span ... it's making me doubt my assumptions.<br/><br/>Is the Fate basic structure truly this much cumbersome and almost "in the way" of an emergent story?<br/>Am I unable to see it out of mere habit?<br/>Or is it just a matter of personal taste? Of having played so much variations of PbtA that now anything actually different feels uncomfortable?                </div>

                            Hmmm, I think that if people forget to ask why they invoke, compell, ... a certain aspect and what it looks like, it could get pretty crunchy. But I think that actually asking these questions makes story emerge quite well. I haven't had the chance to play Fate face to face yet, and found the counter compells slowing down forum based play quite a bit, but I do watch the Nebula Jazz show where Adam Koebel runs Fate Accellerated for some very creative people that know how stories work. Things totally emerge from the narrative there.<br/><br/>I think Fate as a system is sometimes a bit difficult to wrap the head around, but once you get the hang of it it seems to run quite well.<br/><br/>The only thing that could work against the emergent part is that with the aspects it tends to be a bit more meta, since you know each other's characters and use player knowledge over character knowledge in compelling and invoking for better dramatic effect. But understanding or deciding to not let your character alone be important but the group or the story will only improve it I think.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not an expert on the game but I am a fan of it. Feel free to correct me, more experienced players/GM's <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            This feels like a false comparison to me. I'm not an expert in Fate, but isn't there an option to skip the C/C/C stuff and just resolve things with one roll like you would in any other game?<br/><br/>The C/C/C system is there for when you want stuff with more dramatic slowdown and zoom in on individual actions.  If you don't want that, don't use it. The rules never tell you that you HAVE to use those rules for anything. <br/><br/>As for the whole reroll schpiel, rerolling is usually suboptimal unless you rolled terribly, so it just comes down to adding a detail and adding +2.  "I'm a SCIENTIST, so I'm going to attack this super methodically, testing out each option against my hypothesis. Bam. +2" <br/><br/>Add to this, the fact that the various steps in the resolution where characters have the option to spend fate points is, essentially, trading speed of resolution for greater player input into what they want the result to be.    In AW, if you go aggro and roll a 4, that's it, MC hard move incoming.   Hope you're okay with that, because you can't do anything about it.  That is not true in Fate.  So the players who are not the MC have more authority over how the story unfolds. You could argue that that's less "emergent" and then I could argue that having 5 people guiding the story with less input from the dice is just as emergent as having one person guiding the story with more input from the dice.  It's just a question of preferences.<br/><br/>Edit: Overall, the OP actually seems weird to me - because it reads like this:<br/><br/>"I talked to a bunch of people who find Fate's resolution mechanic cumbersome."<br/>"Does that mean it is bad for emergent story?"<br/><br/>These two statements seem utterly unrelated to me. You could create very intricate rules that take a long time that do an amazing job of surprising everyone at the table, or you could do a super simple fast system that injects no randomness at all.                          </div>

                            It's personal taste. And by "personal taste" I mean, 'people have different capabilities and propensities for doing different things, and this makes different things feel more or less difficult for them'. The fact that there are people out there who master Fate and use it fluidly in service of their play (I'll just, you know, skip this whole issue of whether they're doing story or whatever with it) pretty much proves conclusively that it's personal taste, whatever you or I might personally think.                        </div>

There is more to this, but let's say that this is not a bad summary ^_^<br/><br/>I might have expressed myself poorly by talking on emergent story in this context. Right now I have confusion in my head and I'm trying to clean it up also thanks to this thread.<br/>The connection I drew between the resolution mechanic and emergent story came from my ruminations after receiving that feedback... like... if that one mechanic is so cumbersome and problematic, is it doing its job?<br/>Is it coherently going in the same direction as the rest of the system?<br/>And if so, does this negative feedback highlights mere personal taste, or an actual usability issue?<br/><br/>I don't usually take negative feedback so hard. But this time, for many reasons, it hit me unexpectedly and made me fall into a pit of doubt :P                        </div>

                            Maybe asking for "meta-strategy" at the very same time as you have to resolve "action" is ill-conceived indeed. (brackets meaning : for lack of better terms at the moment). In a game the players need time. <br/><br/>Designing my game that's a question I had : what would be the best time for the player  to brew his strategy ? Should it be discussed in common ? Should the player have a menu of clear cut strategic options ? I specifically wanted to avoid strategic considerations during the time when you have to narrate, act or feel from your character point of view, like action, resolution and direct consequences. I preferred this solution : everyone has to find time to think about the story as a big picture when another player is talking. Balanced by the fact that the particulars of her narration are quickly changing the situation you will have to interact with, so you should pay attention. In a nutshell : like in any other board or card game. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a> : "Mind not that to resolve a single situation you often spend a lot of time performing a lot of not-so-decisive moves." but then you give yourself more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">time</span> to think before acting "decisively". (btw, this is often bad news, as it degrades the value of actions : the system should take care of this "OK, the mug is unbreakable , but what about the mug <i>handle</i> ?" <del>strategy</del> problem)                        </div>

I'm sorry. I kept mentioning Fate because the target mechanic is the same, and Fate is supposedly more familiar to everyone. But, as mentioned maybe not so clearly in the OP, all the discussion revolvs around <b>FateLess</b> ... which is gmLess and very much story-emergent.<br/><br/>So in the context of FateLess I suddenly got this bunch of feedbacks from different people at different times, all saying "<i>all is cool and we love the emergent story and all BUT when you get to the dice rolling part it feels meh</i>".<br/>And drilling down on such feedbacks turns out that the "problem" was the resolution structure I described above, the dice roll that is then modified in cumbersome and unwieldy ways (for some people, at least).<br/><br/>That's the cusp of my doubts.<br/>Is indeed the Fate approach the best for my purposes?<br/>So far it has worked egregiously... but maybe I could do better?                        </div>

And made me think a bit of the thread about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21336/subtleties-in-what-we-say-at-the-table" rel="nofollow">subtleties in what we say at the table </a>. I'm suspecting most of the problem is in the conversation that players use to engage with this system. <br/><br/>Any group of players that has internalized a system enough to achieve Flow with it will not notice their conversation turning less and less immersion-breaking on those parts where the system is engaged; for them it will feel natural and even exciting to engage with those parts of the system. However, for players used to different systems that deal with different parts of the fiction generation/negotiation, having the system deal with other parts for which they have already developed a natural conversational solution will definitely feel cumbersome and immersion-breaking.<br/><br/>So, no wonder why Fate, Fateless, PbtA or any other games appeal different types of players. If you are already used to negotiating the fiction only before the roll, when you see a system that gives you the option to do it also after the roll, you will feel it's advantageous to the player, cumbersome and immersion-breaking. But if you manage to keep negotiation to a minimum both after and before the roll, the system will feel helpful for negotiations instead of something that slows down the game whenever it's engaged.<br/><br/>Not everything is of course in the things said, a big part of it is in the things players have to keep in mind whenever they are using the system, which can be traced back to the way the designer explained the game to the players. If the concepts are clear and somewhat familiar, the chances that players internalize the system before dropping the game will definitely rise and turn it into a keeper for them. To the point they will port that way of thinking and the phrases they are used to, when they switch games.                        </div>

<blockquote>Any group of players that has internalized a system enough to achieve Flow with it will not notice their conversation turning less and less immersion-breaking on those parts where the system is engaged; for them it will feel natural and even exciting to engage with those parts of the system.</blockquote>
Bingo.<br/><br/>Where Fate fell down for my group--and this is a group-system incompatibility because we're mostly traditional gamers at heart--was how the mechanics are calibrated in a way that modeling the fictional scenario can be done with a variety of mechanics. We repeatedly ran into issues with whether something was an Overcome or Create Advantage, how Aspects functioned, etc. The problems were compounded by Fate Accelerated's broad approaches. (Cleverly vs. Carefully, for instance.)<br/><br/>The opposite approach, where every subsystem has a detailed breakdown of special mechanics, feels more usable as a game, but it runs into the issue of being complex and potentially cumbersome.<br/><br/>You mentioned the following:
<blockquote>So in the context of FateLess I suddenly got this bunch of feedbacks from different people at different times, all saying "all is cool and we love the emergent story and all BUT when you get to the dice rolling part it feels meh".</blockquote>
My experience also. Now, I believe that this is a matter of Fate's weak stakes. Your character in Fate is almost always safe. There's not potential for anything to go tragically wrong: all the mechanics are geared toward Saturday Morning Cartoon-style "the PCs beat up Skeletor and he curses them from afar" gameplay. Your mileage may vary; this is my own perception.<br/><br/>However, for your own players, you said:
<blockquote>And drilling down on such feedbacks turns out that the "problem" was the resolution structure I described above, the dice roll that is then modified in cumbersome and unwieldy ways (for some people, at least).</blockquote>
Agreed on this. Tracking multiple Aspects and invocations is very unwieldy. I will say that the trend I've noticed in some storygames is very complex setups for resolution systems. Burning Wheel (<i>et al</i>.) have their systems of helper dice, Wises, FoRKs, and so forth. Fate has the listed invokes/Aspects/Fate points. Dogs in the Vineyard has its poker dice.<br/><br/>These systems work quite well when you're navigating a single-roll conflict resolution. Assemble the dice, roll, determine outcome. They fall apart when dealing with multiple rolls. It becomes tiresome (uninteresting) following this procedure for multiple rolls for the same conflict. Given Fate's dice probabilities, I believe that rolling the dice more than once is unnecessary in most scenarios.                        </div>

                            What ValyrianSteelKatana said. It's exactly been my issue with FATE. I love Aspects and think that's a great innovation; but at the table my group and I were constantly having to look up details about what was an Overcome vs. something else, what a tie meant in this instance as opposed to another, and so on. The resolution structure got so much in the way for me that I started to actually hate the game, and would rather never play it again. <br/><br/>No offense intended to those that like it, and I'm genuinely curious whether people really like the FATE resolution system - and if so, what it is that they like - or whether they just tolerate it. That's an honest question, not rhetorical.                         </div>

                            I've got a theory about it, but haven't played Fate so I can't confirm it. Anyone here has internalized Fate? How many aspects would you say, were mentioned before each roll? Less than three? And after the roll?<br/><br/>How about those who felt the dice rolling was meh? How many aspects would any player cram into a roll, as an average? How much time did they use to do that? Would you say Fate rolls take more, equal or less time than a trad game rolls?<br/><br/>You see, if a game conversation where the players engage with the system takes more time and feels less "exciting" than when using a different system you have already interiorized, chances are that you will definitely feel that the new system used is inneficient, rising the chances of breaking the immersion. On other aspects the system may shine brighter, but conflict negotiation and resolution are way too crucial. There are many different types of fun there, but if it isn't one that appeals the players, or if it gets on the way of the fun they already have, they will definitely feel that part of the system is meh and worth changing, not using at all or even a deal breaker.                        </div>

                            I'd say that you just need to show in detail how the conversation goes when you play, the phrases used, how much time you spent discussing each step and the frame of mind used for each step. Even if you think you already explained enough it may be not enough for some people.<br/><br/>Looks like they are thinking that, by the description, some of those steps must happen always, in te same order, be completely conscious all the time and get in the way of the fiction to play their part, when in reality it's the opposite: The fiction will guide the use of the system, no part of the system conversation must take longer than reasonable and thus exploiting the system to reduce risk to zero never actually happens, if you keep in mind that overusing aspects is against common sense since you can't cram them on a single conflict without making the fiction look silly.                        </div>

                            Here's what's in Fateless that still gets in the way for me (this is just me, YMMV): an action is described, a decision is made whether it's an overcome or create advantage, a difficulty is assigned, then people decide whether to go ahead and roll or create other advantages (in which case a difficulty is assigned anew), then a roll is made, at which point fate chips can be spent to modify the outcome or roll again, and then depending on that outcome another roll may be made yet again for soft/hard opposition. For me, this takes me out of the story too much, especially the part after assigning difficulty - at that point I have to think game-mechanical tactics (how many aspects are applicable, how many advantages do I have to create to have a good chance, etc.)  rather than what's happening in the fiction/SIS. <br/><br/>Do some people like this crunchy part of it, or do they just go along with it because they're used to it? That's my question:)                        </div>

                            That makes sense to me. Do people then play the game mechanics-first? I mean, I'm just about the farthest from a Fate guru, but the shape of that issue is a familiar one: some games tacitly assume that the players will be playing the mechanics, while others assume that the players will be playing the fiction. If Fate (or Fateless) were a game of the latter kind, it could be the case that the players are <i>not</i> supposed to engage in aspect-counting - maybe you're just supposed to declare your action, and if that action seems like aspect-creating, then you do that, if it seems to be decisive (regarding the conflict at hand, I mean), then you go straight for the kill. Just read if off the fiction instead of optimizing the mechanics. Same for the other rules, I suppose, like spending fate chips: that kind of rule in many games ends up not being too tactical simply because it is so direct about expressing creative desire; you only do it when the situation is a big deal for your character, so it's basically the fiction that determines when you do it, not mechanical optimization.<br/><br/>I suppose somebody more familiar with the system could tell us if that makes any sense at all. If "playing the fiction" just results in futility because the game assumes that you pay attention to your math, then we might be observing the hard technical floor of Fate: this is what you have to do to play the game, and if it's too much to enjoy, then that's one game that's no good for you.<br/> </div>

                            Speaking purely for myself, here - I agree that this almost entirely a matter of taste - my limited experience with Fate has been that a lot of those steps do not feel entirely relevant to the fictional experience, or the fictional reality being experienced/explored.<br/><br/>For example, "tagging Aspects" sounds like a straightforward procedure, but then it's tied in with spending Fate points and the advice to write fairly fictionally ambiguous Aspects.<br/><br/>What does it mean when I don't have enough Fate to spend? Is my Aspect "Rough Around the Edges" applicable here? Who decides?<br/><br/>A lot of the system seems to resolve around cosmetic elements of the fiction (e.g. "My character is 'Rough Around the Edges', as you can see here because he just spit out his cigar onto the floor) and the arithmetic of point-spending. These are fine - especially so if emphasizing the "cosmetics", or vibe/style/genre, is your goal - but they don't feel like in-character choices at all.<br/><br/>I tend to prefer game mechanics where each choice can map to something happening in the story. For example, if invoking 'Rough Around the Edges' meant I might hurt someone I didn't intend to, now it's an interesting choice for me.<br/><br/>A lot of this may have to do with both the way you parse these decisions (as in Eero's example) and the way you write Aspects, however. Limiting what can be an Aspect and where they apply may be sufficient to solve some of this.<br/><br/>Another example is "spending points after the roll". I don't think there is anything particularly wrong with that in general - indeed, I like games which give you that option - but I'd prefer for it to mean something to the characters involved and the direction of the plot/story. In Fate, however, it's purely an arithmetic measure, and your concern is, "Do I want this to end as victory or failure? How many points is that worth to me?" Those are fine, but I don't find them particularly compelling as a player.                        </div>

Most trad games have a different kind of fun going along the fictional negotiation: it's system navigation and mastering, the challenge of optimizing your resources and finding synergies hidden in the rules. The reward for that is obtaining agency in the fiction. If you try to port that kind of fun into Fate, the game breaks. Fate gets rid of crunchy rules to focus on letting the players define the fiction, instead of having the system as an interface to tell them what will happen; in this exchange, the optimization game is totally lost as it loses focus and means to get implemented.<br/><br/>This is why the main audience of Fate are players who aren't too much into system mastering, or are even totally against it, and prefer to have more freedom from the system, a freedom that they have learned to manage responsibly. I've seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU" rel="nofollow">this video on Tabletop</a> and even considering it's edited, it doesn't seem like each player is trying to cram all their aspects on each roll, nor that rolls become inconsequential. Sure, the game still has this power fantasy atmosphere with characters larger than life, but it doesn't mean they can get with whatever they want all the time.<br/><br/> </div>

                            I've been discussing this both on G+ and Facebook with Fate aficionados.<br/>I believe that, in the end, it really is about how the basic Fate approach to the game feels to you.<br/><br/>Fate is very much a <b>colour-first</b> (or cosmetics-first, as <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> would put it?) game of <b>pulp</b> action.<br/>The two main things are:<br/>- represent/highlight colourful details of the fiction<br/>- see what happens next, as in, the consequences of PC actions, rather than testing if such actions succeed or fail (although failure is still very real and possible)<br/><br/>This, I believe, is just a slight deviation from what AW offers itself.<br/><br/>Pulp means, in Fate, the ability to look a failed roll in the face and say "<i>But I am a <b>Depressed Mad Scientist</b> and I will try to open this effing door by applying eldritch osmosis!</i>" and possibly turn a failure into a success.<br/>It's about the ability to have a say in how the story goes, beyond your luck with dice.<br/>The whole economy of Fate points is there to create a relative scarcity for this, so that the Players will invest points (and time, and creative effort) only when it is <b>important</b> to them.<br/>Squander your points on every single unimportant failed roll, and the system self-balances by running out of such points, so when it actually matters to you, you are stuck with whatever the dice say.<br/><br/>Here lays the difference with, for example, AW.<br/>In AW all the manoeuvrings and negotiations happen before the roll, to establish if/when/which Move to apply... but once a Move is selected, that's it. If the dice say f-you, that's that. And you go on to the next Move.<br/>You do often have to make <b>additional mechanical choices</b> in AW too, about Holds and tokens and picking effects and questions etc ... but I believe they feel less invasive because they are not about changing the outcome, just about <b>seeing it through</b> in detail.<br/>All in all this justifies, among other things, why AW would feel less complex and more fluid than Fate.<br/><br/>Discussing with the Fate crowd, it turns out that the ability to change an important outcome is valued enough to make the cost in added complexity feel like it's worth it.<br/>Snd not only that, but they actually embrace such complexity, because it is exactly when you can most meaningfully represent the things you care about of your PC, all the "I prevail because I'm the <b>son of a lost culture</b>" kind of stuff. Even when, despite all your efforts, you end up failing no matter what.<br/>The important bit, the representation of colour, the cosmetic highlight, happened <i>because</i> of such mechanics, and that's what matters most.<br/>To them.<br/><br/>I can see the value there. It's possibly the reason I chose Fate as a fundamental base for my own FateLess system.<br/>But I also personally prefer a much lighter crunch. With less numbers. And FateLess does this to a great extent. Compared to Fate all the numbers are much less arbitrary and instead come from the direct observation of the fiction, and are very few and far between, to begin with.<br/><br/>Still... numbers or no numbers... the complexity we are discussing comes from the underlying structure:<br/>- describe<br/>- roll<br/>- outcome<br/><b>- put some element of the fiction in the spotlight to alter the outcome</b><br/>- final outcome<br/><br/>I'm considering ways to make it lighter.<br/>Like, normally when you Invoke an Aspect you have to choose between 2 mechanical effects (reroll or get +2) and sometimes one is more convenient, sometimes the other is better, and this is 100% unrelated to the fiction. Streamlining this to be a single effect instead of a purely mechanical choice could help.<br/>Still, it won't change the structure: you DO always have the option to leverage Aspects in order to modify the Outcome of a test.<br/><br/>Although I am noticing one thing between the people that speak in favour of such structure, and the ones (me included) that are expressing doubts about it.<br/><br/>When "we" talk about the outcome-modifying part we seem to envision it in an awkward and unsatisfying way. We envision <b>one</b> action being tested, and then its outcome being pulled here and there, in more or less reasonable ways, until finally the resolution of that first action is concluded.<br/>I can picture in my head a PC swinging a punch, having it stop mid air, waiting and waiting until stuff happens, and finally being freed to complete the swing and hit the guy in front of them.<br/>I've played it myself like this when I first tacked Fate, and I've seen many people play it like this too. But it was a long long time ago.<br/><br/>Instead (most) Fate supporters today seem to clearly see this situation with a completely different flow. Admittedly, such flow is only hinted at in the original Fate rules, as an aside optional note.<br/>(and in FateLess there is no mention of it, regrettably; something I'll soon fix)<br/>But long time Fate players all seem to have it internalised as the obvious way to play.<br/>Which is...<br/> </div>

                            Hi Hasimir, I like the way you described the bar fight above - but in practice what would happen in the group I played FATE with is more like this: the GM presents an obstacle or opponent we must overcome with a high stat, like +6 or +8; we then have to figure out how to get enough of a bonus to at least equal that, so we check to see how we can create advantages, what aspects we can use, and so on - all game-mechanical reasoning, not fictional (in fact we had to struggle sometimes to see how to create advantage in the fiction, which could be quite frustrating if we were still 2 or more under the big bad guy, and had no idea how to get that one more advantage). This kind of thing is what got in the way of fun for me, personally. <br/><br/>I'm <b>not</b> saying you should change Fateless - I bought the current version and will buy the final version, as I think you have great ideas and want to support your work.

Isn't that what succeed with a cost is for? <br/><br/>You narrate what you're doing to create advantages, spend invokes to improve the roll, both of which require fiction or they don't happen. If you fail, you either don't Overcome the obstacle and the fiction progresses, or you succeed with a major cost and the fiction progresses.                        </div>

                            I imagine that how the resolution system actually interconnects with the dramatic aspirations of play would have a major impact on how frustrating or supportive one would find Fate to be. For instance, are conflicts there so you can and need to win them to progress (in the process showcasing your character's awesomeness), or are they there as forks on the road, points at which the story can tumble in different directions? In the former case the rules become requirements to fulfill so you can win and progress, while in the latter there's much less need to force the issue, and you therefore have more freedom to simply apply what the fiction suggests to you, and let the outcome be what it may. Are advantages something you discover (to showcase the fictional situation), or something you invent (to perform cleverly and overcome the difficult situation)?<br/><br/>There being this much variance in how one could conceivably use the resolution system itself, as a separate module, it's pretty difficult to say whether it's useful or not. Maybe it would be more useful, were it being used in a way that benefits more from what it does?                        </div>

                            If only the text might chime in on this frustration. Some guidance on whether failure should be a fork in the road or a road block. Oh, wait...
<blockquote>The <i>worst</i>, worst thing you can do is have a failed roll that means <i>nothing happens</i>—no new knowledge, no new course of action to take, and no change in the situation. That is totally boring, and it discourages players from invest-ing in failure—something you absolutely want them to do, given how important compels and the concession mechanic are. Do not do this.<br/><br/>If you can't imagine an interesting outcome from both results, then don't call for that roll. If failure is the uninteresting option, just give the PCs what they want and call for a roll later, when you can think of an interesting failure.</blockquote> </div>

                            In theory, <b>and by the book</b>, conflicts are just dramatic moments. Forks on the road. Opportunities to shine.<br/>In practice, according to my personal experience and a lot of friend's reports, normal Fate (Core/Accelerated) can be made very Trad and even railroady if the GM so wishes and the Players don't know any better. Even Fred Hicks offered advice that is 100% legit and effective but I could only see fit at a veeery gmLed table; it's just how Fate Core is built.<br/><br/>But still, by the book it's a fork.<br/>So yeah. The game assumes not every conflict is worth pouring time and creative effort and Fate points into turning an unfavourable outcome into a favourable one.<br/>This, and the fact that you usually roll dice much less frequently than, say, in AW.<br/><br/>About Aspects... they are both pre-set and spontaneously made.<br/>They define stuff about your PC, her items and relationships and powers and flaws and whatever.<br/>They are also discovered or even created on the spot, both through simple narration or with specific actions (Create Advantage).<br/><br/>Discussing with friends... the main problem they seem to have with this approach is... you follow the fiction, you follow the scene, you follow the action. And at some point you get to this conflict. A cliffhanger. A fork. You have a picture in your head because of all that has already been established so far. You roll and... and if you want to modify the outcome you have to switch the mental gears used so far, take a different play stance, and put creative effort starting from what could be described as unstable footing.<br/><br/>To describe it again.
<blockquote>If you fancy having influence over the outcome, you then have to step back from the action and find ways to have one or more of your Aspects somehow fit into the narrative.<br/>Done wrong (how I usually see it done) you just point your finger to an Aspect and try to have the other Players see how it makes sense for it to help.<br/>Done right (according to a footnote in the rulebook and what amounts to a lot of "<i>GM savvyness</i>" from the community) you would have to come up with a negative but not decisive outcome for your failed roll, then describe a continuation of your action that leverages an Aspect.<br/>THEN you spend 1 fate, and have to make a mechanically relevant choice: reroll or +2 ?<br/>Knowing that maybe you will need to leverage one more Aspect anyway to get to the victory condition.<br/>THEN if things go wrong anyway you have to decide if it is worth, after all the points spent and the descriptions provided, to accept a Serious cost to finally win no matter what the dice say.</blockquote>
This <b>to me</b> is not a chore. It is fun. It is interesting. It produces <b>more</b> fiction. It turns a simple Yes/No test into a dynamic action scene that showcases the PC's traits.<br/>It is what everyone in the Fate communities I visited loves and considers THE game. Not just a part of it, but the core feature.<br/><br/>But I have to admit that I can see also the problem some people have with it.<br/>They go with the flow of the scene, and this procedure simply does not click with them; it breaks the flow, and then asks them to come up with more narration starting from what, to them, is now suddenly weak footing.<br/><br/>I have a <b>very bright and creative</b> player that, even in the lighter and more cooperative FateLess, struggles visibly whenever she could and would Invoke an aspect... and gets frustrated when she sees how other Players, more keen to this system, effortlessly come up with descriptions to leverage 2-3-4 Aspects each.<br/>This produces that not ideal feedback where she enjoys the game, the story, she even enjoys most of the mechanics... but when she gets to the dice rolling part... meh! :P                        </div>

                            When playing with Fate, I take a cue from PbtA: "Never speak the name of your move." In this case, never speak the name of your Aspect. Describe what you're doing in terms of the Aspect, but don't say "I invoke my Son of a Gun Aspect to get +2." Describe it fictionally. I trust the players to tag their own Aspects honestly enough.<br/><br/>As an example of this in <a href="https://youtu.be/aNL9oljAFqM" rel="nofollow">Return of the King</a> where Eowyn invokes her <b>Shieldmaiden of Rohan</b> Aspect: "I am no man!" The Fate system spoils the scene a bit with its implementation, as it turns into players saying "I invoke my Aspect for a +2 to my Attack, plus I'm tagging the Witch-king's consequence that Merry just created, bringing my total to +8, doing 4 shifts of damage and Taking Out the Witch-king."                        </div>

                            I feel like Fate Core works best with players who are playing in the spirit of "let's use fate points and aspects to tell the best story" rather than in the spirit of "let's use fate points and aspects to win a decisive victory as frequently as possible." When players are focused on the story, they only invoke aspects occasionally, and not many at a time, when the aspect seems especially relevant and bringing it up feels narratively satisfying. When players are focused on winning, there's a constant back and forth as they just read off the names of aspects to justify spending as many points as they need to before the GM gives up and tells them they've won.<br/><br/>In other words, I feel like Fate Core works best when the players are a little more comfortable thinking like GMs. It has been miserable for me when I have played it with players who never GM anything and almost exclusively play D&amp;D 4th edition. It has been great for me when I have played with people who GM a lot.                        </div>

                            As far as I understand, in Fate, a player can typically guarantee or almost guarantee success by using a sufficient number of fate points and aspects, etc., at least once in a while (when it matters and when they would like to succeed).<br/><br/>In PBTA-type games, guaranteeing 7+ result is usually difficult and guaranteeing 10+ impossible.<br/><br/>As such, I'd assume any situation where dice are rolled would be more uncertain in PbtA.<br/><br/>Assuming dice rolls are called for with roughly equal frequency (not an entirely implausible assumption for a given group even when using a different game), and supposing the group is used to dice bringing a lot of the uncertainty, then I guess PbtA would in general be more surprising than Fate. This is one way of creating emergence.<br/><br/>But there were a lot of assumptions above.                        </div>

                            The point of contention is not dice-roll number distribution.<br/>The point it is:<br/><br/>- Fate creates an outcome and then allows Players to change it multiple times by spending a mix of game-points and creative effort... this produces a highly <b>representative</b> fiction, drilling down into the details of an action and the aspects (literally) of how and why a Character faces it<br/><br/>- other systems (for example AW) create an outcome... and that's it. End of the story. You now have to follow through with whatever that outcome dictated. Especially in PbtA systems this also moves the fiction either around or forward, while giving it a relatively specific "shape" as a by-product of how Moves work.<br/><br/>Also... in Fate (at least by the book) you roll pretty seldomly. Each roll represents something big and important. And the roll, as extended and modified as it can be, will resolve the whole thing.<br/><br/>On the contrary in PbtA you roll very often, as your fiction will trigger some Moves whenever you describe something triggering them. And a single move is usually not enough to solve a whole situation.<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>Starting from this, the original doubt was about the ability of the Fate structure to be in itself enjoyable, not in the way of creativity (is it defeating the purpose for which it was created?).<br/><br/>The answer, as it happens, is yes... the Fate structure is perfectly fine in the opinion of the whole Fate-loving segment of players. I just bumped into a bunch of people that instead have problems with that approach, all at once, in rapid succession... which took me a bit by surprise and made me question the system itself.                        </div>

                            I don't think it is bad for emergent stories in the general sense. I do find it not good for the sort of heart on your sleeve everyone playing to find out what happens sort of emergent play that games like Sorcerer, Dogs in the Vineyard, and Apocalypse World tend to excel at.<br/><br/>When I play Fate I feel like we are all conspiring to direct a movie. I never really get the sense of being audience as well as author. It tends to drag me more towards advocating for the story I want rather than inhabiting the fiction.                        </div>

I think it's not only because some tables are not used to it, or because any "stance" thing, but mainly because it's a lot of decisions in the middle of the action. It depends on the dice so you can't plan ahead. If one player is slow in decisions, the game stops for too long. <br/><br/>"The outcome is narrated. It is real. It happened." : this freeform / LARP principle is good for a high event/crunch ratio.<br/> </div>

                            About a year and a half ago I noticed something similar when running a game with lots of decision points mid-resolution. Players would:<br/><br/>1. trigger the roll by in-fiction action<br/>2. Decide whether to apply a Trait (a 1/act resouce) for +2d<br/>3. Decide whether to apply a Technique (a 1/turn resource) for +2d<br/>4. Roll the dice<br/>5. Decide whether to elaborate on their description in a way that makes use of the concrete situation or environment<br/>6. Decide whether to exhaust a resource<br/>7. Decide whether to spend Willpower<br/><br/>...and in a conflict, you have two players doing that.<br/><br/>Compared to Apoc World, the Spicy roll, or the simplest forms of Task or Conflict resolution, it has sooooo mannnny decision points, and you really feel it.                        </div>

                            A Fate aspect is way versatile. If you find the right combination of words, the right excuse, you can fit it almost anywhere. I know that's a feature of the game and not a bug, but it will definitely make players waste time squeezing their brains out for a way to cram that clevered named aspect into a situation it wasn't created for.                        </div>

                            I think one element of Fate (Core) that I find underimplemented which might be relevant here is the rapidity at which Aspects are meant to be changed. I get why someone might say "well, if you have simple Aspects there's not much that can come emergently from them" but honestly according to the rules you should be changing an Aspect almost once a session to keep them pointed and relevant to what's going on in the game.                        </div>
