It is necessary to close off the impulse to \u201cmake it\u201d in order to open oneself.\u201d (56)<br/><br/>\u201cThe creative impulse can't grow in a climate of competition (like auditions) where it is necessary to prove one's value. Nor can acting classes whose purpose is to groom the actor for hiring take the time or risk to experiment with what the teacher doesn't know. But working with the \u201cdon't knows\u201d is perhaps more important than teaching the \u201cknows.\u201d (56-57)<br/><br/>\u201cThe assumption. It would be good for certain boundaries, tacit as well as defined, to be broken. It would be good to have a tossing up of values and experiment with the comedy of sincerity, breaking down the structure that we work within, like a person whose habits in living have him impales in patterns of acting which anchor him. It would be good to change the relationships which we are frozen in: Theater, audiences', directors', and actors' relationships. Other kinds of recognition scenes must be played out.\u201d (57)<br/><br/>Chaikin, Joseph. The Presence of the Actor. New York: Theatre Communications Group, 1991.
