It was sweet, and the players are excited about doing some more (drilling down on particular areas to make starting-PC-level stuff).  They also "get" how we'll be able to trot this method out later on if the game starts to stall, so the GM isn't burdened by the prep.<br/><br/>Anybody want to see the rules?  I recorded it but haven't typed the transcript yet, I can talk about some AP stuff too if people are interested.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
