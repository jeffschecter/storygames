They are not highly educated and are the sixth generation to live in this place, thus a lot of the knowledge their great-great-great-grandparents knew has been diluted, distorted, or lost completely. To the current generation the ship is all that is and what lies beyond its reinforced walls is a mystery and the stuff of late night scary stories. The particular area of the ship our community is confined to is the ship's landfill. Here is where the waste from daily operations is deposited and eventually flushed out into the beyond after being sorted by automatons and pushed into pneumatic tubes. The automatons have no personalities and never interact with the community and the community sees them as moving tools. The resources currently available to the community are as follows:<br/><br/>Organic Waste Matter (Abundant, the large misshapen mass in the top left corner)<br/>Inorganic Waste Matter (Scarce)<br/>Environmental Condensation (Scarce)<br/>Ship's Oil Leakage (Scarce)<br/>Electricity (Scarce, requires electrician knowledge to fully harness)<br/><br/>Week 1 - <b>There is a disquieting legend about this place. What is it?</b> or...Alarming weather patterns destroy something. How and what?<br/><br/>Waste Shaman Korddry gathers the children around a fire (started with some of the organic waste, and it burns incredibly bright) and tells them of the creature Fenbian. It is said that four generations ago Fenbian rose from the waste mountain and devoured dozens of children. After he digested them they were excreted as his minions and plagued our community for months. Fenbian was vanquished when the automatons tore him apart and flushed him in the tubes. We still fear that he will rise again and everyday that the waste arrives and sloughs onto the top of the mountain we hold our breaths and wait to see his glowering eyes.<br/><br/>Action: Discover something new - A previously undiscovered (or forgotten generations ago) access tunnel is discovered after Digger Brenzow tunnels his way through a waste pile that has been forgotten by the automatons. It's it not known what this tunnel leads to and the utility lights are dimmed or broken. If a trip down this tunnel were to occur, the explorers would need some of the high burning waste to light their way. One observer who was watching the tunnel late that night claimed they heard bestial cries echoing from somewhere far away.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/huckabees" title="huckabees"><img alt="huckabees" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/huckabees">huckabees</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402400/#Comment_402400" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T15:41:16+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  3:41PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Week 2 - <b>A charismatic young girl convinces many to help her with an elaborate scheme.

How does the community respond?<br/><br/>Young Myrtis steps forward during one of the weekly council meetings drawing looks of disgust from the four elders. She states that the gods of the waste have shown them this access tunnel as a message that it is time to leave this place. She manages to convince about 20 of the younger community members to embark on an expedition down the tunnel. She promises that they will find a land of plenty, it will be the place the waste comes from before it is waste. Myrtis holds up the rotted skins of fruits and exclaims that the tunnel will take them to a place where the fruit is fresh, something the community has experienced rarely. The elders, led by Shaman Korddry attempt to blockade Myrtis and her people, but inevitably give in knowing that the desire of youth seem to always overpower the warnings of the old. <br/><br/><i>Project</i> - Explore the Access Tunnel: Est time to completion 4 weeks.<br/><br/><b>Action:</b> <i>Discover something new</i> - Years of leaking fluids from the ship's engines have caused a panel to the south to begin to rot away. Gunner Mauriz leads a group of five through the hole in the dense wall and finds a large barrel like container with a series of pipes coming in and out of it that disappear into the walls of the ship. The barrel is approx. 12m high and diameter of approx. 80m. The barrel is constructed of metal, but the type is unknown to the community. Gunner Mauriz fires on the barrel to test its strength and finds his energy weapon barely leaves a scorch mark. The atmosphere in the new chamber is equally as humid as the waste room but much cooler and many of the group relax for a bit in the cool air. Upon returning to the community, Gunner Mauriz produces four sluglike organisms that he found clinging to the tubing in the room. The slugs are fried up and devoured quickly. It has been a long time since they have eaten fresh meat.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/huckabees" title="huckabees"><img alt="huckabees" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/huckabees">huckabees</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402404/#Comment_402404" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T16:24:03+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  4:24PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Week 3 - <b>There\u2019s a large body of water on the map.

By sheer luck they discover the reservoir room, where liquid waste is sent and is processed into clean water. To reach the clean water the group must ascend a ladder to the top of the processing vat. The vat is covered but there are hatches spread out across the vat. Myrtis tells her people to be careful because they do not understand the volatility of the machinery inside the vat.

Who is unhappy with this arrangement, and why? or...<b>What natural predators roam this area? Are you safe?</b><br/><br/>Since the wall rusted away something has gotten into the waste room. One of the guards was found torn apart when Sentry Filix came to relieve him from duty. Medic Zhulah said the body looked like sharp blades had torn it apart. A day later, one of the children, Gawan ran to his mother shouting about the wet monster biting the garbage man. Sentry Rollan and his crew ran out to the spot and found one of automatons being attacked by a four legged creature whose skin glistened with a perpetual dampness. It appeared to have a tongue that wrapped around the torso of the automaton. The machine, being mindless and unaware of the attack simply tried to carry on with its duties. Sentry Rollan took careful aim, knowing his energy pistol had about a 50/50 chance of working when he needed it to. The beast was struck and yelped while shuffling off into the depths of the waste mountains. Sentry Rollan knows that where there is one pest you find many others and now that the creature has been hurt it will return for vengeance.<br/><br/><b>Action</b>: <i>Start a project</i> - Construct weapons in preparation of the creature's return and if he brings others with him.

Where are they?

This rival tribe covers themselves in the black sludge that will drip from the inner guts of the ship and it is said they can be found in the levels above, living in Engine. Their weapons are cobbled together from broken Engine parts and they wear armor composed of cogs and bolts. A few of the more vicious lot have filed their teeth to points and then, in ritual performed on adolescents, had their teeth covered in hot liquid metal from the spare parts. In battle, they charge forward with a frightening grin, bearing shiny metallic fangs. The waste people do not know how the Oilmen survive up there in Engine. When they raid the wastes, they are only looking for inorganic materials and they seem to come at the same part of the cycle, just as new inorganic waste is dumped, as if they somehow know it is there. The community has never seen the Oilmen's children, only savage young men and women.<br/><br/><b>Project Completed</b> - <i>Going on a Slug Hunt</i><br/><br/>Gunner Mauriz and his hunting party return from the cold wet room with bundles of juicy slugs. A great feast is held and luckily enough in the last day a few pieces of fresh fruit were tossed into the wastes and these are used in the preparation of the slugs. The meals must be prepared over a fire built from waste so the food is always tainted with a certain sourness. But the community is used to this unique spin that is forced upon all their meals. Because of their life lived amongst waste the community's immune system is amazingly hearty and they are able to hold down this rather exotic food. One note, Gunner Whiloh has complained of stomach cramps an hour after the meal and has gone to lie down.<br/><br/><b>Action</b>: <i>Start a project</i> - Explore the wet cold room completely and look for access to other chambers with possibly more food.

Konducter was first seen by Scav Psyll who ran back to the village center and gathered up Gunner Mauriz and Sentry Fillix. The two, armed and ready, easily captured and bound Konducter who put up no fight at all. He simply grinned wide and allowed himself to be placed in a disposed food cargo crate.

Most of the children's time is devoted to scavenging with the adult Scavs. Children are very useful for squeezing into small pockets of the waste mountains to get valuables that have been buried deep. At birth, Shaman Korddry exposes the infant to a series of corked bottles he keeps hidden away. He says that the bottles contain the essence of evil spirits that can cause sickness.

The explorers observed automatons much like the ones from the waste room gathering up these same black sacks that line the walls in 4m high piles and loading them into a chute that appears to place them on the belt above.

The slug hunts have become a regular thing and it appears things are  okay. Then through the waste chutes comes a human body. It's discovered by Scav Giam and the elders inspect the corpse. It is female, wearing a one piece uniform. She appears to be in her late 20s-early 30s and has had her neck slashed open. Strips of skin are hooked on her fingernails. Shaman Korddry suspects something is wrong in the levels above and quickly places the body where an automaton can dispose of it. However, the automaton has no protocols to deal with this and ignores her. Shaman Korddry orders a couple Sentries to aid him in disposing of the body themselves in the out chutes. Never before has a community member interfered with the sorting and dispersion of waste. After the body is safely tucked away and voided into the beyond, the secretive trio return to the community without a word of what has happened. As Shaman Korddry passes the makeshift holding cell of the eerily still-grinning Konducter he glances in.

Why is this a risky place to store things?</b><br/><br/>What passes for food in the community is gathered from the waste that falls every few days or so. What has been deemed edible by the community are fruit skins and vegetable scraps. Protein comes in the form of the insects that inhabit the waste (Roaches, beetles, etc.) The amount of waste processed on board has led to nice plump roaches bursting with nutrition. Some of the more industrious community members have begun raising the insects in buckets that they will with waste to be devoured. Recently they have also had the slug hunts to gather a new form of protein rich nutrition. The most labor intensive form of food production is mold, which is grown on certain rotten organics. One of the difficulties with storing and cultivating these foods is short lifespan (for the bugs) and quick spoilage (for all the non-living organics). If the food is not hidden away well, it will be detected by the waste automatons and disposed of, a fact the early generations learned quickly and taught to their children. Through close monitoring, the paths of the automatons were mapped and the foodstuffs were stored outside of these ranges.<br/><br/><b>Action</b>: <i>Discover something new</i> - Gunners spot people resembling those Myrtis described attacking her group.

What has he done?<br/><br/>Young Velo is digging near the east waste hills, an area not frequented by the community in generations due to it being where the automatons normally place plastic goods. Plastic is toxic if burnt and not very reliable for shelters, though it lasts for a long time. Velo forms a pretty strong tunnel into the side of the hill and is about 15 feet in and finds a skeleton. Returning to the village he does as he has been taught and alerts one of the Sentries. Sentry Fillix takes a group of his men out to the hills and pulls out the skeleton. The remains are dressed in a dark blue uniform, not unlike Konducter's. After closer examination and cleaning, they find a name tag in on the left breast pocket that reads "Captain Korso".

Far to the north on the northside of the tallest waste mountain is a place where the mold grows in bright vibrant colors that the community does not even have names for. In the early times, this mold was thought to have magical properties and was harvested and ingested by a small sect of community members. Over time they became incredibly sick and their bodies deformed. At night the mold would glow a bright green blue that could be quite hypnotic. The Shamans quickly came to talk ill of this place explaining that while the ship was good it sometimes produced a poison and that poison would find its way into the Waste. The poison was an aspect of the ship that was to be respected and feared. It should not be ingested and members should keep their distance while admiring its beauty.<br/><br/><b>Project Completed</b> - <i>Sentry Laxin completes rebuilding and reactivating the large automaton</i>.<br/><br/>Laxin has nicknamed the large automaton Stark, a word he saw in ancient papers in the wastes.

If so, what family structures are common?<br/><br/>The highest status group in the community are the elders. Led by Shaman Korddry, the elders rise to their position first based on age. The old are revered by the community because all history is passed down orally so you rely on the eldest members to teach almost everything. The second step to becoming an elder is to pass the current Shaman's test of the spirits. As mentioned earlier, the Shaman has a collection of bottles that contain, in his words, "evil spirits". If a community member can withstand all of these and not become the slightest bit ill they are eligible to become an elder. The final step to become one of the elders is to be selected by them after performing some great task that was of benefit to the community. There has been controversy in the past about the politics behind certain selections, but a Shaman's word is law so the community usually quiets down.<br/><br/><b>Action</b>: <i>Start a project</i> - Use Stark, the heavy automaton to move large inorganic material and construct a village center, a place to commune.

Start a new project.<br/><br/>Gunner Mauriz and his posse have tracked the black clad men for a handful of hours and, knowing the terrain better, bottle them in at the end of a trash canyon. Taking advantage of this opportunity the Gunners and Sentries attack. Their prey has little time to respond as their throats are slit, their guts are speared, and few have limbs incinerated by barely working energy weapons. They group descends from the hills and into the massacre they caused below. One armored figure reaches for a crackling device on the shoulder of his uniform, what sounds like a voice comes out of it. "We've...been...hit" the figure gurgles into the device before Mauriz finishes him with direct blast to the head.<br/><br/><b>Action</b>: <i>Discover Something New</i> - The Enemy Camp<br/><br/>Gunner Mauriz and his crew head east and come across the encampment where these interlopers had set up. Going through the camp they find some functional weapons and a few sets of tools they aren't sure of the use for. Mauriz orders that everything be gathered up and it'll be sorted through later.

Do not reduce project dice this week.<br/><br/>Gunner Mauriz and his crew return to the center of the community to find that, just before they arrived, a young girl has gone missing. Her mother, Tender Rahel explains that her daughter, Dueon, went off to gather moss from the West Hills and hasn't been back for a night. A few sentries went in search of her but found nothing. They did find evidence of the wet creatures seen months ago. Mauriz orders the community go on lock down and assigns extra sentries to the nightwatch. He vows to Rahel he will find Dueon.

After a period of caution, observing to see what happened, he began playing around with a console. The language on the console was alien to him and the speech coming out of the room's AI was foreign as well. The only moment of real interest occurred when a small canister was dropped into one of the shattered tubes that stretch through the ceiling. Inside he canister was an off white, opaque substance that Tinker Mozz has kept secret and will experiment on when given the opportunity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/huckabees" title="huckabees"><img alt="huckabees" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/huckabees">huckabees</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403629/#Comment_403629" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-13T18:04:34+00:00" title="January 13, 2013  6:04PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2013 6:04PM by huckabees.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Summer Week 8 - <b>The eldest among you dies.

Do not reduce project dice this week.<br/><br/>The whole village was awoken by the screams of Healer Zola as she ran from the Shaman's hut. The elders gathered and she explained that she became concerned after Shaman Korddry reported he was feeling ill. When she went to check on him in the night she found him already dead...but not from an illness. His head has been blown clean off by one of the confiscated energy weapons Mauriz and his crew recovered. Gunner Mauriz orders a lockdown on the community's arsenal, leaving him the only one with direct access. An appropriate time of mourning begins but Mauriz pushes for work on the community's projects to continue as well, citing the impending attack by more of the black clad men. Thought it is drowned out by the fervor in the wake of Shaman Korrdry's death, Sentry Fellix insists he saw Gunner Mauriz visiting Korddry's hut the night of his death...<br/><br/><b>Project Completed</b> - Tender Mont completes the Slug Farm and is now harvesting fat, juicy slugs on a weekly basis.

The meeting is taken over by Gunner Mauriz who reasons that the time for all these ancient protocols is over. With the threat of interlopers attacking and killing them all it is time to hand the reigns of leadership over to the Gunners. The elders try to plead that this is not how things are done but Mauriz has rallied the community so successfully that the elders are drowned out by the chants of praise for Mauriz.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D" title="Noah_D"><img alt="Noah_D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D">Noah_D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405110/#Comment_405110" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-31T09:33:06+00:00" title="January 31, 2013  9:33AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, what happened next?!<br/><br/>(Thanks for this, I've enjoyed it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/huckabees" title="huckabees"><img alt="huckabees" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/huckabees">huckabees</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405142/#Comment_405142" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-31T15:16:01+00:00" title="January 31, 2013  3:16PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, what happened next?!<br/><br/>(Thanks for this, I've enjoyed it.)</blockquote>\nOh there's more coming this weekend.
