I noticed, like lots of other people, the influence of MMORPGs on what we know about the design.  On a whole it appears that they are taking elements of MMOs and incorporating it into the new design.  You couple that with the plans for <a href="http://www.gleemax.com/articles/announcement014.html" rel="nofollow">Gleemax</a> and my brain has begun to fire a bit.  <br/><br/>It appears that there is some sort of synergy going on here, or an attempt at it at least.  I for one am excited about the posibilites this has.  The narrowing of the digital divide as it were and what impact this is going to have on gaming as a whole has got me jazzed.  I see all sorts of possibilities for both 4E and other games.  <br/><br/>The questions I have for everyone are: \n<ul><li>What kind of impact is this stuff going to have on Story Games?  <br/></li><li>Are any other designers looking at ways of incorporating digital assets besides what exists for their games and what are they?<br/></li><li>Is anyone designing a game with the potentials of the intraweb in mind?</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95843/#Comment_95843" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T07:04:41+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  7:04AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keith, are you talking about things more internet-focused than designing games specifically for chat or play-by-email/post formats?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95851/#Comment_95851" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T07:31:32+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  7:31AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>A little of both I guess.

It had two layers, actually: a realm-level and a personal level. The realm-level was like a pared-down version of Civilization or similar games, with a grid map, exploration, finding monsters, building armies, research and development, resource management, etc. Only the realm leaders would directly play this game.<br/><br/>Individual characters had skills. And every week (one turn on the realm level) they could determine which skill they were using in support of their realm. This would give benefits to the realm leader: scouting = free explored square (skill rating determines possible distance from cities), trading = bonus resources, fighting = bonus to troops in combat, intelligence = give insight into another player's resource levels or explored squares, and so on. This would allow for the player characters to actually be valuable to the realm. It also encourages recruitment of players by realm owners.<br/><br/>The personal play level was mostly freeform, because that's how we roll where I come from <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Though skills could be used to arbitrate conflicts if necessary. Basically, the idea was for the realm-level and the map to give context to the personal level freeform play. Sadly, the forum we were playing in at the time kind of fell apart during the development of the game, so I never got to test it. This was about five or six years ago.<br/><br/>(For those who read the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4112" rel="nofollow">Where do you get your ideas from</a> thread, this is the game from which Lisa and I developed the Berengad setting that we then used in <b>Beast Hunters</b>. Initially we had an empty map for players to place their own societies and explore after the Cwencan, and when this game didn't come to fruition, we just developed the world on our own.)<br/><br/>Nowadays, I still think there is a place for such a game out there, but it's harder because many people find context for their freeform play in MMORPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95879/#Comment_95879" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T08:43:27+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  8:43AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>Nowadays, I still think there is a place for such a game out there, but it's harder because many people find context for their freeform play in MMORPGs.</blockquote>\nTangental, and possibly worthy of a separate thread, my biggest problem with MMORPGs (and whether they express that way or not, the problem others I've talked to seem to have) is the MASSIVELY part.  Whether it is out-of-character play, player bordering on (or outrightly) offensive, or the destruction of illusion that my character has a meaningful impact on the world, the more players can equal less appealling.<br/><br/>Another idea I've toyed with in the past is that of a minorly Multiplayer On-line RPG (mMORPG).  The original soliciatations for Neverwinter Nights gave me hope such things.
