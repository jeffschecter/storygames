I want to follow up on that idea.<br/><br/>I encountered this problem over twenty years ago when I started working on Matrix games. I would say something like "Make an argument for what you want to have happen next." and people would give me blank looks. It was like I'd spoken Greek. But when I reframed the question they were able to do the task easily. I'd say "If this were any other game, this was the situation, you were your character and you could do anything, what would you want to do first?"<br/><br/>Interestingly after the first turn I could say "What happens next?" and they had no trouble making up the next scene. <br/><br/>It became clear to me that people under went a mental systems shift. <br/><br/>Once they had made the shift they could play story games until then they couldn't. I believe this is what Ron Edwards was describing when he said traditional RPGs caused brain damage. Trad games teach a process where the GM describes the situation, the players can only say what their character does and the GM narrates what happens. The GM is the main player. The players are largely an audience. I never agreed with what I though Ron was saying because I think people can be taught the system shift. <br/><br/>What I'd like to explore in this thread are ways people walk people though the different mental shifts story gamers go through to be able to play. <br/><br/>My day job becons me now so I'll get back to this later with an example of how I do this with Matrix games. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299719/#Comment_299719" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T06:32:29+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  6:32AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So my theory is that people need to make a mental shift to play story games. Trad games teach players to be more audience than active participant in scene staging, stakes setting and most narration. With board games players are taught that they can only do things that are within the rules. You can't make things up as you go along. Of course we know that you can do that and that it is very fun.<br/><br/>Since it is a mental systems shift you need to keep things simple. Put forward too many rules and players get confused and shut down. I've seen my wife do this many times when confronted with new games. There need to be very few barriers to frighten them off. <br/><br/>The shift I'm shooting for is to get people making up scenes and to contradict one another. I have one player assigned the role "game host" who is also the referee. The host read a script to guide the players through the game.<br/><br/>The host picks a player to go first. "Bob - Tell us what happens next?" On Bob's first turn the host offers more encouragement, like "Tell us what your character does when he gets to the house?" Whatever Bob says is his first scene (or rather the fragment of a scene). By making this up Bob is beginning to think differently about the game. He made up the narrative rather than the host. <br/><br/>The host decides what Bob has to roll or less on 2d6 for the action to happen. The default roll is 7 so new hosts don't have to know what they are doing at first either. When they feel more confident in their rulings they can move the number up or down. <br/><br/>The turn could end here but I want players to know they don't have to agree with one another so the host asks "Does anyone want to make a counter-argument to this?" If a player does, they make an alternative version of the scene. They also get to roll. As many players as want may join in this pissing match. The ones that pass the first roll get to make a second roll. The high roller is the one whose version happens.<br/><br/>That is a very simple procedure (I think). I don't tell them that players can build on one another's scene instead of contradict them. I don't mention that the host can decide to let all the counter-arguments happen without a second roll. I don't tell them that the host can also run a character (he just picks a different player to be his referee). I don't tell them that the host can pass on the referee job to other players. And I especially don't tell them about how to run criminal trials, handle secret actions, or counteract trouble. All that flexibility would just confuse them. <br/><br/>After they have played a few games with the basic format they will be ready to add in the variations on the theme - but not until then. <br/><br/>So how would you go about doing stakes setting in say Dogs?<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calithena" title="Calithena"><img alt="Calithena" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calithena">Calithena</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299747/#Comment_299747" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T08:35:36+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  8:35AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chris,<br/>\n<br/>\nAn interesting distinction I got out of your post, which I will not attempt to theoretically locate at all, goes like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n- In much standard-as-I-have-observed-it RPG play, there is tight control over what gets introduced into the shared imagined space. Typically there is a GM who handles most of this control and player inputs are either through shared mechanics (the system lets me input this if I make a roll) and/or GM permission (it's understood that at any time player inputs can be vetoed or restricted if they don't fit the integrity). The GM's job is preserving the integrity of the shared imagined space.<br/>\n<br/>\n- It is possible to play RPGs or RPG-like games in which this control is weakened, in a variety of ways. One way, which you describe, is for multiple players and/or the GM (if there even is one) to all propose alternate contents/stories/frames for scenes and to roll that off directly, or put it up to a vote, or have those who do not propose dispose, etc. The construction of the SIS is not filtered through a GM figure so much as put out there as open content for the group to negotiate, and/or for system elements to deal with integration problems directly rather than through the lens of 'what can my character do now?' for players and everything else for GMs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is your point I would agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299760/#Comment_299760" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T09:56:46+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  9:56AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I observed such a paradigm shift at Ice Station Nerdly - Adam Dray had to remind one of the players that games like <i>My Life With Master</i> and <i>Dogs</i> run on player input and agency. There would be the player, expectantly waiting for Adam (the gm) to give input in a particular way, and then Adam would consciously ignore the trad-gamer social cue and instead further complicate the situation. <br>Eventually, Adam or one of the other players (me or Brian) would say something along the lines of "hey, man, this part is up to us, the players!" At which point there'd be a sort of "Oh, really? Hm, okay, then... [almost immediately] how about this?"<br><br>This sort of thing highlights the intense importance of procedural text, of very clearly establishing who says and does what, when. If it's hand-waved, or not really covered effectively, then it's up to the play group; this is not an inherently bad thing, but games like Dogs really, really rely on giving the final say about, f'rex, the nature of demons, to the players, and NOT to the gm. <br><br>Chris, I think that board games can teach us a lot about good, solid procedural text, but I fully agree that a little improv, a little color here and there, has to happen. I think Vincent is really onto something when he talks about making sure that player input meaningfully affects both the fiction and the play procedures - but of late, I admit I'm willing to sacrifice some of the "screen time" that Color gets for the sake of nailing the procedures perfectly.<br><br> It's a wiggly balance to strike - running Chronica last night, working with a brand-new RPer, I intervened several times to point out when we were "just narrating" and when we had to use the rules - it came down to spelling out when you pick up the dice. Chronica handles this pretty well, although it does call for some artfulness - it tells you to pick up the dice whenever a character tries to do something "difficult, dangerous, or daring". Pretty standard, yes, but it's specific enough that the game doesn't ask you to "just know" when a conflict begins. <br><br/>On the OSR - Where Do We Go From Here thread, I think that's where someone said the middle editions of D&amp;D contain lots of rules and tables that are devoid of procedural text. This is the sort of thing that was my bane in middle school, demanding that I infer without any outside guidance (social or textual) how the bloody hell to play the thing. It was totally unclear how to frame an adventure, using only the text of AD&amp;D 2e, how to start a campaign, what the campaign should be about... it was confusing enough that I briefly considered that you were supposed to only play modules each session, until my mom (ah, my mom) insisted that buying modules would cost too much money, and my friends and I were imaginative enough without that.<br/><br/>This led, again, without any real guidance, to games that consisted entirely of combats, games that quickly disintegrated due to lack of investment in the activity. In Everway, for chrissake, there was enough of an idea of what to do that we picked powers, the GM threw problems our way, and we thrashed around in Exploration, seeing where things went. AD&amp;D2 failed us as far as presenting, clearly, what were were supposed to be doing. I had similar problems with 2nd ed. Werewolf and Mage, and 3rd ed. Vampire - we had plenty of essays to read on what sorts of themes and moods to cover once play got going, and that all made sense, but as far as what we should DO, we just scratched our heads and went with whatever stream of consciousness plot we could devise. <br/><br/>I, as resident GM, eventually devised elaborate plots for the players to explore, but these ended up being metaplot-style play - the players did as they wished, I didn't railroad them much at all, and I tried to introduce cool ideas I'd had, when I could. The net effect was a bunch of random Tzimisce beasties running around, dream sequences, and off-label applications of Disciplines, while the players had fun killing stuff and staying well-fed. It was enjoyable, but it was a lot more spastic and random than, perhaps, was intended.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299823/#Comment_299823" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T13:45:18+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  1:45PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Calithena - You've perfectly understood my rules teach - which shows how this stripped down simplified approach can teach a concept and walk people through a mental shift.

They do that in spades - but often as the expense of flexibility. I enjoy a good game of Diplomacy but it is limited. <br/><br/>Thanks for the first hand experiences with the various games. There is a lot of truth to the observation that we all had to figure out how to make RPGs work so there are thousands of different RPG cargo cults out there.

It got me thinking about how many RPG texts are examples of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge" rel="nofollow">tacit knowledge</a>.  There is an implication that you will "get it" by playing the game repeatedly.  I would relate this to the hackneyed metaphor that often gets used is that of the band.  The GM is the bass player and the players are the other musicians who improvise around him/her.  Well, I play music (not wonderfully, but I did get paid \xa350 for a gig once) and to reach a standard to improvise effectively takes enormous practice.  Additionally, it seems important for a musician of that level to "know" what the other musicians are about.  If that musical analogy is the analogy that is being offered then I would say I am a punk.  I want to plug in turn up the amp to 11 while someone else beats the living crap out of the drums and if we start and finish the song at the same time then that is a victory.<br/><br/>Another way I would frame it is perhaps I would like to learn to play better.  I can practice on my own - something I'm planning to do having recently bought Mythic for its solo potential - and at last I might be able to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky" rel="nofollow">Tarkovsky</a> RPG experience.  I can learn from others, either through play or by asking questions.  The other option is to request greater clarity from game designers.  <br/><br/>A great designer does not a good explainer make.  Would it not be useful in the process of writing the rulebook to get someone in who either played only a mainstream game, such as D&amp;D or someone who had never played anything before just for proofreading?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300344/#Comment_300344" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T20:03:42+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  8:03PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>Danny - Can you tell us more on how this is done?

An example character gets made up at every stage of the process, which helps clear things up.  <br/>But I was thinking specifically about the "initiation conflict" part of chargen where you say something about your guy like "I hope my character exorcised a demon" or "I hope my character learned to shoot straight" and you use the conflict system right then and there versus the GM to find out whether they did or not -- and afterwards you get a Trait on your character sheet, either "I exorcised a demon" or "A demon got the best of me."  <br/><br/>It's about as close to "tutorial mode" in CRPG's as I've ever seen in a PnP game, and I can't understand why nobody else uses it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300351/#Comment_300351" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T21:54:47+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  9:54PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite><br/>It's about as close to "tutorial mode" in CRPG's as I've ever seen in a PnP game, and I can't understand why nobody else uses it.</blockquote>\nWell, because, as far as it's function as a tutorial, you only really want to do it once.  Consider something like Portal, where the first few levels function as tutorial for the game.  The first time it's fantastic, the second time it's dreadfully boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300365/#Comment_300365" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T05:27:26+00:00" title="November 11, 2010  5:27AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the music analogy but I don't think it is necessarily true of role play games. Certainly high level really kick ass play it is but I think that there is also middle level (let's call it board game) play that is pretty standard that doesn't require virtuosity. <br/><br/>The Dogs example fits this. One doesn't need to be great to do it and have fun but it does require the players to think about play in a different way - like the mental shift I stive for in Matrix games. If the rules just assume that you will "get" the basic level of play  by repeated play but don't tell you how to do basic play well enough to play the first game then it all falls down.<br/><br/>Great designers may not be great explainers but if they aren't then they should hook up with a great explainer as a co-author because without that the game may never get played. It's like a great TV show that gets cancelled mid season. (For example - Caprica. A very slow show. I enjoyed it but now it's cancelled. Fuck!)<br/><br/>Getting a D+D player to do the play testing and proof reading is intriguing. Just imagine what the RPGPundit would come up with...<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300636/#Comment_300636" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T15:16:12+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  3:16PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, <br/>It might make sense for Designer to talk to his/her more hard-core number-crunching/system-breaking friends, get THEM to write the tutorial text, and then Designer can come back and just edit it and send it to print. <br/>I agree that good design is not the same as good explanation, just like good play is not the same as either. But get enough different types of brains in the kitchen, and surely something useful and/or delicious will be the result.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
