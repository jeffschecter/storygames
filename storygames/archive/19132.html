I just found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation_(magic)#Magician.27s_Choice" rel="nofollow">a useful definition</a>, and it got me thinking -- what's bad about this?  In a game where players are invested in driving the story with their decisions, and they think that's what's going on, then a GM offering a magician's choice is being deceptive and robbing the players' decisions of their oomph, right?  But hold on a sec.  If, as a player, magician's choices have any prayer of <i>working</i> on you, that means that the connection between your choice and the outcome is already hidden, and thus you will <i>never</i> get the desired oomph <i>directly</i>.  Instead, you will get it via the GM -- "Because you guys chose to investigate the mansion, not the crypt, you're finding all these macabre secrets in the mansion!  Well-chosen, players!"  If <i>that's</i> how your choices pay off, then does it actually <i>matter</i> whether or not the GM was going to just place the macabre secrets wherever you went, crypt or mansion?<br/><br/>The <i>implied</i> meaning in the choice is usually something like, "Prioritize squashing the threats emanating from the crypt, or those emanating from the mansion?  Which sounds worse, and needs stopping now, while you leave the other to fester and grow?"  But really, without further info on the consequences of "What'll happen if we don't address the crypt's threat?", what may <i>look</i> like a highly random strategic character decision is <i>actually</i> just a player flavor decision.  "Which sounds cooler to y'all as the setting for the investigation -- a crypt or a mansion?"  The GM <i>could</i> just say this, rather than offering the magician's choice, but players who are already immersed/in-character/whatever often <i>prefer</i> choosing their path without jumping up to the meta level.  Magician's choice, it seems to me, is largely a matter of taste.  Do we prefer a moment of deception so we don't have to break character, or would we rather drop the illusion and tell it like it is?  Different strokes for different folks, and agendas, and games.<br/><br/>I mentioned "info on consequences" above, and I think this is key.  If the players choose to address "mansion" because the mansion threatens the town, and the crypt threatens the village, and the players care more about the town than the village, then <i>that</i> choice <i>should</i> have consequences, right?  A magician's choice there would suck, right?  Well, yes, but a magician's choice there also <i>won't work</i>.  If you go to save the town, and then it turns out the village is fine too, then it becomes totally <i>obvious</i> that your choice had no meaning.  This isn't magic being bad; this is just bad magic.<br/><br/>If everything I've said is already perfectly obvious to everyone who cares, then I guess this doesn't deserve a thread.  But it wasn't obvious to <i>me</i> from seeing the term used on Story Games, so I wanted to broach the topic.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427036/#Comment_427036" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T01:50:44+00:00" title="January 12, 2014  1:50AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wonder how this differs from illusionism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427039/#Comment_427039" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T03:33:48+00:00" title="January 12, 2014  3:33AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is an illusionistic technique, so it doesn't differ from illusionism.<br/><br/>As I understand it, David's point is that a correctly performed illusionist technique leaves the other players with the impression that you followed procedure, when you actually didn't. I don't disagree. However, you might still be losing something in comparison to procedurally correct play, especially over the long term.<br/><br/>I've noticed that one of the important things we do in games where we care about procedural hygiene is what might be termed "trust-developing exercises": when the GM is actually running the game according to procedure, they'll be overt about what they're doing, and they'll let the players have the occasional peek at the secret elements. The purpose of this pretty natural and instinctive behavior is to maintain oversight and increase trust in the GM's play being above-board.<br/><br/>For example, in a drama game like <i>Dust Devils</i> it is not uncommon for me to remind the players of the creative basis I use when making dealer calls; for instance, when a dramatic coincidence happens, I tell the players that it's a dramatic "coincidence" (that is, an overt dealer choice), that I arbitrarily chose because it helps us bring dramatic values into confrontation. I could do this because it's my right according to the rules to do it, and by reminding the players of the decision-making heuristic I increase confidence in the fact that I'm not picking on individual players for laughs, or rolling dice to determine what happens, or anything of the sort. Likewise, in D&amp;D I roll random encounter checks in the open, with the players knowing that it's 1/6 per half hour or whatever; by making this overt I increase faith in the system and my role as a GM.<br/><br/>Now you'll see my point: the magician, even if they're formally perfect, has difficulties with these informal trust-building elements of the exercise, simply because they don't actually deserve the trust. The rules don't <i>say</i> that they'd ever have to show their work, but the fact remains that if their work cannot be brought into daylight without ruining it, they'll be sure to keep a much tighter lid than an honest GM with nothing to hide. This "tighter ship" that the magician runs (we all know it well: GM screens, consistently secret dicing, refusal to discuss the basis of decisions made) is overtly supposed to still run by the rules, but it is unavoidable that the level of trust the players have in the magician is less than the trust an honest GM manages to win by being available for scrutiny at any time. If your players are even a little bit cynical, they'll spot the magician's ship from a mile away by the general lack of transparency.<br/><br/>(All this is actually very important and practical theory for the sort of old school D&amp;D we've been playing around here lately. The GM who lies in this sort of game would be under such immense pressure all the time that I would never want to be in those boots, dying little deaths every time anything "unlikely" or "surprisingly convenient" occurs. The honest GM with nothing to hide not only doesn't need to worry about scrutiny, but they can also provide constant little proofs about their honesty by showing the players how they execute the procedures of play.)<br/><br/>Thus my thesis: it is true that magician's choice is impossible to distinguish on a case-by-case basis when performed correctly, but it's still going to be distinguished by the general ethos of the table over a longer period of time, so we can't say that it is just the same if you had played it right. It's like many vices: immediate consequences are not much, but by engaging the vice you're harming yourself as a virtuous person, which will transform the nature of your future interactions bit by bit.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_427040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427040/#Comment_427040" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T05:27:43+00:00" title="January 12, 2014  5:27AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But the real question is whether the Magician's Choice really DOES constitute a violation of trust.

Will the GM be uncomfortable if a player asks, "Wow, I knew the clue would be in the manor all along, because of that clever hint you dropped at the beginning of the game"? How will she answer? Suddenly our social interactions are on somewhat shaky ground, and over time that can grow and have unexpected repercussions. (If the GM in the example doesn't reveal the truth, there will now be some pressure on her to do the same next time, or two reveal her earlier lie, and so forth.)<br/><br/>Another issue, though, is that I'd consider a situation like that to be bad (or at least inefficient) game design/adventure design. I'm going to offer the players a choice between the manor and the crypt, but not go the extra step to add some kind of interesting consequence to the choice? It seems like very half-assed scenario design, with wasted effort on a pointless decision, whereas the important data ("how is this choice meaningful?") appears to have been left in the dust. That's an odd thing to do, I think, and pretty counter-productive.<br/><br/>I can see an interesting half-way version which I would find OK, however: the GM tells the group that this is how they operate before the game starts, but, during the game, the illusion stands. "Don't ask, don't tell" holds while the action is going down, to maintain the sense of flow and the illusion of consistency, but everyone's making that choice willingly, as a group. But that doesn't address the second point I made: I'd still consider an error a skilled GM/group shouldn't have to make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427052/#Comment_427052" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T10:14:57+00:00" title="January 12, 2014 10:14AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Typically I find it happens when a game that was previously about exploration becomes about experience. For example, in Dragonlance, the Magician's Choice is used a lot of the time, which is fine if you're all there to play the Dragonlance story but it's not fine if you're all there to explore the Dragonlance world. Shifting between these two goals is where the problem happens.  If you're exploring the Dragonlance world, even a seemingly random choice (which of two unknown roads to travel down, for example) should be strictly adhered to: if the party goes down a boring road to snoresville, the GM should diligently report nothing happening and the interminable tedium of this choice, and the players should high-five each other and expand the map they're working on. "We discovered this fork in the road was boring and nothing is happening on it! ALL RIGHT!! I LOVE RPGS!! I absolutely CANNOT WAIT to come back next week."  <br/><br/>But if they're not there just to explore, if they want to have something happen, the Magician's Choice makes it so.<br/><br/>Here's an illustration, normally a module with this kind of event says something like:<br/><br/>"Whether the players go east or west, the wizard Tricky Steve approaches on the road after they've traveled several miles."<br/><br/>What if instead it said:<br/><br/>"The wizard Tricky Steve approaches the players a few hours after they leave town."<br/><br/>Is this still a Magician's Choice?  Only if the players think that they are exploring and their directional choices matter to what will happen to them. <br/><br/>Another interesting thought: if Tricky Steve is powerful enough, in D&amp;D, the Magician's Choice goes away, since he can just teleport to you or wish that he was where you were. If the module, or perhaps the GM, never tells you how powerful Tricky Steve is, does knowing that the system permits certain characters to do exactly what the GM portrays Tricky Steve as doing make things different?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427053/#Comment_427053" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T10:20:18+00:00" title="January 12, 2014 10:20AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I feel like illusionism is not always an issue of "fun vs  not fun" or "honest vs dishonest" (although in a dysfunctional group, this is usually the case).<br/>But, instead, it is an issue of player vs GM buy-in. So, it is bad when the GM uses this technique and the players are not aware of it. Even players who prefer this style of play will object to it on occasion when it is used unannounced. The trick is that the choices that the players make for their characters are the player's only meaningful contribution to the game.<br/>On the other hand, when the players know that this technique is in play, then they can make an informed decision as to whether that style fo play is for them or not. To be clear, I am not saying the GM should be like, guys, I am about to do Magician's Choice on you, FYI. But instead when the GM is pitching a new game and peeps are making characters, the GM can let them know that because of the prep they are planning, they may need to give the characters rails on occasion. Again, this just has to do with the fact that deciding what their character does is all the a player gets to do in most games, right?<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427054/#Comment_427054" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T10:21:37+00:00" title="January 12, 2014 10:21AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero said<br/>Thus my thesis: it is true that magician's choice is impossible to distinguish on a case-by-case basis when performed correctly, but it's still going to be distinguished by the general ethos of the table over a longer period of time, so we can't say that it is just the same if you had played it right.

I think JD's point about "type of game" is key -- Eero's concerns are absolutely make-or-break in a game where the GM is tasked with providing fair opposition, and pretty irrelevant in a game where the players are there to revel in madness or superheroism.<br/><br/>I agree with Dave M that GMs ought to announce "illusion in effect, okay?" before adopting the magician's choice technique, but I'd also say that players shouldn't sweat or argue the outcomes of meaningless decisions.  If you don't have the info to make any sort of informed choice, pick at random and proceed.  If that sort of decision is <i>all</i> you get, then yeah, that's awful GMing or scenario design, but if just comes up occasionally, it doesn't have to be a big deal.<br/><br/>I should note that, as a player, I personally do <i>not</i> always rush through meaningless decisions, but that's because I sometimes enjoy roleplaying them.  It can be a fun time for the characters to bounce off each other, establish whether we go boldly or timidly, etc.  But this investment in the <i>experience</i> of the decision should not be mistaken for any sort of contract that our choice will make any difference to the adventure.<br/><br/>As a GM, given a group tolerance/preference for imperfect transparency, it seems to me that the primary rule should not be "don't offer false <i>choices</i>", but rather "don't offer false <i>rewards</i>".  If you allow/encourage the players to believe that a choice will matter in a certain way, then it'd better do that (just as DavidVS pointed out re: PC fighting style).  Otherwise, do what ya like*.<br/><br/>* Unless, y'know, your players don't enjoy meaningless choices but compulsively drag them out anyway, in which case I guess you might take it upon yourself to avoid that.  But I wouldn't lay the blame for compulsive players at the GM's doorstep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427078/#Comment_427078" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T21:54:38+00:00" title="January 12, 2014  9:54PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2014 9:55PM by Rickard.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On the other hand, when the players know that this technique is in play, then they can make an informed decision as to whether that style fo play is for them or not.

But instead when the GM is pitching a new game and peeps are making characters, the GM can let them know that because of the prep they are planning, they may need to give the characters rails on occasion.</blockquote>\nI think this is wise. Another thing that is important to keep it in mind is to not rub it in the players faces. "Haha, it didn't really matter what you did." That isn't a good social behavior to start with.<br/><br/>One thing I tend to strive for is to make the players feel smart. So I can move my scenario to fit their ideas. I also do that to make things flow in a better manner. Sure, I could adopt to the players ideas but that will create consequences. In the same manner, I could render the players' choices useless by using illusionary techniques.<br/><br/>What's really the difference between me forcing my ideas on my players or having written consequences in the scenario? What's the difference between having person NN being a werewolf - and when the players doing wrong, showing them the consequences - and me leaving it open in the scenario who's the werewolf and then show the players the consequence of being wrong. The latter renders the players' choices useless but I would do that to create a flow and mostly because I wanted the scenario to be a in a certain way and I wanted some moments to happen to bring the right atmosphere. Perhaps I had planned that the death of the grandpa would release some strong emotional moments? Should I play the scenario and hope that they would guess wrong or should I plan for it? Because sometimes, all you want is to give the players a <i>sensation</i>.<br/><br/>I wouldn't rub in their faces afterwords that it didn't matter what they did, the werewolf would still eat the grandpa. That would still be a part of the scenario. What would instead change is who's the werewolf. I would tell the players that it would be railroady in the beginning of the session, but I would still make it look like they had choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427086/#Comment_427086" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-13T07:13:59+00:00" title="January 13, 2014  7:13AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a little confused about the terminology, actually. This <i>seems</i> to be about the phenomenon I'd call "Schroedinger's Room", where preplanned plot elements are not fixed in place until observed by the players. The term "Magician's Choice" gives me another mental image, however, possibly because I've casually dipped into close-up magic over the years and am very familiar with how a Magician's Choice actually works. :-)<br/><br/>A real-life Magician's Choice is about tricking players into choosing one specific outcome through disorientation. (Truth be told, I don't like saying even that much; it's a magician quirk, even for those who aren't super-dedicated. But then again, you can find umpteen places telling you how the Magician's Choice works.) It works because of ambiguity and momentary choice, and doesn't work on every person.<br/><br/>That is to say, with a group of seasoned RPG players, you would <b>never</b> manage an actual Magician's Choice.<br/><br/>Sorry, that's a bit of a tangent and my two cents. I just find the terminology to be confusing. I tend to prefer above-the-board negotiation, not using techniques like this to jockey to the position everyone wants. It's like when Vincent Baker talks about not keeping secrets in Dogs in the Vineyard: if not knowing information is hindering the objective of the game, then either it's not important to hide that information or you're seeding the information wrong. (There's a bunch of habits regarding how you sew information in investigative games that I have problems with.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427100/#Comment_427100" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-13T11:39:45+00:00" title="January 13, 2014 11:39AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw c'mon Carpe, that's pretty much the first card trick every kid ever learns.

You interpret the audience's input in the way that you want it to. If they point to the card you want them to have, then you say "Okay, that's your card!" If they point to the card you don't want them to have, then you say "Okay, then we'll discard this card!"<br/><br/>You need to run it slickly and never run it twice. You can usually Magician's Choice out of a larger number of cards if you vary up the method used to narrow down their options. So you have them pick a number once, then you start counting piles so that you'll wind up on the pile that has the card you want to give them. Or you have them pick evens or odds, and use that to eliminate cards.<br/><br/>In gaming terms, the Magician's Choice would be deliberately misinterpreting any player decisions which run counter to the outcome you want to give them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427111/#Comment_427111" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-13T13:49:56+00:00" title="January 13, 2014  1:49PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was seeing it as the plot remains the same no matter if you pick the mansion or the crypt. your still going to play with the plot I have predetermined.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ToddSpengo" title="ToddSpengo"><img alt="ToddSpengo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ToddSpengo">ToddSpengo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427127/#Comment_427127" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-13T18:44:49+00:00" title="January 13, 2014  6:44PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would think that one effect of using the Magician's Choice would be a vast reduction in unexpected outcomes, at least on a macro level.

It's one game where I know I've used Magician's Choice at times in the past as GM. It's a quick and dirty patch to move a clue to another place rather than to require to much backtracking by PCs. Or, y'know, just make up another similar clue to find.<br/><br/>ToC gets somewhat around this by it's investigative skill system. OTOH, it to will eventually get you to one (of several possible) outcomes.<br/><br/>In both cases, there are plenty of ways to get where you're going, different details as you get to the end of the thing, and ways that player decisions do in fact matter. OTOH, everyone came, presumably, for an investigation culminating in some sort of resolution, usually involving some kind of showdown/tense climax/whatever.<br/><br/>Magician's Choice in the situation of CoC going way off mark is a tool for getting things back where they need to be, crude but valuable.<br/><br/>I guess MC could be valuable in pretty much anything that involves an investigation or some kind of one-shot that you want to wrap up after x amount of time, especially with some kind of showdown.<br/><br/>I doubt it would be your first choice, however.

First, if the person whose fun was predicated on believing they made meaningful contributions finds out that they really <i>didn't</i> then their past fun gets deflated. Second, training yourself to view others' contributions as worthless can be a dangerous habit that manifests even when you don't want it to. Third, forcing yourself to provide fake acknowledgement of things you believe are meaningless is effortful work (notice that a lot of people report a burnout problem with illusionist GMing). Fourth, if you are actively concealing and misdirecting where <i>your</i> meaningful contributions are coming into the game then the odds are high that your contributions won't get recognized or appreciated, which can also be draining.<br/><br/>Generally speaking it seems like it would just be simpler to play games where people's contributions are transparently meaningful, then everyone can just express genuine appreciation if and when they feel it, rather than be obligated to provide a constant stream of pleasing deception to everyone else. That would require the games to be designed to facilitate that, though. The PTA example is good in that it shows that players can be synchronized on how meaningful something should be, e.g. the location of a scene in a game that's using TV conventions is mostly about background color, and neither the player or GM treat it as more or less weighty than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427188/#Comment_427188" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-15T12:14:54+00:00" title="January 15, 2014 12:14PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me just say that seeing the pros and cons of Illusionism being debated seems weird to me, but it could be that I'm just old.

Perhaps it's now an "experience", and the players see value in that, but even if so, IMO you're addressing needs that are better met with other media: movies, TV, theater, books, comics, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427189/#Comment_427189" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-15T13:44:19+00:00" title="January 15, 2014  1:44PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2014 1:56PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, "warn people before you get all illusionist" is good advice and old news.  However, I think magician's choice specifically is a different issue than illusionism generally, because it could be argued that problems in play occur not <i>just</i> because a GM forces a magician's choice on their players, but because players fail to distinguish meaningful from irrelevant choices even when that information <i>is</i> available.\n<blockquote>Generally speaking it seems like it would just be simpler to play games where people's contributions are transparently meaningful</blockquote>There's a reason why this isn't happening, and that's kind of my point.  Once you endow the fiction with causal power, stuff's gonna crop up that the game is agnostic on.  A good RPG supports meaningful decisions, yes, but those game-supported decisions are never the <i>only</i> ones the players will be making.<br/><br/>What's necessary, it seems to me, is some sort of methodology or attitude to distinguish which choices deserve which treatments.  I suggest looking to rewards -- if the system doesn't offer any, and the GM doesn't offer any, then the choice is arbitrary and should be treated as such.  Magician's choice strikes me as a fine way to handle arbitrary choices -- it may be so non-problematic, in fact, that up-front transparency may not even be needed.\n<blockquote>Games are fundamentally about the choices available to the participants; remove those choices ("deprotagonize" or "deny player agency", depending on your age) and we have to question whether it's even a game any more. Perhaps it's now an "experience", and the players see value in that, but even if so, IMO you're addressing needs that are better met with other media: movies, TV, theater, books, comics, etc.</blockquote>For players who agree with this, the issue is pretty straightforward.  Engage with the truly meaningful choices, don't sweat the rest.<br/><br/>However, I think the desire for "RPG as experience" is a <i>huge</i> part of why many people engage in RPGs.  Certainly a lot of people I know.  It's not that big choices cease to be important, it's just that spending some time on experience is <i>also</i> important, and little choices like "how would my character comment on this situation?" become relevant.<br/><br/>The desire to interact with the fiction in a certain way, whether the focus be virtual experience, colorful narration, leisurely character exploration, immersion, simulation or experiment, leads many a group to the fork in the road between crypt and mansion thinking "this matters" even when it doesn't.  I suppose one could task the GM with making <i>every</i> choice meaningful, so the players don't have to break immersion or whatever to speed through the arbitrary ones, but that doesn't seem quite fair to me.<br/><br/>Perhaps there could be a rule that governs this part of the conversation?  Could "we're sweating an uninformed choice" trigger some procedure that satisfyingly resolves it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427194/#Comment_427194" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-15T16:10:33+00:00" title="January 15, 2014  4:10PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's a reason why this isn't happening</blockquote>\nMore than one, and not the one you seem to assume, but I don't think I can respond in more depth without getting snarky, so I'll need to drop out of the thread in order to satisfy my self-imposed no-snark rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427196/#Comment_427196" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-15T17:09:47+00:00" title="January 15, 2014  5:09PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2014 5:31PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why would this be a cause for snark?

Now, unlike in the MC example, there probably is a real difference between left and right, since there is an objective dungeon map to consult. But the issue *is* similar in that sometimes people simply don't know enough to understand when there simply aren't enough meaningful clues to make an informed decision.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427203/#Comment_427203" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-15T18:58:11+00:00" title="January 15, 2014  6:58PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2014 7:00PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally.

In a video game you have only so many options, but in an RPG you can create your own options.  "Crypt or mansion?" may be arbitrary, but that fact may not stop the players from trying to do something clever like summon a minion to bring a walkie-talkie to the path not chosen, so the PCs can keep tabs on both, or what have you.  Which is awesome!  I suspect that's part of why Tavis allows the Red Box folks all the time they want.  But not every such creative problem-solving effort bears fruit, and that standard becomes a problem if employed habitually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427209/#Comment_427209" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-15T22:35:05+00:00" title="January 15, 2014 10:35PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that, in a "Red Box"-style game (I feel comfortable making this vague statement because I've played with Tavis, and I'm pretty sure we're on the same page here), there is no such thing as an arbitrary decision. In the hardcore OSR-type play, any misstep can mean death. Yes, sometimes the players don't have enough information to make that decision intelligently, but the outcome will certainly be different (potentially lethally so!). There's no question of the GM later deciding to shift things around so that the choice wasn't important after all.<br/><br/>Yes, sometimes it's entirely possible that the players will waste time on a decision that ultimately isn't important, simply because they didn't know that the two corridors they were investigating actually form a loop, and they'll have to traverse the trap in the middle of the loop no matter whether they go left or right. But I don't see what that has to do with the "Magician's Choice" at all! It seems like a totally separate topic ("If one player knows that a presumably important choice being made by the group actually *isn't*, should they speak up in order to save the group the trouble - even though it goes against the regular procedures of play?").<br/><br/>But maybe I'm just not getting this!

As a player, spending an hour prepping how to enter a room that turns out to be empty is a major bummer.  Better for the GM to just shift the interesting content into the chosen room.  It seems to me that, with the right attitude on the players' part, Tavis would be free to do this, and I don't see any downsides.

I find it hard to imagine how a GM could do the sort of jury-rigging you're describing without losing the impartiality necessary to GM in that style. (As a simple example, if you've got some bad guys waiting two rooms further along, but the room is long and narrow, when you move them into this closer, round room, where will you place them? Can you make that decision in some sensible and fair <i>even though</i> you've just heard the players' plan for the attack? Maybe... but it's quite a juggling act, and threatens the entire contract of play in that style, I would think.)<br/><br/>In these situations, I've seen more luck dealing with it on the players' side: they can simply now use that same march order/room entry technique on the next room, verbatim, once it's revealed that <i>this</i> room is empty.

The point being, you're only correct about illusionism being "participationism done bad" if lying to the other players is bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427228/#Comment_427228" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T05:58:04+00:00" title="January 16, 2014  5:58AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, it might be worth dissecting <i>why</i> this technique came to be used.<br/><br/>Let's assume no malice was intended.

That is, the label does not describe any difference in action, but only in perception.<br/><br/>However, I have some shocking news for you.  You know when you see a movie, and some guy gets shot?  Well, that's not real blood, and the guy didn't actually die.<br/><br/>Some degree of "deception" is not at all unusual in the performance of many kinds of art.  In fact, we recognise that in these other forms, that act of "deception" is one of the things that contributes to the value of the experience; nor do we accuse the performers who carry out these "deceptions" of bearing ill-will toward their audiences.  Now you can cogently argue that RPG's are a different form and may procede differently, but it can simply be assumed as axiomatic that any form of "deception" is inherently and automatically a bad, abusive thing.<br/><br/><i>\u201cArt is the most beautiful deception of all. And although people try to incorporate the everyday events of life in it, we must hope that it will remain a deception lest it become a utilitarian thing, sad as a factory.\u201d</i><br/>- Claude Debussy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427231/#Comment_427231" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T07:27:17+00:00" title="January 16, 2014  7:27AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The deception in illusionism is not artistic in nature, though. Or rather, there is that sort of deception as well in rpgs (and not just illusionist ones, either), but the type of deception that gets some people's hackles up is better compared to cheating in a game than willing suspension of disbelief in a movie. The objectionable bit is not when the GM e.g. misleads one to think that the wrong guy was the murderer; the objection comes in when we're supposedly playing a game with objective scenarios with win and loss conditions, but in reality the GM is fudging dice or pre-empting choices behind his screen to create the mere illusion of interactive, consequential action. The former is artistic deception, the latter is breaking rules, at least the rules that the player thinks the game runs by. (The sad truth is that we have a rich tradition of double-faced rpg texts that say multiple things about the nature of the game, leaving everybody to form their own opinions, often so that players of the game intentionally have an incomplete picture of what the GM is actually doing. I imagine that participationism would be more common, and illusionism less so, if game texts were clearer about these things.)<br/><br/>A simple gut-check that anybody can use to distinguish between artistic deception and lying about the game you play: if your mark actually knows and tacitly participates in the illusion you depict, then it's a participationist activity, and as Gareth says, common in the arts; willing suspension of disbelief, as it's often called. However, if your secrets are of such nature that you don't dare reveal them, because their existence would be considered a betrayal by your audience, and your craft would no longer be respected if it became known that you cheat, then chances are that you're doing illusionism. By this measure it's easy to see that fake violence in movies is benign - it surprises nobody that it's fake, nobody gets angry at being led by the nose, nobody needs to revise their understanding of their movie-watching hobby because they'd completely misunderstood the entire thing. Also by this same measure we can see that the dice fudging in e.g. Tri-Stat games is illusionist: the parts of the rules that the players are reasonably expected to read depict a game that is different from the one the GM is guided to run, and the GM is instructed to hide his dice fudging from the players to preserve their (misplaced) trust in the GM's fairness.<br/><br/>But yes, this was what I was getting at above: illusionism is only "participationism done badly" if you think that lying to the other players about the rules and procedures of the game is inherently bad. If one is willing to accept that sometimes deception is good, then I guess illusionism can be defended as well.<br/><br/>And of course, if anybody thinks that this is a harsh characterization of illusionism: you don't <i>have</i> to defend an empty word, you can just say that OK, apparently Eero insists on using this word for something so stupid that I've never done anything like that myself. Fair enough, and maybe all your play is participationist, then. That's <i>exactly</i> why the distinction between these two concepts was coined, so we could talk about consensual illusionism separately from the other kind. (Also, it goes without saying that I don't really care about the <i>words</i> themselves; if it bothers anybody that I'm maligning a word they like, we can use different words. Sometimes it sort of seems like people have internalized the idea that they are illusionists, and thus they have to defend that word, convince others that the word itself does not associate with anything problematic.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

interactive and movies are passive. Even the "magician" analogy is flawed for every audience member but the one choosing the card or whatever. They're just watching, not actively making choices. Besides, when a guy gets shot in a movie, we all know it's not real. We all know the movie is a fiction. Movies like <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> might blur that reality/fiction distinction in interesting ways, but most don't.<br/><br/>Participationism is a great distinction against Illusionism, because perception is everything. I mean, are you really saying that it's okay to lie to people whenever you want because there's no meaningful distinction between honesty and dishonesty? And there IS a difference in action: the Participationist informs his friends that he's going to mislead them and make some of their choices moot in the name of fun. The Illusionist misleads his friends without telling them he's doing it.<br/><br/>Any analogy you make has to consider what choices you're giving the participants. Most art is not interactive in the same way an RPG is, with constant back-and-forth between the artists (one of whom--the GM--has special privileges).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427235/#Comment_427235" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T08:12:32+00:00" title="January 16, 2014  8:12AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Good point Bob.<br/><br/>So what does the GM gain by putting in such a meaningless choice?  In the original example if it doesnt matter if they search the crypts or the mansion and the group goes to the wrong location what's to stop the GM from being clear that there is nothing of interest in the mansion.  Let them search and find nothing, or if you've prepared it for some other reason down the road they can find clues about other things or ones pointing towards the crypt.   So a big downside is that the players cant find anything interesting in the other location, and sure you've given them the choice to what's most interesting to them a crypt or a mansion but who's to say the decision is unanimous or that they wont find something that ends up more interesting in the long run?<br/><br/>The reason a GM would do it seems to be to keep the pace up in play and to reduce the prep work a gm needs to do.  <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427237/#Comment_427237" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T08:18:28+00:00" title="January 16, 2014  8:18AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the thing about seemingly meaningless choices in an exploration game: you don't have to go forward to A or B; you can always turn around and go back and try to get more information.<br/><br/>You have to choose between the crypt or the mansion but you have no basis to make that decision.

And this gave rise to years of game texts literally telling GMs to lie to their players. And if we think of the many publishers locked in to the "supplement treadmill" business model, we can see that employing people to essentially write short stories and then call them "scenarios" is a great way to generate product.<br/><br/>I.e., if the only model we have available for "coherent story" is based on passive media (e.g., film, novels, TV), then it's inevitable that a technique will arise that forces the players into passivity.<br/><br/>This is why I'm really glad that Eero and Adam have pointed out that citing movies in this discussion is fruitless.

Maybe this is the case, and those with contrary experiences (myself included) are statistically aberrant, or they are misinterpreting their experiences. I guess even in this case it would be more exact to say that "illusionism is rare" rather than "illusionism does not exist", but I'll make allowances for rhetorics.<br/><br/>Textual history, which is always more objective and easier to study, seems to fall into an ambiguous middle ground on this. There are only relatively few texts that dare to be very explicit and clearly in the illusionist camp, but then again there are quite many texts that make the most sense when interpreted in an illusionist way, even if one could postulate that <i>of course</i> the players of this stuff know that it's all fake. The good ol' <i>Dragonlance</i>, for example, is a text that I have some difficulty understanding in a participationist way - it sure goes to some lengths to maintain the pretence (or maybe "ritual", when you play participationist) that it's a D&amp;D adventure and not a plot railroad.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427247/#Comment_427247" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T09:53:55+00:00" title="January 16, 2014  9:53AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I mean, as we're discussing a phenomenon of cultural history, it's fair to posit that true illusionism might be so rare as to be meaningless. </blockquote>\nNot if my personal experience is even remotely representative. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427248/#Comment_427248" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T09:54:32+00:00" title="January 16, 2014  9:54AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2014 9:56AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Totally disagree, Jason.

It's not even against the rules if the GM previously wrote that the ogres were on the west road, or if a module designer wrote that ogres appear on the west road, or if a corebook writer writes that ogres prefer to attack on the west road.  <br/><br/>Saying that ogres attack on the east road instead of the west is "lying" makes sense only if we privilege the designer, module writer, or yesterday's GM's notes over today's GM's in-play decisionmaking - it says the designer/publisher is right and the GM is deceptive or mistaken. Might it be that the designer/publisher is stupid or ugly and the GM is brave and really good looking and has figured out the right way to handle things despite the despicable game designer's most craven mistakes?   No, that whole path leads us nowhere.<br/><br/>Better to say that if the role of the GM involves the ability to set up encounters where and how they wish, the important thing is the criteria/principles by which they are set up. A GM whose job is "impartial referee of a world" is indeed breaking the rules when they make something interesting happen after a boring decision.  Their role in that situation is to firmly and decisively make sure that the players' boring actions lead to dullness and dreary tedium.<br/><br/>A GM whose job is "creative director of an exciting adventure" is probably breaking the rules more when they DON'T shift the ogre encounter to where the players are.<br/><br/>If you're playing a game with a GM who's manipulating things behind the scenes to give you their best attempt at an exciting adventure, it's probably their job to do so. Choosing to play such a game means you're up for the illusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427249/#Comment_427249" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T10:09:59+00:00" title="January 16, 2014 10:09AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2014 10:10AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, example time.<br/><br/>I'm playing a game of D&amp;D. There's an evil wizard, whom the party is trying to catch. We encounter him in dark alley and a huge fight breaks out. We've got him surrounded, he can't have all that many hit points, and we've got this deadly lightning wand thing with only two charges left. It's a highly valuable artifact; it deals incredible amounts of damage, likely to kill even major monsters in one hit.<br/><br/>However, the GM wants the bad guy to get away, because he needs him to be alive at the final, climactic scene he's got prepped. We attack and hurt the wizard horribly, inflicting dozens more hit points than he's likely to have (in D&amp;D, you can estimate hit point totals of wizards, after all, based on the spells they know and how many times they can cast them), but he's still standing. So, we pull out the lightning wand and discharge it upon the villain. He grits his teeth but fights through the pain! Damn, how is he still alive? So we hit him with it again. He falls down. So we cheer! We got him.<br/><br/>However, just as we're cheering, the GM announces that the wizard, while we were cheering, pulled out some kind of amulet (the GM is not terribly clear on the details, for some reason), gave an evil laugh, and teleported away.<br/><br/>--"What?!?" Say the players, in disbelief. "How did he survive that?"<br/>--"You don't know," says the GM. "Maybe he's got some kind of resistance to lightning that you didn't know about."<br/>--"Damn, next time we should use the anti-teleportation spell on the zone where we fight him."<br/>--"Yeah, maybe if you'd had that in place, you would have caught him! Better luck next time," says the GM.<br/><br/>After the game, the GM continues to play up the role of the clever villain who "tricked the heroes yet again", and strokes his beard thoughtfully when the players ask, "Wait, really? He had that amulet the whole time? How many hit points does this dude have, anyway?"<br/><br/>"Keep playing, and if you're clever enough, you just might find out, brave adventurers!" Replies the GM with a mysterious smile.<br/><br/>If you've never seen this in play, congratulations. I've seen it a lot, and remember being taught that this is the way "good GMing" should be done. People said so, of course. Articles said so. And adventure modules often had this sort of thing built into them.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427250/#Comment_427250" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T10:12:08+00:00" title="January 16, 2014 10:12AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>A GM whose job is "creative director of an exciting adventure" is probably breaking the rules more when they DON'T shift the ogre encounter to where the players are.<br/></blockquote>\nWhere this falls through, though, is when the players specifically chose that path because they were trying to avoid the ogre encounter.

For the most part I agree with JD, with all the power a GM has what's the difference between changing the situation as it happens or as in Paul's example what if he looked at all the abilities and magic items the party had and gave the wizard protection against all of them ahead of time with the teleport amulet as a back up.  Would it matter either way if it was written down ahead of time?  The illusionism isnt the problem it's the preplanning the outcome that was, it's just a symptom of the disease.   <br/><br/>Back to the topic at hand.

It's a sandbox. It's Tuesday night and Fred, Phil, Phyllis, and Fallon have shown up. Frank the GM has scattered encounters all over the place. If they go down the West Road and encounter the ogres, awesome. If they don't, who cares?<br/><br/>After all, Wednesday is game night also. That night Joe, Julie, Jill and Jack are going to show up and also be gamey gamers being gamey. So maybe they go down the west road and encounter the ogres. Or not. Who cares? After all there will be yet another  game night on Thursday and another group of gamers.<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>That's the early situation. And all of those play groups realize there are other players and also are <b>competitive</b>. It might not be shank the other PC in the back competitive,  but it's still competitive. And the GM really is just creating the challenges, seeding them, and acting as a neutral ref.<br/><br/>That's great. No really, fun times.<br/><br/>BUT! That's not what roleplaying stayed limited to. Groups were small, it became more about characters, and story, and imitating other storytelling media with interaction.<br/><br/>So people drifted play and techniques like Magician's Choice emerged. And part of that is because people were demanding those games change but were still using old game-y based techniques. Magician's Choice is like grafting a jet engine onto a Sopwith Camel, right? You'll go faster, but there's gonna be problems.<br/><br/>Now eventually, some smart monkey did start to think," Hey why do we do this dumb out-dated stuff that's irrelevant? I want them to have fun fighting some ogres and no one else is playing that might encounter those ogres, so why don't I just skip all the crap and go right to the ogres?"<br/><br/>And lo, it was Good.<br/><br/>But other monkeys just kept pounding that scare peg into the round hole, because square pegs and round holes were what they knew. And goddamnit, somehow that peg is gonna end up in that damn hole!<br/><br/>A lot of RPG techniques are like that. Low level OSR/TSR D&amp;D still gets played by people whose characters don't care about gold. They still start at level 1 with one hit die of hit points, even though they don't really want a character to die randomly at all. People are like that. They'll use all kinds of dated techniques that were built for a pretty different situation because it's what they know, and they just build patches along the way that seem right and kinda-sorta make a game do what they want it to do, and avoid what they don't like in a game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427262/#Comment_427262" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T12:45:10+00:00" title="January 16, 2014 12:45PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the GM asks if the party takes the left road or the right road, knowing that there are ogres in either direction. Doesn't really matter which way the party chooses. Fine.<br/><br/>Now someone in the groups says, "Hey, we're not sure which way is best. Let's go back to town and get some intel and figure out which will lead us safely to our destination." They spend a lot of time doing that. Maybe you're tempted to say, "Naw, don't do that, it doesn't matter. It's ogres all the way down," but you're maintaining the illusion so you stay mum. Lots of player time goes into learning which way they should go, and they ultimately choose the left road, and you don't throw ogres at them. <br/><br/>Maybe that was fun, so no real problem here. Maybe it wasn't fun though, or not as fun as actually fighting ogres or getting to the dungeon they were trying to reach, ogre-free. Maybe there were actual consequences that you could have avoided if you'd just plopped them in front of some ogres instead of asking them to choose right or left.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427263/#Comment_427263" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T12:53:42+00:00" title="January 16, 2014 12:53PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with discussing illusionism is GMs. This all becomes much more revealing when we consider illusionism and its techniques and variants in GM-less games, or even in game-less conversation - taking a cue from Apocalypse World that RPGs are a kind of conversation. The extension of illusionism / participationism is when one or more people have complete control of a conversation, unbeknownst to the other participants, and the rest have no control having their contributions mitigated and then dispersed by those in control. <br/><br/>What this helps to break out is that the way to avoid the evils of illusionism is to achieve a balance of contributions - about empowering all the players whether or not they are the GM. It also expressly means avoiding illusionism does not require a GM who dances as a puppet to the sole entertainment of the other players, that's just another kind of illusionism (or perhaps participationism). <br/><br/>Remember, you have to look at the conversational level, not a single incident. Balance happens as different participants express creative input and give and take happens. Methods can vary to handle a conversation - sometimes meta-techniques jar and break the conversations flow, sometimes influencing each other's behavior using cues and subtlety comes off as manipulative or dishonest. The specifics are unique to that group at that moment in their lives.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427264/#Comment_427264" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T12:56:07+00:00" title="January 16, 2014 12:56PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2014 12:58PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If a choice isn't really a choice, why present it as such?</blockquote>\nI agree!  The point I'm arguing (not 100% sure I'm correct, but I think it's an interesting possibility) is that this comes about through some combo of unconscious, habitual play on the part of both players and GM, rather than through the GM simply failing at some reasonable task they've been handed.  In other words, the GM need not commit the specific sin of saying, "Left or right?  Choose wisely!  Mwahahaha!" for the group to wind up sweating a meaningless choice.  The group may simply lack the awareness of what's going on, and lack the procedures to deal with it.  <br/><br/>For you it may be as simple as, "Let's just move on," but for a lot of groups that isn't the case.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think staying on the ball of aggressive scene framing and cutting is a rare technique in traditional gaming.  In some indie games, where a "scene" is an official game term, perhaps even one which resolution formally concludes, "What do we play through?" is a decision made consciously at regular intervals.  But in the fiction-based flow of "So what do you do next?", especially when paired with think-outside-the-box problem-solving, clear lines are absent, and choices come up as they come up.  When I GM a game that is neither complete improv nor complete railroad, but rather some interaction of prep, improv, and response to player action, I often <i>don't know</i> which choices will be meaningful vs meaningless <i>until they happen</i>.  Sometimes, the players will surprise me, and turn a seemingly-irrelevant fork in the road into something more.  Perhaps I'll even wind up investing a choice with meaning <i>after</i> the players come up with a way to get something out of it that I hadn't anticipated!  <br/><br/>In this style of play it is <i>vital</i> to be able to take a step back and ask, "Is this choice worth spending some time on?"  But, traditionally, there's no support provided for this, and many groups don't achieve it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427273/#Comment_427273" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T15:18:22+00:00" title="January 16, 2014  3:18PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>So are there any good uses of this technique?

Every card in the deck is a two of Clubs. Take your pick. It's just a set-up to a situation. Unless the package is a bomb and your whole party dies from a failed saving throw. That's a resolution. You could have stayed home and been told that over the phone.<br/><br/>Example 2: ogres to the West or ogres to the East? Doesn't matter. It's going to be ogres (the two of Clubs); might as well flip a coin. West it is. This is fine if the trick ends here. The party now has the very real choices of fight, negotiate, trick or flee. If they choose to flee, then the East branch <i>now</i> becomes a viable option; a meaningful choice! It wasn't before because it would have been ogres (two of Clubs) had it been chosen first. Now we know it <i>can't</i> be the two  of Clubs. It must be something different. If it IS the same ogre encounter again, then the GM has revealed the deck - all 52 two of Clubs! There's no trick. Note the fact that there <i>were</i> two choices (although seemingly meaningless at the time). If it were a straight corridor then the East branch would not exist and there-for could not <i>become</i> a viable option. That's the thing people seem to overlook with the whole East/West meaningless choice. The fact that you have an alternative path IS the choice. If the West path becomes untenable or just unsavory, there's an alternative to the East; not so with a straight corridor. That meaningless fork in the road becomes crucial when you have to backtrack.<br/><br/>  If the trick ended only with the possibility of a fight with the ogres (no other options), then this is Magician's Choice as a <i>resolution</i>. At this point, you can excuse yourself from the table and politely request an e-mail telling you how your adventure turned out. There's no need for you to actually be there. You saw the entire deck of Club deuces; there was no need for you to pick a particular one.<br/><br/>Example 3: PaulT's " an evil wizard, whom the party is trying to catch." Yeah, I think we've all met this guy before. And if you spot him as a recurring villain and call the GM on it; that should be fine. Just say: "Hey, we can't possibly beat this guy right now, can we? I mean, it would be kind of dickish to let us waste a Wish from our magic ring if it can't possibly work." And a  decent GM will say: "Yeah, that's right. Let's just role-play this through. Maybe you'll learn something about him; maybe he'll spot a weakness of yours. Let's see what happens" Cool. You spotted the set-up; you saw the card up his sleeve. Play it out; no harm, no foul; everybody keeps their dollar.<br/><br/>  If your character dies in this unwinnable encounter, then you should excuse yourself from the table and politely request an e-mail - well, you get the idea. Because the GM just showed his hand; he just showed you that his NPC (presumably named Mary-Sue) is more important to the game than your character. Good trick, huh?

Naturally if the group is happy with scene-framing themselves directly to the action, or hand-waving away the boring stuff, then everything is fine.<br/><br/>However I think there are also many players who *also* want to get the immersive aspect of experiencing a living breathing world, full of choices and side-routes and the like. They don't want to be playing in something akin to Final Fantasy, where every wrong choice route is somehow blocked by a fallen tree, or an unhelpful guard, or a small bush (that's Pokemon this time), and the only way to go is the single winding path marked Adventure. If a GM never describes forks in the path, or signposts to villages, or what have you they will feel cheated, even though they also have the expectation that something fabulous will happen whichever choice they choose.<br/><br/>The ideal GM response is skillful improvisation. If the players choose to turn off the road on their way to Castle Adventure and follow the trail through a wood to an isolated village then they are not going to be happy with nothing being there, nor with an out of character "Don't go that way, it's boring", instead there is a strong demand to make sure that choice also leads to something interesting or awesome. If you can produce that out of whole cloth, then great, but the Magician's Choice response is obvious when the GM also spent time in pre-planning. Don't make up something new, just move the thing you had planned for the obvious route to where they are now and everyone is happy.<br/><br/>This isn't really a meaningless choice situation either. The players probably know that the main road is the better route to be taking, but they want to poke the world anyway, that's what immersive play naturally leads too. The GM doesn't get to present you with no optional paths, and sometimes you just take them anyway. With limitless play time it would be fine for the GM to say "You knew that route went nowhere interesting, feel free to waste time on it", but the demand that you actually have some interesting things happen during a limited time slot kind of makes that a bad solution too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427308/#Comment_427308" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T06:52:14+00:00" title="January 17, 2014  6:52AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the Magician's Choice in RPGs, especially in short one shot games.

If it's a time / sanity saving method by which a GM can enable exploration style play and not burn themselves out on improvising then most (but not all) one-shot groups don't demand it, because they already know that exploration opportunities are limited by the format (unless you are running some sort of 48hr one-shot I guess). Players in this situation are generally going to just take the call to adventure and not demand that the world offers lots of choices to be immersive. If they won't, and you are running the kind of game in which MC can be used ... then it probably won't save you!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427315/#Comment_427315" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T08:36:43+00:00" title="January 17, 2014  8:36AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, Magician's Choice in a one-shot isn't less of a "sin." It's annoying whenever it occurs. You've basically asked me for input, insinuating to me that my choice makes a difference, then abracadabra, did what you wanted to do anyway. It's a waste of my time. The more you make me think my choices matter, the more annoyed I get when I figure out they didn't.<br/><br/>At some level, role-playing gaming is about making choices that matter to you. In a group session with an apparently coherent Creative Agenda, everyone thinks  that they care about the same choices and their outcomes. If the GM is using Force to make those choices essentially meaningless, that's a CA violation. <br/><br/>It's like your chess opponent telling you they intentionally let you win. Your victory is now voided, the good feelings you had from playing the game are now all wishy-washy, and subsequent games with this opponent won't/can't be the same until you rebuild trust.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427317/#Comment_427317" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T09:01:52+00:00" title="January 17, 2014  9:01AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, exactly.<br/><br/>The "sin" is not that a certain action can take place in two different locations, depending on which one is chosen first.

It's a <i>Magician's Choice.<br/></i><br/>When is it good?<i> When the magician is good</i>, when the trick works and as a player either you believe you made an actual choice or find out you just had enough fun it doesn't matter anyway. And yes, all old school advice in this case should be read as "a magician never reveals his tricks"<br/><br/>When is it bad?<i> When the magician is terrible</i>, can't perform the trick quickly enough, and as a player, you see the secret door, the almost invisible thread. Then the illusion is broken and you find out the magician is a fraud, this is a scam, you're being cheated out of your time and trust. And so you have all the right to complaint, point your finger at it and demand your investment back. And also, you have all the right to complain at every single old school advice and rules that made this poor devil of a GM think he could fool us.<br/><br/>So, as a GM, if you want to play the Magician, these are the stakes. Do it good and everyone will praise you. Do it wrong and nobody will see you as a magician anymore.<br/><br/>Of course, now we know that as GMs, we don't have to play the magician anymore. We can still do it here and there, but not all the game has to stand on this technique. We can be honest and tell players "ok, I'm not a pro magician, so you may see trough some of my tricks. Don't pay attention to that, feel free to laugh at me when it happens and let me go trough it, we're here just to have fun" And so, you will have Participationism fun at your table and nobody will be called a fraud.<br/><br/>And there are many other solutions there. Yes, you can work in your act and/or find other people ready to believe, but you can also realize you're a poor magician and try being honest with your players, do your prep well and stick with it, switch to a game that demands less bluffing skills out of you, have players help you out more and even actively produce material for the game in a more collaborative way, etc, etc.<br/><br/>In the end, I'd call the Magician's Choice a good enough desperate GM's choice. It wil certainly take you out of continuity problems, help you recycle material and keep your prep safe. But it's risky, and doing more than once or twice in a single session increases the chances that players will see trough the illusion and brand you as a liar and a bad GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427321/#Comment_427321" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T10:00:24+00:00" title="January 17, 2014 10:00AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave B,<br/>  The only flaw I see in your logic is that in the majority of times, there is no game benefit from making a decision. If we go down the east path or the west path, no change in benefit. Similarly, if the GM decides there is an evil wizard on the path, is that a benefit or a penalty or just something that happens? I know it sounds like I am supporting your argument, but the argument changes if the players go east in order to avoid the wizard and he appears on that path anyways.<br/>  You statement, "It is not a meaningful decision unless there is a game mechanic around it" makes sense if the Magician's Choice is happening in order to prevent wasting the players' time (e.g., "the evil magician will be on whatever path they take so that we don't have a whole session of nothing happens"). But more commonly the motivation for Magician's Choice revolves around GM wanting to use their prep, rather than trying to expedite the game I think.<br/>  What do you think?<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427323/#Comment_427323" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T10:27:54+00:00" title="January 17, 2014 10:27AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I agree.

The concept of  compressing time to gloss over the uninteresting has been a basic part of narrative practically since humanity learned to speak ("...and so ten days did pass, and the heroine found herself at the gates of the castle"). I think wyrmwood above is getting at a possible source of the dysfunction in identifying the disconnect between mechanics and goals in so many RPGs.<br/><br/>But I think the simple fact is that <i>now we now better</i>. We know we don't have to follow the PCs moment-tomoment because we're not just exploring dungeons square by square any more.* Ergo, I think it's weird to "patch" these old techniques with flawed tools like MC/Illusionism. I mean do we all still play chess with the rules they used in 6th century India? No, the game has evolved since then.<br/><br/>The problem is that this bad advice is still so prevalent. For example, it's not super recent, but I was leafing trough a copy of <i>GURPS for Dummies</i> recently. The first half of the book is full of point-shaving, chargen-optimization advice; how to make a PC "more effective". But the second half \u2014 addressed to GMs \u2014 focused almost entirely on how to effectively deceive players and railroad them into following your predefined plot. Insane! Why should anyone exert effort to optimize their PC when nothing the PC does matters?<br/><br/>I dunno. I think we've seen GM-ful RPGs that have shown us how to be surprised while still being prepared. We've fixed this problem.<br/><br/><br/>* But when we are, we <i>absolutely</i> follow the PCs moment-to-moment, but that's what works best for that kind of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427329/#Comment_427329" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T11:01:54+00:00" title="January 17, 2014 11:01AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>At some level, role-playing gaming is about making choices that matter to you.</blockquote>\nYes.

Without choice, there is no feedback, and if there is no feedback, then it's passive media, and that is much better served by other forms of entertainment.

And that's fine, so long as everyone is having a good time.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427339/#Comment_427339" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T13:13:07+00:00" title="January 17, 2014  1:13PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must admit, I'm getting a little confused. I thought the analogy was a bit forced, too.<br/><br/>"In a typical example of the Magician's Choice, the magician will ask a spectator to make an apparently free choice among several items. No matter what choices the spectator makes, the magician verbally forces the item which he wanted the spectator to choose.<br/> The magician must quickly and carefully craft his patter to convey the impression that the actions he takes with the items truly reflect the intent of the spectator."<br/><br/>  This sounds like "baffle 'em with bullshit". But the examples given are more about moving encounters into the path of the characters and the unbeatable NPC. Oh, and not getting caught doing it. So, illusionism (or a technique there-of). But it was mentioned that talk of illusionism was derailing the thread. <br/><br/> I get the point that we're discussing taking away Player choice without their knowledge but is that the same as <i>limiting</i> Player choice? Because all games, by their very nature, limit Player choice in some regard. But the Players are generally aware of the limitations up front so...<br/><br/>   Limiting (or removing) the choices that <i>matter</i> to the Players without their knowledge?  Agency? And how do we identify the choices that matter?<br/><br/>"David_Berg Quote<br/>No sweat on the derail. It seems that folks want to talk about illusionism. I've kind of moved away from my original focus on Magician's Choice anyway, and am trying to discuss <span style="text-decoration: underline;">decision-identification in unstructured play</span>."<br/><br/>I'm enjoying the discussion but it's seems to me to be getting unfocused.

And there IS a difference in action: the Participationist informs his friends that he's going to mislead them and make some of their choices moot in the name of fun. The Illusionist misleads his friends without telling them he's doing it.</blockquote>\nAdam, you are mangling these concepts.  I do not believe it is at all credible to claim that the Illusionist GMs claims to be doing something else.  There are plenty of gaming texts that make it clear that the GM has some kind of authority that endows them to manipulate the imagined space.  What's more, this is NOT part of the Forgeite defintiuon, for good or ill.  To whit:<br/><br/><i>"Illusionism is sometimes read as malicious deception, but that negative reading is misplaced. I think that a shared agreement "to be deceived" is typically involved, i.e., what I described before as the players not wanting to look behind the black curtain, and everyone being happy that the curtain is there. When that happens, Illusionism is functional, primarily because no element of the Social Contract is being threatened or violated." </i><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=4217" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=4217</a><br/><br/>Read that again:  <b>no element of the Social Contract is being threatened or violated.</b>  This is in exactly the way that the audience of a magic shows goes into it knowing full well that they will "be deceived", and with the expectation of ENJOYING THAT FACT.<br/><br/>Participationism is NOT merely acknowledging thew fact that GM force is at work some time, some where.  It is rather:<br/><i>"Participation might be a good term for the other end of the second variable (overtness), in which the GM's oomph is on the table, or the Curtain is "up," and the players are good with it."</i><br/>Ibid.<br/><br/>So the illusionist GM makes sure that the McGuffin is at the crypt or the mansion, depending whch the players go to.  The Particvipationist GM just says, next you to the mansion where the McGuffin is.<br/><br/>Participationism is NOT the consensual form of Illusionism.  Illusionism is NOT characterised by a non-consensual or broken social contract.  All this association of abusive behaviour with the Illusionist GM is utter crap.  I am quite happy to wear a badge that says "I am an Illusionist GM", but I am not prepared to do everything with the black curtain up, because that sabotages verisimilitude and engagement with the imagined space for the players.  I am doing it this way not because I'm an arrogant bastard who is overriding what the players want, I am doing it because THIS IS WHAT THE PLAYERS WANT.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427354/#Comment_427354" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T16:07:12+00:00" title="January 17, 2014  4:07PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2014 4:09PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa Gareth!

Whenever a character just happens to be just where they need to be to see or do something, it is like the GM saying to the player "Where do you go next?" And that being just the right place. <br/><br/>I'm guessing that the thought that our every little decision will be epic is a pretty modern idea. Thus the over use of the word epic.<br/><br/>I've run some great games using the Hogworts Express (a magician's choice railroad) and had great fun. I've also run lots of games that outline major plot points but let heroes do whatever they want. Success or failure comes from hooking the players. That is the real point.

Do you want to finish reading the book?"<br/><br/>In particular, the McGuffin. Earlier, someone disavowed the conflation of books/movies with role-playing. I disagree; at least where plot hooks are concerned.<br/><br/>The point was made recently in the Big Bang Theory that Indie was completely irrelevant to the plot of Raiders. The main character had no effect on the outcome of the movie. The Ark was never really being offered - it was never even on the table. We didn't know that, Indie didn't know it and yet it was a damn fine adventure. I would, have and will watch it again.<br/><br/>The Last Crusade has Indie looking for his father. But when he retrieves Jones Senior, he's sucked into the Grail Quest. Of course, the Cup of Christ was never really attainable, physically; it was never on the table to be possessed. But in giving up the Grail, they attain their own Spiritual salvation in the connection of father and son. And that, of course is the real Grail Quest - but everyone is after the object. Imagine an adventure where the Players have broken, flawed characters and they are on an quest to retrieve the Grail. Or so the GM says. Secretly, he is really offering the Players the opportunity of Salvation to their characters. But they think they are after the Cup. That's the false McGuffin that's never on the table.<br/><br/>And the ultimate McGuffin: The Maltese Falcon. Sam Spade has a plethora of choices in what to do with the statue, who to give it to and what to bargain for. EXCEPT - they are all pointless. He never had the Falcon. It was never in the story. All the adventure, action, intrigue, mystery - for naught. Nothing any of the characters did affected that inevitability. Damn fine story and adventure hook, though.<br/><br/>Briefly, in actual RPGs, I would point out a couple of OSR examples because the Magician's Choice seems the antithesis of a play style that considers dead ends and empty rooms a feature, not a bug. The outcome of Expedition to the Barrier Peaks sees the party unceremoniously ejected out a cargo bay door, none the wiser for their exploration of the "mysterious keep" that they were hired to learn about.<br/><br/>The "choice" in the Tomb of Horrors is whether to retreat or push on to destroy Acererak (a very simple, to-the-point challenge-based choice). We learn from Return to the Tomb of Horrors that Acererak's death was never really on the table; he was never there. <br/><br/>Here's a tired, old observation: sometimes the value of an adventure lies in the journey, not the destination. Sometimes you have to herd the kittens onto the Orient Express because that's where their little sand-box is - and they desperately need to take a shit.<br/><br/>On a personal note, I've noticed some lines being drawn in the sand. That's cool. We should have opinions. I'm sure someone is itching to tear apart some of the things I've posted here. But the value of discussion isn't solely in challenging someone else's assertions; it's also in challenging our own.

Like many, I started in the scripted rpg space and now move between gm-less and gm'd styles. In a game, I push strongly for the journey complications for character development, as they seem to make players happier.  They also feel like their characters matter, which they do.<br/>Like you said, what happens at the destination versus intentions is in doubt. The tools listed in this thread are ones I've used at one time or another, with no real preference. But I did initiate a trust relationship at the beginning of each game. I promised that I'd choose whatever made a more emotionally satisfying story, even if it ended in disaster. If you trust me to do that, then let's go.<br/>I did sometimes employ MC (or whatever the term is :-)), usually to start complications earlier, but we ended us literally self generating complications.  Sure, it can get gonzo if taken too far, but the players this far in the game wouldn't, it's as if they integrated the world limits into their thinking. It seems like more work to gauge each player's interest level and adjust, but it gets better with practice. <br/>I've appreciate the spirited discussion, as it's clarified what the different gm tools do for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427385/#Comment_427385" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-18T11:25:06+00:00" title="January 18, 2014 11:25AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But both of those people are wrong about what DMs in D&amp;D do.<br/><br/>Like, that's just not what the game is.</blockquote>\n"D&amp;D" is a large enough concept that it can encompass both of those PsOV.

When it's not, and players are assuming that choice is primarily about agency, then you have potential for badness.<br/><br/>I can see the former in the MHR <i>Civil War</i> campaign that I ran last year. There's a lot of that campaign book that is basically on rails, and it's openly acknowledged that the group will take that into consideration. It's assumed that players will switch characters, look at the debate over registration from various angles, and role-play their way through the major events... but for the most part, things will go down very much the way they did in the published comics. The players' job is roleplaying and color.

They probably should stop being your friends over this.</blockquote>\nNo, it's not, and you're being an ass. It's only lying if you're cheating in comparison to the rules those friends think you're playing with. This is not a difficult concept to grasp. As far as I'm concerned it's perfectly fine if you think that it's OK to lie to your friends about a game you're playing; in the real world everything surely depends on the details, what kinds of lies they are and so on, so I can see how somebody could be comfortable doing that. I think it's not fair to mock it if others don't feel the same, though. We might be naive for thinking different than you about GM prerogatives, but mocking that naivete is just cruel.<br/><br/>As for Crunch's ogre example, I find it impossible to say whether I would object to that in actual play, because it's not specific to a game or creative agenda. If that was his prep for an old school sandbox D&amp;D game, it'd be pure bullshit merely for using an encounter tree structure instead of letting the players take their chances to avoid or provoke encounters by their own choices. (I mean, serious breach of trust - if we had something like that in our D&amp;D campaign and that stuff had some consequence like beloved characters dying, where is the legitimacy that protects everybody from bitter recrimination?) On the other hand, if that's the prep for a traditional (or middle school, perhaps a more clear term in relation to old school) adventure game, I would not be surprised - I would likely be bored witless, and wouldn't understand the point of prepping different content for the different roads, but it probably wouldn't be much of a betrayal, if that's what the players signed on for. And then again, if that prep was for a lightweight old school game that doesn't quite do hexcrawl procedure or similar, but still does have consequential choices, then that seems entirely workable as a prep: you provide the players with full or partial advance knowledge of the encounters that will be encountered on those two paths, and let them choose which one they want. Having ogres on both paths doesn't seem to be an issue of any sort here, as there is still enough difference between the paths to make it a worthwhile topic of discussion to choose which path to take; if you'll imagine that same discussion after the GM told you that both paths have the exact identical series of encounters to be expected, <i>that</i>'s when you're faced with the total absurdity of the illusionist choice: it only makes sense as long as you don't know that it's not really a choice.<br/><br/>Probably the easiest way to make any crossroads at all in your adventure game prep into lies and deception is to execute it in play like it's supposed to be some big deal when it really isn't: describe that crossroads to the players, maybe give them some vague hints about the paths (but not actual information, just something for them to latch on without limiting your own options), stroke your beard knowingly when they speculate about which way to go. Build up expectations like that, and you're all but promising that this choice actually has consequence - a promise you'll break, as it is a lie. If the game you're playing is at all like the majority of rpgs, the players have <i>nothing</i> but the GM's interaction to tell them which parts of the gameplay are supposed to be consequential and which parts aren't. I do not personally like the cruelty of lying to the players about something like that, letting them engage with an illusionary choice when I've in fact ensured that it'll be the same whatever they choose. I don't like it as GM, I don't like it as player, to reduce interactions from real engagement into wrestling with the GM's smoke and mirrors. I could enjoy that sort of game if I knew about how it's going to be in advance (really, doesn't take much more than just letting me know that in this game the GM's going to manipulate feelings with illusions to hopefully achieve deeper experience), but if I was told that e.g. we'd be playing competitively, I would feel angry at being manipulated when and if I later found out that it was all a shell game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427460/#Comment_427460" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-19T22:40:58+00:00" title="January 19, 2014 10:40PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Wonderful. \n<blockquote>you're faced with the total absurdity of the illusionist choice: it only makes sense as long as you don't know that it's not really a choice.<br/></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427475/#Comment_427475" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-20T10:38:19+00:00" title="January 20, 2014 10:38AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, this thread escaped my notice over the weekend for a little bit.<br/><br/>Hey folks!  I would put this thread in slow down, but I actually feel like it's reached a good end point , in that I think<br/>a) some new threads are being started<br/>b) everybody is sufficiently full of vinegar<br/>c) there's little room to go from here.<br/><br/>So it's getting closed. Some other notes:<br/><br/>1) I'm going to watch related threads carefully. We may be close to exhausting reasonable discussion on this network of topics, and we definitely may be exhausting each other's patience.<br/><br/>2) If your response is to angrily tell the other side they're wrong or they're screwing up their game or how rpg theory works or whatever, you're probably mistaken about how people change their beliefs on the internet.<br/><br/>3) In addition to that, <a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a>, regardless of whether people are misinterpreting rpg theory or not, this gives no excuse for being a jerk to people.  You are not the only person being aggressive in this thread, but you are bringing a heated charge to this, and you are responding to other people's posts with a large amount of belligerence. Calm down, take a break. I note you've been warned before along these lines, so consider this a formal notice.<br/><br/>As always, feel free to PM me with your thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19132/magicians-choice-when-is-it-good-when-is-it-bad/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19132/magicians-choice-when-is-it-good-when-is-it-bad">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19132/magicians-choice-when-is-it-good-when-is-it-bad/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19132/magicians-choice-when-is-it-good-when-is-it-bad/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed">This discussion has been closed.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
