The players all go "this was good" after the sessions when I ask them, but it was the first time that one player told the other about an earlier session how awesome that was.<br/><br/>You have to know that we are playing one-shot quests because I really don't know wich players will turn up that weekend, so they are all agents of an organization and get a mission wich they have to solve in one session. If it's not long enough, they fail or die or something like that happens.<br/><br/>This particular session was untraditional in many aspects. First, I didn't have any missions for the PCs. I knew the players wouldn't ask what their mission is, because they would be concerned with escape and survival. The session started with the PCs as prisoners all tied up. And naked.<br/><br/>I decided beforehand how to GM all this. The players sat, but I stood. I walked up and down while describing the first scene. When one of the players started to ask rules questions and make fun, I was rude to him even "out-of-character" or "out-of-description" or what to stop him. (After the session I apologized and told him it was needed.)<br/><br/>It was planned that in the first scene the PCs couldn't do anything wich is somehow against the spirit of roleplaying, wich consists mostly of decisions of the players, but this was somehow right: the players wanted to act, but couldn't. They had to wait for their turn. <br/><br/>I knew that one of the players would be female and I tried to plan some kind of torture that was humiliating and wich I could show on her - of course without touching. I thought it would have more impact than on showing it on a male player. This was one of the most daring GM tricks I ever did. I was really afraid. In the end the torture became forcing them to drink some kind of poison.<br/><br/>After that everything was kinda traditional in regards of GM tools, I just had one trick in the story itself, but didn't really work.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
