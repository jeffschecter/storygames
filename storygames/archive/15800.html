The characters are, near-universally wealthy, bored, under-supervised teenagers, and their dramatic entanglements are wha the show is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unique selling point of the show is a sort of web 2.0 angle - the character's movements are all tracked (in the show) on a site called Gossip Girl, which uses anonymous tips sent in by other teenagers, usually via mobile phone. Every character on the show is aware of and read Gossip Girl, and as such the characters exist in a kind of self-inflicted psuedo-Orwellian panopticon where nothing can stay secret for long and everyone gets to know everything more or less as soon as it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe show is fascinating and I can actually recommend it wholeheartedly (or at least the first two seasons) if teen drama is at all your thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis RPG aims to simply capture everything that's great about the show in a relatively stripped down way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wrote this today in one inspired six-hour rush and haven't playtested it even slightly. I'm not aiming this to ever be for paid-for publication (I'd need a licence first, although I guess filing off the setting's serial numbers would be easy enough) It's obviously rough, unpolished and needs more thought into layout and organisation of the material, and quite probably a good deal more stuff on how to frame scenes. But nevertheless there are a few areas I am looking for specific feedback on:<br/>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n[li]Keeping in mind the genre of the show, can you think of more appropriate motivations to add to the list?[/li]<br/>\n[li] Keeping in mind the genre of the show and the incentives I'm looking to provide, what extra "if" statements might be well added to the resolution checklist?[/li]<br/>\n[li]How does the resolution system look in general? Does it make sense? Does it seem like it would work to you?[/li]</ul>\n<br/>\nFeedback on the overall tone and the writing would also be welcome. Am I too cynical about the show and its characters? It is written from a place of being a fan of the show, although not uncritically so. If you've never seen the show, do I give you a good idea of what kind of characters you're expected to create? What other advice would help? If you have seen the show, are there elements you love about it that I haven't seemed to capture, or that need more focus, or would benefit from advice directed toward them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for your time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358796/#Comment_358796" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T18:01:54+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  6:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Thomas, this game is amazing and exceptionally well-written.
