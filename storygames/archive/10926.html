WTF.<br/><br/>So, imagine an iteration of D&amp;D 4th with a bit of premise and thematic coherency built in.<br/>Imagine a set of classes, powers and adventures that together told a story.<br/><br/>Imagine that story was about a librarian, a foreign ambassador and a senator joining a group of knights as they venture into the wasteland to track down demons.

We'll see.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cedric P</cite>If one is not careful, could players possibliy say, "this setting is broken, we cant build this specific party build"?</blockquote>\nSure, they could. And it'll take good design work in order to present a set of classes that lead people to make choices based on what interests them, rather than what's broken.<br/><br/>However, I don't think that all of the classes presented in the PHB 1 &amp; 2 are balanced though. Further, I think that there are optimal party builds (If the party has a Scourge-build Warlock vs. an Isolating-build Avenger, that implies how the rest of the party should be set up, f'rex).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cedric P</cite>This make me think, maybe some symbolic stuff &amp; decorations from the Polaris heraldic illustrations wont really work as realistic 3d object if drawn in a more "realistic" style ;-)</blockquote>\nCan you explain what you mean by this?

Like how first nations, maya and Aztec artwork add a lot of symbolics details in their artwork, but those dont alway exactly represent practical real objects or clothing that people where using or wearing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242464/#Comment_242464" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T15:38:04+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  3:38PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, I get what you mean.<br/><br/>Kaleigh isn't planning to "transcribe" all of the pieces of Artzybasheff's original art.
