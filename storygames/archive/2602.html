New here, name's Simon. Swede by nationality, gamer by choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if this has been done, but I haven't seen it around. Possibly it could be a market to expand into and to bring RPGs to people who have never thought of playing them before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm talking about using RPGs as language instruction. Think about it: it's the perfect way of training yourself to using a second language! The GM should be a native speaker, preferably, and the players beginners. The campaign could start off in their home country. I imagine the characters being secret agents who are getting a new mission to another country. They'll have some basic training in the language before they ship out (the characters' language knowledge should be the same as that of the players), and then they travel to their target country. In the beginning, most of the people they encounter speak English, but they have to deal with street and place names in the new language, finding little notes to descipher, etc. As play progresses, they'd delve deeper into the mystery they're investigating, which takes them to the countryside, where English is much more scarce. After a good while, they have to make themselves understood completely in the foreign language. Possibly, in the final few sessions the GM will even describe in the target language.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the players would have to make some study outside of "class", as well, but I think that the game would both give them good practice both in listening, reading and speaking (and maybe some writing, too), and motivate their study. Especially if you have a conflict system based on the language, so that the more the player knows, the more powerful his character becomes. Example:<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: Suddenly, a couple of thugs jump out into the alley before you. It's a fight. Give me a statement.<br/>\nPlayer: "Je tire."<br/>\nGM: Well, you don't get any negative modifiers for grammar, but it wasn't a very complex statement, so you hit on a 5+.<br/>\nPlayer: (rolls a 4) Damnit.<br/>\nPlayer2: Alright. "Moi, j'essai de m'attaquer \xc3\xa0 lui et le donner un coup de poing."<br/>\nGM: Grammar not entirely correct, but it's a good sentence. 4+ to punch him in the face.<br/>\nPlayer2: (rolls a 6) Ha! I cry out: "Prend \xc3\xa7a, espece de connard !"<br/>\nGM: Excellent! Here, have a bonus token, to use whenever you see fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm, better make sure the players are more evenly matched than in the above example, to prevent too much jealousy. But I can imagine players sitting at home, studying frantically, to make their character "level up".<br/>\n<br/>\nPossibly, the easiest place to get these sorts of games together would be through internet gaming (since the GM should be at least fluent, preferably a native speaker), of which I have no experience whatsoever.

I think it might work better as a supplement to regular coursework, considering the time commitment learning a foreign language usually entails. (I think Andy was exaggerating a bit in the other thread, but Japanese <i>does</i> take a bit longer, as does Mandarin).<br/><br/>As an aside: I have a Vietnamese friend (Boat People no less), and he initially learned English with a whole lot of help from pop culture and PBS. That's part of why a total of five languages are spoken by various friends of mine (English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Japanese).

Like a real game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Neko, I agree, it'd probably have to be a supplement. Or does it? That depends on how long time you're prepared to wait to learn the language. A traditional language instruction would be terrible if it took you two years to get anywhere, but if you're in a gaming group and just having fun once a week, the learning becomes sort of a side effect. So it's two years compared to never, rather than two years compared to one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce" title="MtFierce"><img alt="MtFierce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/5582955/1136400"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce">MtFierce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59965/#Comment_59965" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T13:45:23+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  1:45PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the forgotten days of yore...I mean my youth, I remember that a lot of my language lessons (Japanese and Spanish) were better learned when I applied them to my gaming.

Interacting with a native speaker is better for what linguists call "negotiation of meaning," which in turn is better for acquisition (gaining an intuitive understanding of the language, as opposed to "learning"). At least for face-to-face roleplaying, evaluating for errors and using those for game mechanics sounds a bit cumbersome for me (play-by-post would be another matter though). It might be better to focus on actual communicative performance (competence: what you can do, performance: what you manage when you're on the spot), though that might make it harder to integrate language elements into the game mechanics.<br/><br/>I think the two relate somewhat, but not all linguists agree on that point. I'm not all that big a fan of some areas of linguistics (like phonology, which is like doing math with words), but I found language acquisition really neat. If my M.A. in Japanese was aimed at teaching rather than translating I would totally have to try to do my thesis about possible pedagogical applications of roleplaying in language instruction...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Also, something to think about: How to keep the game rolling without too-too long of a discussion on some grammar element that comes up.</blockquote>\nConsidering that happens even in classrooms on occasion, I have no idea. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61590/#Comment_61590" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T22:54:08+00:00" title="March 19, 2007 10:54PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey! Exciting! That's something I've been thinking about for teaching English in Japan.  I'm of the "communication is more important than perfect English" school of thought, so I had this idea about a game a bit like Donjon, where success lets you say what happens next.  For beginners you'd use a good faith interpretation of what they're trying to say, but for more expert users, you can deliberately misinterpret, requiring them to be increasingly accurate in their statements.<br/>\n<br/>\nI teach mostly junior high, so I was going to use it for really basic language.  Luckily, they're all really familiar with the tropes of RPG from playing Final Fantasy, so that's not a big deal for them.  Something like a maze, with various encounters, and they get to say what they do in response.  But then you can have like a "magic scroll" or something, that lets them say a sentance and have it be true in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394916/#Comment_394916" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-26T09:36:37+00:00" title="October 26, 2012  9:36AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was recently thinking about this thread in relation to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1858774754/magicians-a-language-learning-rpg" rel="nofollow">Magicians</a>, and how Kyle actually had the time, energy and sand to actually pull it off...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394958/#Comment_394958" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-26T13:50:27+00:00" title="October 26, 2012  1:50PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks for the thread Simon.
