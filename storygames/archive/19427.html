There you are, making up characters who have big dreams and great plans that they're sure are going to work, using rules from a book with FIASCO written on it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432427/#Comment_432427" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-12T01:27:20+00:00" title="May 12, 2014  1:27AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2014 1:27AM by TotallyGuy.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games with player written goals in which the GM challenges those goals can create a certain irony.  Hitting the most dreaded outcome by taking all the steps you can manage to avoid it sounds like it should be frustrating but sometimes it's the greatest feeling.<br/><br/>I have a couple of stories about my favourite ironic events from games I've played.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In a recent game (designed by our GM) I had a character who had the goal: "I will cure the Jovian Phage.  Then I will weaponise it to make up for our starship's weapon deficiency."<br/><br/>The GM introduced the circumstances (hostile alien hiding on the starship, hijacking controls) to which I had the character introduce this goal into the mix.  Following that the GM applied pressure.  The character broke and became unplayably insane when he realised that to kill the alien on our ship he'd infected the crew with a version he couldn't cure.<br/><br/>The character's amibition became the very thing he wanted to avoid most.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another moment of fantastic dramatic Irony was in a Burning Wheel convention game.  It was a dungeon crawl, the story was that every few years a party would go in and check the seal on an ancient evil.  My Elf had the belief "The Dwarf's greed will doom us all" to which I had acted on to try to get the dwarf away from us.  At the end of the session everyone was dead except for me but I would be trapped inside the dungeon until the next time a group came to check the seal, I could survive it too.<br/><br/>When I pointed out that I would probably be ok in the end the GM narrated the impact that the discovery of the dwarf's mask had on the rest of the world.  It was the one thing I witnessed him plunder, the one thing that made it to the dungeon entrance.  It turned out it was a very important artefact, just like the dwarf said, and it started a war when the dwarven prince and rival religious order (who'd sent us in the first place) found it.  When the time came for the next seal inspection the world was a very different place and nobody came.<br/><br/>The dwarf's greed had indeed doomed us all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432439/#Comment_432439" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-12T05:46:20+00:00" title="May 12, 2014  5:46AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, it depended a lot on the GM and the players. Right at character creation, you'd see if people would also laugh about their characters or take them veery serious.<br/>Of course, I guess games like Fiasco or also i.e. Maid RPG will put you in situations that make irony inevitable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432443/#Comment_432443" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-12T06:03:39+00:00" title="May 12, 2014  6:03AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2014 6:03AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World does this really well.  In an environment where scarcity is the defining factor, everybody depends on somebody else for something.  And of course there are always two sides to every story.  So when your PCs go off intent on killing someone who they've been told is a Bad Person, it's very easy to look at that person from another perspective and see how vital they actually are to the survival of yet another (innocent) person, or even the whole community.<br/><br/>So you killed Gizmo, the big mean guy who blackened the eye of your chatty new friend Sketchers?  Great, now he's dead.  But it turns out Gizmo was the only one who knew how to fix the generators.  And Sketchers?  He's a junkie.  Gizmo was tired of his begging and tried to slap some sense into him.  It didn't work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
