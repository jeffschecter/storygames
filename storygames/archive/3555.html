Through a degree of parallel evolution, we have been using a number of techniques (collaborative world building, dramatic editing, player scene generation etc.) in our traditional rpgs for years, but the jump to actually playing SG's seems to always falter. Except for Spirit of the Century.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat tends to be the issue is that whenever we discuss a game, someone will tend to fixate on a certain point in the game and therefore almost enact a veto on the game. Some examples:<br/>\n<br/>\nBurning Wheel: Crunchier than chewing diamonds - and that combat system just looks like a complete disconnect!<br/>\nBurning Empires: See above, and is it even a roleplaying game? Sounds like it should be a board game?<br/>\nDogs in the Vineyard: Religion? I hate religion. And we all play the same type of character? Why would I want to enforce morality?<br/>\nPrimetime Adventures: We are not ready! If we play it, we might spoil it...<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, to be fair, we are playing PTA but not by-the-book. It's very much in the traditional mold of the GM-as-primary author. The game is still excellent (it's managed to get me over my hatred of 1920s games) but it isn't 'proper' PTA and was never propped as being that by the GM. As I mentioned above, we are also playing Spirit of the Century and FATE is increasingly becoming the go-to-game for us when we have an idea for a campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, with my first GenCon trip imminent, I fully intend to bathe in as many game-on-demand sessions as I can get, and bring back a swathe of new games. Any hints as to how I can sell these games to my players better? The final irony.... my profession? Yup, I'm a card carrying professional marketeer! Oh the shame...<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80078/#Comment_80078" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-08T09:46:16+00:00" title="July  8, 2007  9:46AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can think of two options right away:<br><br>1. Try working in a smaller group.  Peel off the one or two folks in your group who you think are absolutely the most likely to really get into a story game, and do a one-shot or short-arc game just with them sometime during the week.  If you sell them on it (which ought to be easier, since a pre-emptive veto is less likely), then their enthusiasm will help sell those games to the whole group later on.<br><br>2. Be happy with what you've got.  Seriously, man, if you've got collaborative world building, dramatic editing, player scene generation, and all the other trappings of story games seeing regular use in your traditional games, why be so worried about playing a "true" story game?  You're obviously already cherry-picking the best ideas out of any story games that come down the pike and incorporating them into your traditional games, and your players are embracing them; how is that not a victory?  Might as well keep doin' your own thing until it stops working for you.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80079/#Comment_80079" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-08T09:46:59+00:00" title="July  8, 2007  9:46AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know.

Selling my group on indie games has been a rough process, but after several successes, my players have gained some trust when I field a new game.<br><br>We started with Truth &amp; Justice, which I think I fielded as the "supers RPG where it doesn't take hours to make a somewhat-unimpressive super, but 15 minutes to make a cool one."  After that almost fell on my face (because I was new to it and to playing around with loose narrative control), I ended up running in a second time for an impromptu group with an out-of-town friend.  That succeeded.<br><br>Then, also thanks to someone else in my group interested in it, we tried Dogs in the Vineyard.  A good chunk of my group loves chivalry &amp; playing uncompromising paladins, so it was an easy sell with "dude, Mormon paladin gunfighters."  That led to trying it again and again, to where it's almost our standard pick-up game.<br><br>Let's see...I ran Spirit of the Century for them, and that sold well.  We've done Don't Rest Your Head, the Shab-al-hiri Roach (with this one, try telling them it's just an evening's experiment), and our current Burning Empires campaign (which, incidentally, is one where as a group we aren't really enjoying most the system, but we're still playing it out because the method of storytelling is fascinating to us.)  With BE, I sold my players on a demo by showing them the scenes their characters didn't see, and they really enjoyed knowing (from a player-not-character standpoint) that they were marching into their doom.<br><br/>I suppose I should also state that I started by offering these other games as "off"-sessions, sessions that we planned ass one-shots that weren't during our normal RPG night and didn't necessarily involve everyone.  Ask two or three people to come over to play a game, and since you're not having to teach everyone the rules, you can focus in on the play.  Then let them tell the rest of the group what they thought, in their own voice &amp; words.<br/><br/>I've been trying to sell Polaris for months, especially after I got to play it in March.  I'm almost successful, but for finding the time.<br/><br/>After the last year, I would say to not evangelize.  Since you're trying to accomplish something, try offering the games in exchange for a personal favor -- that's how I got some playtesting for other people done in the last year or so.  I think Don't Rest Your Head might be a good one to try, because it doesn't require a lot of investment on your part as a GM if they end up not liking the game, the set-up is quick and the play can easily fit in a single session.  Oh, and don't abandon the idea of playing a "traditional" game afterwards -- I've run some Unknown Armies and another guy ran some SLA since we're starting playing indie games.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80110/#Comment_80110" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-08T15:13:00+00:00" title="July  8, 2007  3:13PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2007 3:16PM by Neil Gow.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the replies. Appreciate the ... forthrightness &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSmaller group? Actually this has worked to an extent. Our larger group (five players plus a GM) has spawned a smaller group (the PTA group) with three of us and another person who is acting as GM. Our aim with that group is to do short arc games, rotating the GM and with a distinct eye on trying new stuff. That said, the comments above were generated when I suggested I run BW with that group.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoved the comment about playing games 'as written' - it's painfully ironic as one of our group regularly lambasts me for throwing away huge chunks of rules that I simply find too much hassle to engage.... usually combat rules. We'll get around to using the scene rules eventually I reckon, but not for that GM or this campaign. No loss though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the best advice was the 'be happy with what you've got' comment. Yeah, you are wholeheartedly right. Appreciate what you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no, we could hardly abandon trad. games - we're about 20% of the way into the Great Pendragon Campaign and that little suckers only a few years from pulling the sword out of the bloody stone. It's become a matter of principle now!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be me and two others coming to GenCon Jason, and I think we intend to be hammering as many games and demos as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you guys recognise that this isn't converting evangelism - it's actually just wanting to try some of the cool games that everyone else seems to be having so much fun with already. Stripping the ideas out of them is one thing, but trying the actual things is another.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway. Onwards! Thanks again<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil<br/>\n<br/>\nps.

Then I started the Sacred Cow Burger and Sausage Company and started doing altogether new stuff. And as much as I love Luke and have tremendous respect for what he's done, I can't get into Burning Wheel for precisely the same reason so many other folks <em>do</em> get into it. Actually, it's the same reason I'm not really into Sorcerer, which is a very sneaky way of communicating fiction building tools to Champions players. In both of these games, the meat is the meat I want, but it's got all this stuff around it that I don't want. It's like ordering lamb in a restaurant (I love lamb) and discovering that the lamb I ordered is crusted with black pepper (I love black pepper): they're all good things, but the things I love are all in the wrong places for me and in the wrong proportions.</p>\n<p>I haven't played FATE (despite having owned a copy I printed out and bound 5 years ago or something) or SotC, so maybe you're right.
