And it feels like the game wouldn't be so good without a certain amount of PCs in play.<br/>\nI'm planning on playing LB next friday, and I only have 3 players right now (nobody here seems interested in anything else than D&amp;D;, CoC, etc.). Do you think 3 is enough ? I suppose the Lady and Cyrus Vance have to be in play. What would be the best third character ?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, and if 3 isn't enough, I'll suggest another game, such as Psy*Run...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368381/#Comment_368381" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T17:51:13+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  5:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say that you should add Naomi, since she is specifically focused on the Lady in a big way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368382/#Comment_368382" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T17:56:22+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  5:56PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Three is enough. The Lady and Cyrus are normally in play, you can add Kale and have a sort of love triangle (esp if Kale is a girl). Naomi as the cock-blocker of the romance is amusing, too.<br><br>You can actually have a good time with both Natasha and Cyrus as NPCs, and have the PCs be Kale, Naomi and Snargle. Then you run the game similar to Rosencrantz and Gildernstern Are Dead, they're the protagonists, but not exactly the stars. It's quite amusing that way.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368391/#Comment_368391" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T19:03:38+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  7:03PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played it with 3. I gave the players a few options for how to take it, and they decided they liked the feel of playing the crew and having the passengers be the NPCs, so we had Snargle, Kale, and Cyrus. There was some discovery of puzzling out who the Lady was and such, I would definitely run it like that again. Essentially, I guess I'm saying that the Lady and Cyrus don't need to both be in play.<br><br>However, with the Lady and Cyrus already established, I'd personally add Kale. Naomi would work as well, but I'm not so sure that Snargle is tied into them enough for him to function as a third.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368410/#Comment_368410" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T22:53:35+00:00" title="March 18, 2012 10:53PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run the game for three players, with the Lady and Snargle as NPCs.

Use the unused characters as foils for the player characters, vectors through which to add trouble to the plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
