Let's just say that due to economic limitations, priorities in my life and the limited spending power of the average Malaysian consumer, I don't have a lot of money to blow. At any one time, whenever things are good, I have twenty (US) dollars to spend; hence, the title of this discussion.</p>\n<p>This is, seriously, a hard limit; as much as it breaks my heart to do it, I can't get Burning Wheel because the damn game costs 25 USD, and this is all before shipping and handling.</p>\n<p>And yes, I can get <em>The Shadow of Yesterday</em> for 14.99 as a PDF, but... I've managed to score a copy of the TSoY rules, and I want to run it with a bunch of people I know before I commit to buying the whole shebag. Sorry, Clinton.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I've already spent my last two twenties to get a copy of David Gilbert's <a href="http://www.wadjeteyegames.com/blackwell.htm" rel="nofollow" title="link to Wadjet Eye Games page on game">The Blackwell Legacy</a> and <a href="http://www.wadjeteyegames.com/unbound.htm" rel="nofollow" title="link to Wadjet Eye Games page on game">Blackwell Unbound</a>.</p>\n<p>At any rate, apart from the restrictions I've talked about so far, here are more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I need to be able to 'sell' this to my friends. While I find the concepts of <em>Shock</em> and <em>Shab al-Hiri Roach</em> fun, I don't know if I can leverage my rather lousy persuasive skills on the people I know. The premises need to be relatively simple and straightforward, and definitely on the "beer-and-pretzels" range of games.</li>\n<li>I'm not only stingy, I'm lazy. I'm talking about maybe a couple of hours available every week for prep time, here.</li>\n<li>While I'd love campaign-based play, I don't expect it to happen. So, at most, the game needs to be played and mostly concluded (or at least can be stopped) in one session. Spending one session just making characters? Not gonna happen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So. Yeah.
