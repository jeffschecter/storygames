                    I haven't seen anyone do this one yet (here), and it seems like it might be, um, relevant at the moment, so here goes:<br/><br/>Why do so many games, from DND to <i>Exalted</i>, use defined character classes of one sort or another?<br/><br/>How does the inclusion of these sort of defined classes shape the games that use them? <br/>Does that inclusion make these games, and the play experiences they output, more alike, *fundamentally*? <br/><br/>What do you think classes do well? What do they do poorly?<br/><br/>Do you think we play a class, or something like a class, even in games that make no mention of it? That is to say, are we really playing a class when our game focuses on a specific role, like a Dog in <i>Dogs</i> or a Sorcerer in <i>Sorcerer</i>, or even when we assemble a collection of character traits ourselves?<br/><br/>Even though i started RPGing with AD&amp;D, I've always misliked the idea of classes - but now i'm forced to wonder why that is, exactly.<br/><br/>(EDIT: <i>I hope this is the right format for one of these threads! Ah, looks like i've bolloxed up the category, already...</i>)                </div>

<p>One suggestion I have seen advanced is that it provides pre-packaged diversity.</p>
<p>This is interesting to me because it effectively works in reverse - if you have two level 2 wizards in a D&amp;D group, they are going to be strongly similar; the players choose two different classes instead, to mechanically individuate their characters. The effect fades with the degree of customizeability increasing; at D&amp;D's sweet spot, classes make a transition between a classification of characters and a building-block with which to construct optimised models or gimmick characters. (I've seen a character with 7 classes at 14th level.)</p>
<p>I see that you're not actually using this definition, but something looser; however, to me a "class" is a package of mechanical and descriptive features that one chooses for his character, chosen from a set of specific options. That's minimal and not fully restrictive, as it permits things that I do not consider classes, such as priority arrangements in Shadowrun.</p>
<p>Based on this, you can say a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes constrain the mechanical features of characters</li>
<li>As a result, they provide optimisation minigames.</li>
<li>It is dangerously tempting to over-proliferate classes, which negates both of the above features.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think that we implicitly play classes in games that don't actually have them.</p>

                            In my mind, there are two things that D&amp;D type classes do really well.<br/>
<br/>
The first is hit points that grow. If you could buy D&amp;D scaling hit points in GURPS, it just wouldn't work out well I think.<br/>
<br/>
The second is magic that grows in power. D&amp;D forces you to get good at a whole lot of spells, rather than a GURPS style system where you can choose to be really good in one or two spells.<br/>
<br/>
And both of those fit a theme. They prevent over specialization of characters. A D&amp;D character can't help but get more hit points, fight better, and save better.<br/>
<br/>
In 3e, with the building block classes, this part is still true. Which is why I think it actually works, even when people play with a wildly multi-classed character - though the multi-classing does make it easier for someone to make a dud character.<br/>
<br/>
So pre-3e, they also prevented over broadening (though there were those odd elven tripple classed characters, but I don't think anyone ever seriously played them, and the double classed characters seemed to do ok).<br/>

                            Something like character classes are pretty much required for any game as heavily focused on breaking up abilities into tiny pieces as DnD is.<br/>

<br/>
Curiously enough, I find the greatest effect of classes to be not on the characters but on the groups.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have classes, you immediately have well-defined group roles, which means there will be a natural tendency for groups to distribute those roles among the players.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, sure, four-player D&amp;D groups that <i>don't</i> have one fighter, one cleric, one thief and one wizard, they exist. Think back, though. How many of those have you encountered, as opposed to how many groups <i>with</i> that distribution?<br/>
<br/>
In ShadowRun, for instance, which is a game where that same role distribution is just as useful, it doesn't appear as much, IMHO, precisely because of the lack of well-established classes.<br/>
<br/>
And Shreyas, yes, over-proliferation of classes negates <i>this</i> feature as well.<br/>
<br/>
Corollary: if you're gonna have classes, have classes, but <i>keep it down</i>. If you keep having that nagging feeling that you need <i>just one more class</i>, best do away with them entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                            Heya,<br>
<br>
Classes can serve many purposes:<br>
<br>
-Niche Protection: every character/player has a specific job only he can do<br>
-Role Definition: it gives the players and idea of what kind of character they will protray<br>
-Flagging: it gives the GM an idea of what kind of campaign the players want<br>
-Color: it adds detail (choices) and heightens interest in what goes on in the game<br>
-Consistancy: the players know what to expect from the game each time they play<br>
<br>

                            Depending on the game, classes (or other categorical choices) can simplify character creation (and even, possibly, make it go quicker).  D&amp;D 3e doesn't do this so much, what with all the skill points and feats and whatnot, but look at previous versions.  Picking a class was one of the few things you really got to do when defining a character.  Roll attributes, race + class, gear, done!<br>
<br>
White wolf also managed to use them to provide an immediate 'us' vs 'them' type mentality when tied into the setting.  Vampire Clans, Werewolf Tribes, etc.<br>
<br/>
I'd also like to point out, to whoever said it above, that technically, D&amp;D classes don't directly provide either of the two features you mentioned - growing hit points and growing magical power (or power in general) is really more a function of D&amp;D's level system than its class system.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            "What can you expect to be able to do?" is what I ask out of a character class or an occupation or what not.  I expect thieves to be able to skulk, deckers to be able to type, doctors to heal, and super space sword ninjas to be able to pull out weapons and walk stealthily while dressed in a vacuum-proof suit.  Depending on the task to be resolved, a class seems to indicate who has the highest likelihood of accomplishing it.  As for the other question, yes, I've seen a lot of folks boil down their characters into "classes" even outside system.  (I myself am a cleric/bureaucrat.  Erm.)                        </div>

                            I don't think this point has been made yet, so...classes are great as factions.<br/>
<br/>
If you want in-fighting between players as part of your game - it's a staple in LARPs - then classes are great. Basically, when someone picks a class, you're telling them: your friends are <i>this</i> group and you hate <i>these</i> guys.<br/>

                            Splats, and to some degree, classes, also strike me as giving a cultural similarity value to an otherwise fantastic setup that lets people more quickly and easily grasp group dynamics and identification. <br><br>John Kim has talked a little about the way that early RPGs with their "your job is what you are" mentality fit a certain cultural niche (Midwestern mid-70s), while the next wave of skill based RPGs make "what you can do what you are" in another cultural niche (early 80's social mobility college students). <br><br>I'd suggest that a lot of White Wolf splats fill a similar function for suburban teens and undergrads, by making the supernatural society function around cliques, which any North American highschool student from the 90s onwards would have to be familiar with, it gives an easy sense of identification and understanding of the functionings of the world. These guys don't eat lunch with those guys, but they'll share pot, etc. <br/><br/>Of course, I'd also venture that a lot of our problems with, movement away from, and distrust of such systems has a lot to do with how we relate to the cultural paradigms behind them. I know far more 30 somethings that don't want a clique or their job to define them than I do teenagers with the same problem. (Though the current crop of highschool students has a different relation to cliques than my group did 15 years ago. Which makes me look at the restructering of splats in the NWoD through jaundiced eyes.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>

  OK, I see classes as doing the following:<br/>
Game balance - If you want to ensure the players are equal in power, character classes help<br/>
Setting Establishment - The world can be defined by the archetypical characters that populate it<br/>

                            I don't think that's a true distinction, Mr. Bishop-Ropy.<br/>
<br/>
Classes are classes, and splats are just a subtype of 'classes'.<br/>
Levels are orthogonal to classes, and can exist separately from them, or together with them.<br/>
<br/>
Talking about them together seems to dilute the discussions about them.                        </div>

Granted, there are not very many level-without-class games.  But I do think the two concepts are orthogonal.  Hence why D&amp;D is often referred to as a 'class and level' system.                        </div>

                            I stand corrected!<br/><br/>Since I've therefore played lots of class-based games in WoD, I can actually participate in this discussion.<br/><br/>Classes give the player a foundation upon which to characterize -- it is both a suggestion on "what my guy generally does" and is also a <em>challenge</em> to the player to complicate and to some extent break out of that stereotype in a believable and interesting fashion.  Players say, "I'm not just a Bard/Pooka/Agnite, I'm a Bard/Pooka/Agnite that does this-and-such."<br/><br/>It's been mentioned, but when the classes are representative of real and self-acknowledged groupings of people in the setting, this provides an immediate connection between player and setting.  A savvy GM can then involve the faction in the situation, thereby binding the PC into the situation.  Consider it a very very rough relationship map.                        </div>

<i>I'd also like to point out, to whoever said it above, that technically, D&amp;D classes don't directly provide either of the two features you mentioned - growing hit points and growing magical power (or power in general) is really more a function of D&amp;D's level system than its class system.</i><br/><br/>Sorta true. Classes make a distinction between characters of what they get for those levels though (big distinction for powers, moderate distinction for hit points).<br/><br/>Hmm, are there any class systems without levels?

Your class gives you a slate of traits.  The only source of new traits is classes.  Differnent classes have different traits.<br/>

Experience allows you to raise those traits individually.                        </div>

                            There are quire a few Class games without levels.  The entire White Wolf continuity, pretty much.<br/>
<br/>
For a different tactic, look at UnderWorld, by Gareth-Michael Skarka.  Also classed with no levels - and rules-light enough that it's super-simple to make a character.  Pick 'class', pick 'race', pick a few simple traits (like, 3) and you're done.                        </div>

                            Most of the Japanese RPGs that I love (many of them by the same company) use a variety of Class/Level together ALL THE TIME. However, since these games have as their priority goal "Be able to generate characters and play FAST", it's easy to see why they go that route.<br/><br/>Star Legend: Space Opera RPG: <a href="http://www.fear.co.jp/starlegend/index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fear.co.jp/starlegend/index.htm</a><br/>Basically, your character is made up of two out of about a dozen archetypes (you can stack the same one twice), like Space Princess, Lawman, Explorer, Tech Head, etc. Those determine all your "charms" (to borrow from Exalted) and I believe many of your starting attributes as well. You never gain more classes, just levels.<br/><br/>Beast Bind: New Testament: <a href="http://www.fear.co.jp/bbnt/index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fear.co.jp/bbnt/index.htm</a><br/>A horror-ish game kinda like Vampire Princess Miyu. You choose, again, two classes/archetypes of character from another list of 12-15 or so, including vampire type, changeling, elemental, robot(ic/ish), etc.  Those determine all of your "charms" and starting abilities. You never gain more classes, just levels.<br/><br/>DoubleCross: A superhero action/suspense game: <a href="http://www.fear.co.jp/dbx2nd/index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fear.co.jp/dbx2nd/index.htm</a><br/>(one of my favorites)<br/>Basically, there are about 10-14 classes that correspond to the superpowers available (fire, electricity, pheremone, gravity, bodymorph, monster-form, light/laser control, summoning, superspeed, etc). You choose two of them, or load the same one twice to make that oen more powerful (but most folks choose two diferent ones). These determine all of your abilities. Your attributes are determined by your powers, plus your "two jobs" (real and cover: Most folks appear to be school students but are actually government agents, etc). You never gain levels or other classes, but you can buy mroe abilities.  That is, level and class are set at the beginning and aren't used from that point on.<br/><br/>Arianhrod: A simple/cute fantasy game: <a href="http://www.fear.co.jp/ari/index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fear.co.jp/ari/index.htm</a><br/>You chooose two different classes, and that pretty much determines everything. You're ready for play. I'm not sure if you gain more classes, but you definitely level.<br/><br/>Alshard: Japan's answer to Exlated (^.^)  <a href="http://www.fear.co.jp/alshard/index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fear.co.jp/alshard/index.htm</a><br/>(basically a simple, fun, high-concept game that emulates the feel of console games like Final Fantasy. Lots of well thought out gamist elements)<br/>You get "3 levels" to start off with, and have some 14-18 classes to sink them into (1-1-1, 1-2, etc). Those determine EVERYTHING: Starting attributes, starting gear, starting "charms", other special abilities, combat and defense, simply EVERYTHING. Literally, all there really is to Alshard chargen is to choose which three (or two, etc) classes you want, then write down all associated abilities. near-instant character generation. <br/><br/>And since the classes are really varied, you can come up with very groovy concepts just by combining the classes in unique ways.  You want a brooding Elric-like character? Sounds like Elementer-Samurai-Black Mage to me. Want to emulate Yuna from Final Fantasy X? Sorcerer-White Mage-White Mage. From FFX-2, it'd be more like White Mage-Vagrant-Agent (tech/gun user).<br/><br/>All in all, this company primarily relies on classes for quick, easy play, role differentiation, and because they implement several classes plus combinations, you can pretty much make up near-anything that comes to mind.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Part II</a>. I summarized these in my LiveJournal post, <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com/150828.html" rel="nofollow">Raph on Levels</a>, back in December.<br/><br/>One of the points that struck me the hardest was that levels create a tiered reward and <i>rotation</i> structure for content (a "content multiplier," Raph calls it). You fight kobolds and goblins for a while, then they get boring, but right about that time you level up and now you're fighting orcs, who require different tactics than kobolds and goblins. You wouldn't dare set foot in Gold Mountain when you were "merely" 15th level, but at 30th level, it is a challenge within your power. It rotates new content into your reach on a predictable schedule, thus keeping you engaged.                        </div>

<blockquote>how long do they play out, both in terms of session and campaign?</blockquote>
Joshua, you mean the games themselves? Most of them are "Standard RPGs" which don't really address the issue, but indicate through play examples and Replays and the like that they run from one session to a campaign of several adventures.                        </div>

                            Thanks everyone!<br/><br/>That "quick start up time" feature is probably the biggest thing that classes have going for them - you just grab a class or two, roll some stats to give you a little individuality, grab a cool power or two, and you're good to go. <br/>I've played tons and tons of one-shot DND games over the years, doing just that!<br/><br/>However, the "role differentiation" bothers me still:<br/>Doesn't it always end up seeming that your're not playing "Aragorn, Heir to the Throne of Man", but instead just "The Ranger"?<br/><br/><b>Joshua:</b><br/><br/>I do see classes as a "challenge", a stereotype to overcome, when i encounter them,  even in video games. I've played the Diablo Amazon who fights with a Zweihander, or the DND Mage who only uses magic to enhance his stealth &amp; theif-y-ness. <br/>But i don't see why that would be a good thing. <br/>I've always taken my play in that "moldbreaker" mode to be a sign that <i>classes are not for me</i>, that i'd be better off without them constricting my ability to change my character away from hir stereotype.<br/><br/><b>Brand</b>:<br/><br/><code>John Kim has talked a little about the way that  RPGs mentality fit certain cultural niches.</code> <br/><br/>Now that is a *really* interesting observation! <br/>I'm unqualified to discuss it, but my intial reaction would be to say that it is mostly a case of "Art imitating Life", overall. <br/>If true, however, it really does go to the heart of the topic - we like games that fit our own percieved place in, and picture of, the world.  <br/><br/><br/>(And i do think levels are something entirely different, worthy of their own thread.)                        </div>

                            Brand's referring to an excerpt from an (yet unpublished) essay that I posted on my blog: <br/><br/><a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/14638.html" rel="nofollow"><b>About D&amp;D</b></a><br/><br/>I've also got a more mechanics-focused essay where I talk about class and template mechanics: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/systemdesign/classes.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Class and Template Mechanics</b></a><br/><br/>So my definition is that a "class" is a category for the character which has a continuing effect on how the character grows.  A "template" or "package" is a fixed grouping of abilities which doesn't have any effect after it is first used.  Templates are good for quickstart, but with experience the character will drift away from the original template.  <br/><br/>Classes are a required mechanic.  In order to spend experience points, you need to know not just stats, but also what your character's class is.  You never drift away from your class, but instead follow it's path.  So Vampire's clans are classes by this definition as well as D&amp;D.  <br/><br/>This makes very different feels.  Classes form a continuing source of identity.  You can grow and change, but it is within the framework of your class.  In contrast, templates are what you start out as, and the more you grow the less you look like the template.  I think both of these are meaningful as symbols of identity.                        </div>

                            John Harper -- Thanks!  I've been reflecting on how I can be difficult at times, but I still enjoy sharing ideas with you (and others) and find it rewarding.  <br/>
<br/>
On classes being a box to think outside of -- definitely!  I remember distinctly running an AD&amp;D convention game as a teenager where all 12 of the PCs (two groups of 6) were thieves -- though a handful were multiclassed.  I did a similar test recently, where in a Conan OGL event I had six PCs who were all Cimmerian barbarians.  I at least find this challenge fun, and the events ran well.                        </div>

(And they'd be right - the first group isn't really playing the game correctly...)<br/><br/>Has anyone made a class based game that gives you a class to pick, but then also gives you something like tSOY's Keys that you choose separately? <br/>That might be really interesting - you might be able to have two forces pulling in opposite directions: conformic abilities vs individual goals.                        </div>

                            That's Sweet20, not Key20. And my experience with it was a miserable failure. I think the problem is that it qualifies as sneaking up on mode. Perhaps is the entire group sat down and discussed what the implication of keys on how the game plays out would work.<br/>
<br/>
Designing a system with keys and character classes from the ground up might provide an interesting system. The classes might provide constraints that make it easier for players to deal with the otherwise wide-openness of things like keys (so far, my experience is showing that Dogs with it's narrow constraints is easier for players to adapt to than Burning Wheel which is totally wide open).<br/>

                            I may be doing exactly what you're saying Frank, pretty soon. My discussion with Levi on my Final Fantasy heartbreaker has led me to something close to that very same thing. I hate to 'announce' something, but this is my first design (I'll stick to it, hopefully) and I'm designing something almost exactly like that.                        </div>

                            I just saw FF7 Advent Children - awesome.<br/>
You don't get that kind of action with a class based system - except Feng Shui...<br/>
<br/>
Heh - I was all set to rail about how classes are the last refuge of lazy game designers who need their niches' protecting -<br/>
But then I read the thread and it actually occurred to me what people were saying:<br/>
<br/>
Classes are packages of crunch, often with attached fluff. <br/>
The packages vary in size and customisability. <br/>
Consequently classes necessarily impact upon how a game plays, but not always on the fluff (although they should be represented in accurate fluff).<br/>
<br/>
But if you're gonna have two classes don't make shugenja crap.                        </div>

Can you elabourate on "You don't get that kind of action with a class based system" ?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My take on the action in the movie was that it was quite a bit of an attempt to (smoothly, colourfully, dramatically) recreate the feel of the party &amp; turn-based system of the later FF games, complete with X's rotating characters...<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I should also toss out the notion that the classes in later FF games are rather unique, from a tabletop perspective, in that while each character has a class, each class is also the belonging of a specific character. <br/>
<br/>
Couldn't that be the basis for quite a nifty game, maybe even reaping benefits from both sides of the fence? (Although it probably *would* quite lend all new depths of meaning to the phrase "character creation"...)                        </div>

                            Well, in my experience, most class based systems are slow and clunky both in character creation and in play. I think I've had single FF battles that have lasted as long as the movie...<br/><br/>To recreate the kind of fast action sequences from Advent Children you need a rules lite classless cinematic system like <a href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/call_to_adventure.htm" rel="nofollow">Call To Adventure</a> or <a href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/swansong.htm" rel="nofollow">Swansong</a><br/><br/>But seriously - I already said you could do it with Feng Shui, which has very rigid classes so I've already contradicted myself <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> <br/>Classes are pretty subjective things, packages of crunch which cunningly look like they provide player choice when actually they RESTRICT choice massively. <br/><br/>How do FF classes belong to characters? <br/>Don't named characters just get their own specific crunch bonuses/restrictions?<br/>What fence?                        </div>

                            My experience with FF is that each character is their own personal class (a package of skills and abilities with built in advancement, via John Kim's article, above), which would be pretty cool if you took that into a tabletop game, no?<br/>
<br/>
So the Fence here is the divide between the advantages in balance, pickup, role assignment, group cohesion, and whatnot of a Class system, and the advantages in personalization, character, and interaction of a (supported) Template system.  (To say it one way, attempting to use John Kim's definitions.)<br/>
<br/>
Probably the closest thing to this is Capes - where you put togther two Archetypes and customize it a bit before throwing the character into the game.                        </div>
