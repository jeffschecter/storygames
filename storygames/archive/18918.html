See below. <br/><br/>For some time now I've come across a notion that there would be some issue with striving for success (in character that is) while playing a drama oriented game. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.  <br/><br/>Drama isn\u2019t about winning or losing, that\u2019s apparent, but it\u2019s definitely about people trying to get the upper hand, or at least cope with some crisis. Sometimes against overwhelming odds. And while trying they need to deal with their issues, their conflicted lives, their relationships and so on. But they\u2019re really trying. They want to succeed. They want to beat the devil.  But it\u2019s uncertain if they\u2019ll succeed. <br/>Play to fail is also a way to achieve drama, but using a different stance.<br/><br/>However, maybe no one is actually saying this at all. Maybe I misunderstood the intentions with those comments and threads, but in the case I didn\u2019t, would you agree that there are such notions out there? And if there is, do you agree with them? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers" title="VictorGijsbers"><img alt="VictorGijsbers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers">VictorGijsbers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423113/#Comment_423113" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T06:13:43+00:00" title="October 18, 2013  6:13AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2013 7:11AM by VictorGijsbers.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I doubt that anyone here thinks that striving for in-character success and creating drama in the story are incompatible. Many systems are built around the premise that the player will strive for in-character success, and then build a system around this that turns this striving into the source of drama. Would <i>Sorcerer</i> work if the characters didn't try to be successful? No, because if they just accept failure, they won't be tempted to summon demons, and there is no game. Similarly, the key to running <i>My Life with Master</i> is to make sure that not just the characters, but even the players themselves, want the master defeated and will do everything they can to make this happen. <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> constantly asks you what risks you are willing to take as you try to succeed; if your answer is "none, I don't need to succeed," it falls flat. If you play <i>3:16</i> and nobody is interested in getting more kills than the other characters, the system isn't going to work.

This is fun not because you get to write and stage a play, but rather because you get to experience the struggle (agonism) of the sympathetic main character (protagonist) from an internal viewpoint. It is also fun for the other players because they get to see how <i>you</i>, the specific person, deal with this combination of protagonist identity and conflict-rich situation.<br/><br/>It is notable that the above type of game still does not prefer for the players to adopt a na\xefvely triumphalist attitude towards their characters; the player still needs to enjoy it when their character suffers legitimate defeat, otherwise they cannot be convincing about depicting the struggle. There cannot be struggle without real respect for tragedy. So the player's task is to play-to-win, if you want to put it like that, but his enjoyment ultimately derives from credible and powerful portrayal of the protagonist in his struggle, not from merely winning.<br/><br/>As for whether somebody somewhere thinks that this kind of game does not exist, I'm sure that there is somebody like that somewhere. I also hear that there are people who think that the Earth is flat. It's such a dumb way to frame a question, to ask whether there might be somebody somewhere who thinks something stupid that you disagree with.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mans" title="mans"><img alt="mans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iRxOHEiGuPM/TuCnFScfciI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/PQTJfJAblzg/s45/rs.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mans">mans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423123/#Comment_423123" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T08:42:01+00:00" title="October 18, 2013  8:42AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I'm sorry.

The characters should absolutely try to succeed in their efforts, as that's what <i>their</i> goal is, but I don't think the player's goal should necessarily align with the characters' goal 100% of the time.

In Fiasco, you play towards failure or success, but you play it fully.  You are freed from the burden of choosing S/F when you pass it to someone else.

Either you do it [activate a negative trait] for the bonus, and then you're missing the point of WHY you're doing it.<br/>2. Or you do it because you think it's fun, but then you don't need the bonus, because you will do it anyway.<br/><br/>I would instead form the session around playing out the weaknesses. To create a situation that includes the weakness, play out scenes that leads up to that situation, and then finally play out the consequences of the situation where the weakness is involved.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter to me if the player's and the character's goals differ.<br/><br/>a) If they are the same, then the game should try to create bleed, so the player feels for the character. <i>Despair </i>would probably be the key feeling to strive for.<br/>b) If they differ, then the player can take a step back and treat the character like a puppet. It's possible that <i>schadenfreude </i>is the key feeling here, no matter if the character win or loose. If it wins, it's about the joy of other's misfortune and if the character looses, it's still about the joy of other's misfortune because the player and the character are separated.<br/><br/>It's two different ways of playing, and also two different ways of designing a game.

I would say it's a part of immersion (in character).<br/><br/>Most immersive (in character) games I played are kind of lazy when it comes to create bleed. They assume that the player itself will bring it to the table. There are multiple theories in to achieve bleed, but I'm not the right man to talk about it because it was years ago that I actually had that play style, and I did it mostly the lazy way (where players bring it to the table).<br/>\xd7 In <i>Beyond Role and Play</i> (free pdf), there's talk about a constant loop between character, player and setting, where one part has to adopt to a previous incitement in the loop.<br/>\xd7 Others around you can help out by throwing themselves into an emotional state. The closest example I can think of is Nicole Kidman's performance in The Others, where her played-out fear affected me as an audience and made me feel it too. This is caused by <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2012/11/the-walking-dead-mirror-neurons-and-empathy/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">mirror neuron</a>.<br/>\xd7 You can possible achieve bleed through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29#Conditions_for_flow" rel="nofollow">flow</a>. You have probably read Arvid's <a href="http://imbuildingsomething.blogspot.se/2010/09/flow-er-model-introduction.html" rel="nofollow">Flow-er Model</a>, although he probably means all kinds of immersion (in setting, in fiction, and so on).<br/>\xd7 You can probably do theater exercises to leave your mind open and closely connected to your emotions. I've been spending my summer reading books for theater teachers, and they are filled with this kind of stuff.<br/>\xd7 There is also the theory of spatial presence, but that one is as broad as the Flow-er Model, even if it uses somewhat the same strategy as the first point in this list.<br/><br/>Read the first link in the first link above. That will give you some suggestions of Jeepform scenarios that creates bleed. At least according to the authors.<br/><br/>[edit] By coincident, my rss feed just gave me a link to <a href="http://vimeo.com/10030923" rel="nofollow" target="_new">a video about bleed</a>, done by a jeeper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423168/#Comment_423168" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T19:49:04+00:00" title="October 18, 2013  7:49PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Speaking as someone who has posted in one of the threads I suspect you're asking about, I think it's absolutely appropriate for players to play characters who strive for success \u2013\xa0but I think that it can hurt certain kinds of games if <i>players</i> (not the characters) always put "winning" ahead of creating an interesting story as a group. The characters should absolutely try to succeed in their efforts, as that's what <i>their</i> goal is, but I don't think the player's goal should necessarily align with the characters' goal 100% of the time. Sometimes it's just more fun to accept that things will go wrong for your protagonist so that you can figure out how to get them out of problematic situations. </blockquote>\nA good example of this is <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>. If the PCs always go 100% all-out in every single conflict, the game will break down. Sometimes you have to refuse to, say, Invoke the Power of Three or draw your gun because it simply isn't what your character would do.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423175/#Comment_423175" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T23:22:50+00:00" title="October 18, 2013 11:22PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't actually think DitV breaks down if everyone goes 100% in every conflict unless there's something I've missed.  The whole town, children and puppy dogs and slightly-less-vicious player characters alike will be bleeding and burning and whatever maimed survivors remain will starve to death when the Dogs ride on, but that's not a failure state of DitV.  You really can be the most heartless, aggressive, vicious bastards you want in that game, march through the town shooting uncertain people between the eyes and burning those that oppose you alive and if you can pull it off (roll well, the GM rolls crap, etc.) you can do exactly that.  (Dogs actually works better if there's at least one player who plays in this mode even if not everyone does.)<br/><br/>I think what you're getting at is that there's not a conflict between "what my character would do" and "prevailing in this situation" if your character just wouldn't escalate to a particular place. Similarly in a mercenary D&amp;D game, you might not stab the blacksmith over 3 silver pieces worth of haggling that you want and he won't give, and that's not "prevailing" in the sense you don't get the 3 silver pieces you wanted, but neither is it "failure" in the sense of "I tried to do something and didn't do it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mans" title="mans"><img alt="mans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iRxOHEiGuPM/TuCnFScfciI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/PQTJfJAblzg/s45/rs.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mans">mans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423182/#Comment_423182" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-19T05:30:41+00:00" title="October 19, 2013  5:30AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>That kind of game mechanical bonus has IMO nothing to do with drama.<br/><br/>1.

I'm talking about it in my thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18841/bribes-and-judgement/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Bribes and judgement</a>, which is basically about feedback loops. Having a system that eats dice and then a reward that gives more dice is a kind of zero sum feedback loop (which I have nothing against). A positive feedback loop is seen in <b>D&amp;D</b>, where you get XP for hacking monsters so you can increase your values and hack even more monsters.<br/><br/>However, getting XP for roleplay - which isn't something connected to game mechanics at all - isn't a feedback loop. It's just disconnected. It's like if I sneeze, and you slap me. There's no connection at all. If you play out weaknesses, more situations should instead occur so you can play out even more weaknesses, which means that the game builds up more and more (positive feedback loop). But to think like this demands that you go beyond game mechanics, and instead think of how to build a story. In how the system (which the game master is part of) should react in the fiction.<br/><br/>This is what I like in games that builds agendas (for PCs and NPCs), because that's a way of formalizing reaction within the fiction. When one agenda is disturbed, a repercussion will occur. And each participant reacting to another within the fiction is nothing more than communicate in creating a story. I wonder what more ways there are to formalize communication like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
