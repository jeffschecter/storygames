P. Lovecraft. It plays in two styles: Purist and Pulp. Purist is pure Lovecraft: as the game goes on, you realise humanity's impotence in the face of unfathomable ancient monsters. Pulp is more about shooting eldritch things. We'll be playing Pulp today. Now, this is based on the Gumshoe system. The big thing about the Gumshoe system...</blockquote>\nAnd so on, for about ten minutes. Now, of course you need <i>some</i> introduction, but beyond a minute or so? It's just too much. Much of the information won't affect the game; and much could be explained during the game.<br/><br/>Often, they'll explain the conflict system in advance of actually using it.\n<blockquote>So, this is how Combat works. First, you roll to hit. Usually it's 3 or over on a d6; but if the Athletics rating of the person you're trying to hit is 8 or more, it's 4 or over. You can spend points from your Scuffling pool to add to this roll.</blockquote>\nI've listened to many long spiels like this recently. I never take them in. Especially, I never take in the explanation of the combat system. I've learnt to stare malevolently at the table until the GM stops speaking.<br/><br/>And although I said "ten minutes", above, what actually happens is this goes on for about an hour. There's an explanation of what the game's about. Then there's an explanation of all the different character types. Then something else. And so on. It's spiel after spiel.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should be more proactive, though. Perhaps I should say "I'm just going to get a cup of tea. Give me a call when you've finished talking". Or just bang my head on the table until it all stops.<br/><br/>Or is this me? Am I being unreasonable? Is there some deep underlying function to all this I'm missing?<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>* If I have played with you recently, I'm not specifically talking about the game we played. I'm actually thinking about a few different games I've played over the course of the last year.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122905/#Comment_122905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T03:22:23+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  3:22AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sort of agree.

Players didn't know where they were, or how things worked, even the people who knew the game were at sea. It underlined for me how badly games do need something to lead into them, otherwise they are like getting the ingredients for soup but not turning on the heat or stirring them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122906/#Comment_122906" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T04:17:47+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  4:17AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the most part, one would hope that the rules aren't too obscure that you can just talk about what you're wanting to do and just learn from there.  For GUMSHOE, I listened to the rolemonkey's Esoterrorist actual play podcast and noticed a couple of things.  There was no rules intro at all..  For combat that didn't matter too much.  It didn't matter too much at all for various skill checks.  They were able to simply describe what they wanted to do and the GM explained how.  Roll a die, beat a difficulty, spend points to get it higher if you think you need to.  One thing that I think should have been explained is the points re: investigation thing.  That would have taken like two sentences.  One of the points of GUMSHOE, from my understanding, is that you don't fail to get the clues.  An explanation of that and how the points work for that would have cut out a bit of the groping for information that needlessly went on in the rolemonkey's podcast.<br/><br/>In short, I agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122917/#Comment_122917" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T05:49:01+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  5:49AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a problematic phenomenon.<br/><br/>Partial solutions:<br/><br/>* We need to stop viewing "gatekeeper to the rules-text" as part and parcel of being "the GM". Ideally everyone should own the rules and know them before play begins, but in lieu of that ideal one could certainly make some effort to pass the book around in advance of the first session, explain the rules in text form somewhere in advance of the session, etcetera.<br/><br/>* One of the reasons an up-front explanation may be needed as opposed to "learn as you go" is to do with character creation. If you don't understand what the various widgets on your character sheet mean until you've already been playing for several hours, this leads to serious problems if your character is then not want you wanted him or her to be. This is mostly a problem in long-term games with strong character continuity, but can cause problems in short form games as well -if the entire game lasts four hours, it's not great to only figure out three hours in that your character was crippled form the start for what you wanted him or her to achieve.<br/><br/>* Related to the above point: the first time you play something, or in a context where you can't guarantee other players knowing the rules in advance, have pre-generated characters made. Then you can explain game procedures as they come up, with players having reassurance that the character they have is guaranteed to be effective in the scenario.<br/><br/>* Set your game up deliberately to have a "learn the rules" phase. The only game I can think of that has anything like this is Dogs in the Vineyard, where the initiation conflict (which also serves other purposes) is useful as a relatively low-stakes introduction to the conflict system. If you screw up that conflict due to not understanding the rules, it's not generally a big deal - your Dog's life can't be on the line, and you get a trait out of it either way. this works especially well if you do the initiation conflict starting with the most experienced player first - less experienced players can watch and get the hang real quick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122919/#Comment_122919" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T06:10:08+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  6:10AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's not so much usually "GM as gatekeeper to the rules" but "GM as owner of the game".

But if that's not possible, then there's a two-stage process that can work fairly well:<br/><br/>Step one:  On one night, we get together and talk about the game -- the premise, the system, character ideas, "What do we do in this game?", all that stuff.  Rules and gameplay are sometimes demonstrated like examples in a rulebook -- as isolated vignettes whose only purpose is to answer the question "how do I do combat?" or "how do I win a conflict?"  If we're feeling really ambitious, maybe it'll be like the tutorial level of a videogame -- a brief, highly simplified collection of scenes that serves to familiarize us with how the game works.<br/><br/>Step two: On another night (never, ever the same night), we get together and actually get the real game started.  Usually by this point someone's put together a cheat sheet of important rules so that everyone can have some reference material on hand during play, and those of us who like to read (like me) have had a chance to at least flip through the manual between step one and step two.  We may be shaky on a few details, but we've got the gist of it well enough that we can get some momentum going during play.<br/><br/><br/>The downside to this system is, of course, that it's nearly impossible to do a one-shot of a system that we haven't played before.  Which is fine: in the past, when we've tried doing a "cold" one-shot of a new game, that game has generally been much less fun than it could have been...and that's not only a waste of time we could've used to do something more fun, it's also not fair to the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123118/#Comment_123118" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T14:12:27+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  2:12PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this isn't just a problem of nerdy detail-obsessed GM's (though it is that), it's actually a problem for the hobby as a whole.

If a more obscure rule comes up during play, I'll explain it then.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this helps the players focus on learning how to find their way around the system because the learning the system is the task at hand for this "rules session" or what have you. This can be damn painful though. The first game I ran was D&amp;D 3.5 and I basically spent two hours bombarding the players with strong advice to make sure their bases were covered and a load of convoluted who-knows-what regarding combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to introducing players to background, I'll tell them at first what sort of setting we'll be in (i.e. steampunk, dark fantasy, space opera, whatever) and then get them to run character ideas by me, at which point I might set forth a few little things they might use to expand on their concept that they may not know are available. Once everyone has something workable, other elements such as world history and the like are introduced through gameplay (and I always make a big scene of really important stuff) or when a player asks about something. If it's something their character would know, I'll tell them. If it's not, I won't, but there is usually a way for them to go and find out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123400/#Comment_123400" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T11:24:43+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 11:24AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Background presentation and introduction is the subject of a thread I've often promised to do and have never done, because I am a fundamentally untrustworthy soul, but one thing that has helped me over the "big background dump, in order to get a couple of things to stick" problem was to get in my own mind a clear and <i>finite</i> list of what I, as GM and organizer of campaign background expected the players to know and absorb, and reducing that to writing, and explaining my expectations.<br/><br/>If I'm running a fantasy game and the name of the coin of the realm is a thaller, and I want the characters to refer to thallers, I need to put that on a piece of paper and tell them "learn that and use it".  How else are the players going to know what they are supposed to listen to?<br/><br/>Even relatively complicated historical backgrounds (Poland in the late 18th century, plus vampires) have been able to be reduced to a one-page typewritten set of background facts that I expect them to know, and then they can ask questions or I can explain elements as they're introduced or invented.<br/><br/>It's worked a LOT better so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123427/#Comment_123427" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T11:57:15+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 11:57AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, I am with you 100%. I <b>hate</b> the long preamble. It's been happening to me a lot more with boardgames, lately. Explaining the <i>entire</i> game before we start (or worse, reading the entire rulebook outloud) is so pointless. The first time playing is a learning game, for me. I expect to get a general overview and then learn each procedure as we come to it, and absorb the whole thing after a complete game. I don't feel the need to be awesome and beat everyone the first time out.<br/><br/>But I have noticed that some people really, really need that. They get all uncomfortable and squirrelly if they feel like they don't have mastery over every last permutation of the game before it starts. As if they're afraid of "getting screwed" by some unknown factor and looking stupid. So this need for the long preamble can be instigated by players, too. The GM gives a brief overview, then the players start in with a thousand ever more detailed questions, trying to learn everything before the game starts so they can do everything perfectly the first time.<br/><br/>My magic words to alleviate some of this fear:<br/>"So, now that you know about attacks of opportunity, you can totally move back and do that over."<br/>"You should have gotten the bonus for the last roll, too. So we'll say it was a success."<br/>"Actually, you only get one of those re-rolls. Do you want to go back to your original roll and keep it for now?"<br/><br/>Free and easy, no pressure, everything is re-doable while we're learning. That's my preferred mode, since it fosters some trust among players, and also lets people learn the mechanics (or setting or whatever) in context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123444/#Comment_123444" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T12:32:44+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 12:32PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, here's one I have used:<br/><br/>"No, no, you'd be penalized more than we thought.

They're feeling an insecurity and they're trying to cover it by acting out. I've played games with people who I would describe as <i>absolutely terrified</i> (of doing the wrong thing, usually) from start to finish, even though they said they had fun.<br/><br/>It leaves me scratching my head.

You've got all your friends sitting there, and you are responsible for their fun, you are responsible for their understanding, you are responsible for the system, you are responsible for them being able to work together. You probably have spent a long time thinking about the game, learning the rules, and have a lot of that bottled up inside and no clear idea about how to organize it for effect presentation because that's not a skill you've ever been schooled in. <br/><br/>So the nerves set in, and you start talking. The fear sets in, and you keep talking. <br/><br/>....<br/><br/>As for the folks who need a rule vs. folks who need all the rules thing, I have found that there are people I cannot play with unless they've read the rulebook. Which can suck, sometimes, as they might not have time or inclination to read it -- but if I have to teach them, I will go nuts and the other players (who need just one rule to get going) will go even more nuts. They have to know the rules, all of them, and in a fairly set order. So I have to make them read the damn book. <br/><br/>For the folks who are somewhere inbetween, I still stumble sometimes. I often give Mo, when teaching her a new game, too much or too little info. She'll sometimes get this glazed look in her eyes and then will say to me something right out of G's first post. Other times, thinking on that lesson, I'll give her the "get going" info and not think "oh yea, you do really need to know this one thing two or three steps ahead of time" and then when we get to the moment she suddenly realizes I've not told her something critical. <br/><br/>I'm still working on it. Right now my best friend for it is games like Days of Wonder (well, most of their games) that have quick play cards, introduction rules booklets, and then more detailed rules books. The different levels of information not only helps me learn the game, it helps me teach the game to people who have different levels of need for understanding. <br/><br/>----<br/><br/>On a player level, I think the reason for the fear you see has to do with whammy GMs, a history of bad play, and other things. I know a couple of guys who get really, really defensive if they do something "stupid" in a game because of past family dynamics in which being "stupid" in a game resulted in hours and hours of mockery, ridicule, and sometimes the sort of light physical abuse brothers love to heap upon each other. ("I can't believe you fucked us by attacking China! Never get in a land war in Asia, bitch! I don't care if this is the first time you've played Risk you whining baby, I'm gonna wedgie you until you can taste your own anus!") <br/><br/>Combine that with the fact that if you've got a step on up to social fulfillment, then stepping stupid can very easily be seen as a route to being socially shunned or mocked, and you've got a recipe for disaster. For fixing that, I've found no better solution than ideas like yours about do overs and such. If the first game isn't gonna be so hardcore (no matter what the later games might be like) and really is something of a do-over for learning, it helps vastly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123533/#Comment_123533" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T17:15:22+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  5:15PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2008 5:17PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, yes, and yes.

That sounds okay, maybe, until you realize that it meant she was constantly on show, constantly being judged, not playing but performing, and worrying about her performance. And of course, because the system was rigged and only the popular people got top marks it left her down on herself and feeling stupid for not doing "well enough"<br/><br/>Even now she still forgets sometimes and worries after a game if she did well enough. She says "Oh I didn't play that too good did I, I wasn't good enough, I wanted to do X Y and Z but I didn't" as if she is being constantly judged and scored. It makes me really angry (not with her) because some assholes basically took away the fun from her RP *and every future RP she is in as well!* (Most of the time she is fine and can just get on with playing and having fun, but it comes up in LARP situations a lot)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123629/#Comment_123629" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T05:09:33+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  5:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're drifting.

This is my first post here\u2026 I hope I won\u2019t do anything inappropriate but if I do please tell me. Thanks!)</span><br/><br/>Some sources for this problem, which overlap what others already wrote:<br/><br/><i>Issues of trust</i>: the GM fears potential future troubles if everything is not perfectly clear at the start. In some gaming groups it might be justified, or maybe the GM has had experience with such a group.<br/><br/><i>Expectations</i>: some players actually like or demand such data. The GM might be one of them, and carelessly assumes everybody shares his taste, or he knows (or believes) such players are in the group. Some games demand long and detailed explanations either setting-wise or system-wise.<br/><br/><i>Writer\u2019s block, stage fright</i>: maybe the GM somehow fears to begin the game and unconsciously postpones.<br/><br/><i>Unaware</i>: sometimes you just get stuck in \u201cboring mode\u201d and aren\u2019t enough aware of it to shake yourself out of it. I know it sometimes happen to me when I am tired or distracted.<br/><br/><i>Likes to explain</i>: some people just love to explain things.<br/><br/><i>Shows off</i>: isn\u2019t my setting/rule system cool?!<br/><br/><br/>If you\u2019re the culprit GM, sometimes just becoming conscious of the problem is the solution.<br/><br/>The first thing I do is to determine what is the <i>minimal </i>information needed before play. Everything that can be explained during the gameplay should be.<br/><br/>I find it helps to create a first scenario specially to introduce world and rules elements progressively. (In medieval settings, a tournament is a great setting for this kind of scenario.) You can use pre-generated characters to speed this up and start to play before character generation; therefore the players will be more knowledgeable for character generation. Or you can use it to test-drive the characters and adjust them afterwards.<br/><br/>If the game demands to explain much material, I prefer to have one or more explanations sessions, usually coupled with character generation. And/or I give the players advance documentation. Some players will prefer the explanation session, usually those with much free time, others will prefer written documents. Some don\u2019t like either and that probably means that the game is inadequate.<br/><br/>If I believe some players demand much information because of trust issues, I try to reassure them: we\u2019re all here to have fun, everybody will be treated fairly. If they suffer bad consequences from misinformation, we\u2019ll retcon or they will be compensated. I quickly switch from tell (reassure, explain) to show (play!).<br/><br/>If some players demand much information because it is their taste, they can read the fine manual, cant\u2019 they? Or, when possible, we can schedule a special session with them.<br/><br/><br/>If you\u2019re not the GM, first check if the others are bored too. If enough are bored, slip into your guerrilla facilitator outfit and try to re-focus the session.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thanks for bearing with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123678/#Comment_123678" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T08:15:21+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  8:15AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ajax!

That is, when you kick off a game you need get the table into shape/mood/space to play and a common mistake is to talk to them until it feels ready.  This usually stops not when the table is ready but when the GM is tired of talking.  I recently recognized I was doing this and decided to instead engage the table and get some conversation about the game flowing until it feels like we're ready to dive in.  This seems to take about four minutes.<br/><br/>I can't quantify what this table "state" is that I'm aiming at -- it's a kind of ice-breaking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123898/#Comment_123898" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T03:07:37+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  3:07AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty much exactly my spiel for demonstration games of GUMSHOE.

There are three things going on here:<br/><br/>1)  Often I am introducing the game to a group of people.  Not only am I partially selling the game (most of them are not going to buy it, much less read it, before playing the game) but I am their intro to the game before they figure out if it's something they want to invest the time and money into.  Thus I often feel like I have a lot of ground to cover.  <br/><br/>2)  I often have pregens and with those pregens come a certain bit of back story.  I can't seem to encapsulate things quick enough.  It's very frustrating because I feel like I created this situation and I don't want to be in the situation where the player says "Well, THAT would have been an important peice of information to know before I play."  I hope that since I am Black-boxing (I like that term) games less and less now-a-days I can start limiting the backstory.  After a Artesia convention game Jessica Hammer and Mendel gave me some great advise once, which was instead of telling the group about their various relationships I should have a relationship map.  I was really embarassed.  not because they were right but because I did that for SO many of my games why hadn't I done so fo THAT game.  I was annoyed with myself.<br/><br/>3)  I like the players to really try and engage the rules and I feel like if they don't know them first then how can they utilize them.  Especially since I tend to run pretty crunchy games.  For instance, with Dogs, often I have only a few hours and by the time I get through characters creation and initiation then there's no time for the town.  I think I am going to make it a habit to try and have an intro scene and give everyone a shot at running through the system before getting into the game proper.  Sorta like a character intro in a movie.  For my current Artesia game I think I can fold the rules intro and the backstory into a starting scene.<br/><br/>I hate that convention games I end up getting really into it a hour into the session.  I really need to focus on getting that down.  It might be down to 15 minutes but hey that's better, right?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

to reassure players that if their lack of knowledge of the rules means they make bad character creation choices, they can do them over mid-game. I also promise not to penalise them for not knowing the background, and let them do decisions over. A lot of this doesn't need to be too explicit - experience of previous actual play should be enough.<br/><br/>The introductory, low stakes scene is useful, too, a kind of pre-credit sequence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5482/the-gms-opening-speech" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5482/the-gms-opening-speech" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5482/the-gms-opening-speech/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5482%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5482%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
