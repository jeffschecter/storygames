I suspect it comes from your gaming group (based on my minimal reading of AP stuff from you) and your shared trust and implied (or pre-established) social contract.<br/><br/>For me, I take stating play mode (IWNAY v NOGH) and defining Lines and Veils very, very seriously. Perhaps it's because I play a lot at cons or with new friends (or strangers). Perhaps it's because my oldest gaming friends have zero exposure to hurtful play (argumentative, sure; but button-pushing... never). Perhaps it's because I have a serious Line or two that I'm as likely to punch someone in the face as leave, when they're crossed. Dunno. But L&amp;V talk (and establishing NOGH play, if that's what we're doing) is critical.<br/><br/>Just leaving it "to happen" strikes me as... well, I'll say it: irresponsible, if there's any likelihood of approaching mature themes. A casual "and the orcs rape and pillage the village" tossed out in D&amp;D can cause a VERY bad time, for a victim of serial abuse or kidnapping and rape over the course of days. Hell, look at all the kerfluffle over Grey (sic) Ranks, RE insensitivity to Poles and exploitation of tragedy. That whole game premise cross some folks' Lines--and a vocal minority has made it well known.<br/><br/>Anyhow, there's rarely a "right" and "wrong" in anything we discuss, here... but I'd side strongly with pre-discussing these things as a Best Practice with new or unfamiliar groups. Sure, it's not always critical; sure, we can shit during play and watch what emerges. But the risks are high, and I am ill-inclined to hurt people unwittingly--in a damned game--when it's so easily avoided by a ten or fifteen minute conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165369/#Comment_165369" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T12:36:36+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:36PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>"Someone's gonna get hurt"</blockquote>That's already a part of IWNAY, implicitly.

They feel stilted and weird, and take some of the pazazz out of it. "In this game, let's not have any killing of people under 5 feet tall. And no erect penises, except on statues". <br/><br/>In some LARPs there's a rule called <b>cut</b> and <b>brake</b>. If someone's doing something you're not sure you want to go any further, you can say "brake". If something happens that you really can't deal with in-game, you say "cut" - which <i>stops</i> the game right then and there, and calls for immediate debrief.<br/><br/>So, for example, if you're uncomfortable with same-sex flirting and another player of the same sex starts playing out a seduction scene with your character, you can say "brake", and the game goes on on a different track. If you're a rape victim and another player pushes your buttons hard without knowing it, you can say "cut" and do whatever you like: Talk about it, cry, walk away, slap people in the face... but the game doesn't continue until everyone's okay with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165427/#Comment_165427" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T14:42:07+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  2:42PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs,<br/>\n  I, personally, would prefer to get that stuff out of the way up front.

Sure, they're aware of some things that make them uncomfortable but until that something is given context their actual true Line remains unknown. When someone says "no child abuse" and so the group avoids child abuse all together you're not actually respecting a Line. You're excising a TRENCH of potential fiction where in the true Line lies.  Being socially attuned to them over the course of play is one thing. Trying to codify them upfront so no one gets hurt, ever, is another.<br/><br/>Now, admittedly I'm an IWNAY player and so discovering where our real Lines are is part of why I play.  However, there is a distinction between CROSSING a Line and PUSHING a Line. It has been my experience that Nobody Gets Hurt isn't just about respecting Lines as walls, but standing away from those Lines by a rather WIDE margin of error, "just in case". This is because the only way to find out where a person's real Line is, is to push and push which can only be done at the risk of crossing it.  I think that's an important distinction from simply willy-nilly diving over someone's Line.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165464/#Comment_165464" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T16:55:20+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  4:55PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2008 4:56PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I'm of the opinion that people are really bad at assessing where their own Lines REALLY are</blockquote>\nI agree, and because our group gets together to hang out and play some games at the end of a stressful week, we dig trenches where we think they might be.

Sorry, didn't notice.<br/><br/>I take this stuff seriously, having been in at least two situations where people I cared about had VERY rough times due to a Line-crossing. That crossing was easily avoidable, with a ten minute discussion pre-game.<br/>-----<br/>As for managing a pre-game discussion about L&amp;V in a LARP... um, I've never played in a non-con LARP that didn't have a long pre-game prep--online and in person--to make characters, do safety checks on weapons and kit, and establish safe combat tests/training and rules in play and so-forth. Further, the pre-game stuff could trivially include a question of "what subject matter is off-limits for you?" and have everyone's responses be communicated in the game materials, at the web site, etc. And that's for 200-person LARPs, even.<br/><br/>I just don't buy that it's too-tough of a logistical issue to take the time to avoid hurting unwilling people--I find it rather shocking how many folks these past couple of days actively oppose this basic premise. Is that the "punk" part of indie games showing (I signed up for the "hippie" part)?<br/><br/>At a con game, the game description will typically explain all potentially troublesome subject matter, and folks whose Lines are crossed just don't play in it (or, really, more often, a con LARP just won't cross any "common" tough Lines). You'd have every right to demand your money back and immediately leave--game-breaking or not--if a LARP didn't notify you of difficult subject matter then thrust it into your face out of the blue (and you can bet the general backlash online and to the con organizers would pretty much kibosh future LARPs by the same group of GMs).<br/>-----<br/>In closing, I don't really have a problem if a Line becomes a trench, in NOGH play--no one is supposed to get hurt, right; so why try to skirt close to the fire, even though you'll only get a bit singed and not third-degree burns? As JD said, what benefit is there to such teasing of people's Lines, really? Self-discovery? All well and good... in IWNAY play. If we've established NOGH play, then just be respectful and stay the hell away from the Lines. It's not likely to ameliorate the person you hurt--whose Line was "no child abuse"--if you abuse goblin whelps and profess, "Hey! These are monsters, not the implicit human child you meant by 'child abuse'!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165688/#Comment_165688" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T10:04:34+00:00" title="August 27, 2008 10:04AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, roleplaying games are very serious business.
