However, most of us don't seem to actually play it very often, at least not anymore. There are three things I want to look at in this thread:<br/><br/>1) Where does GURPS sometimes/often fall down on the job? Specifically, what are the aspects <i>of the design*</i> that lead to boredom or dysfunction with reasonable consistency?<br/><br/>2) Yes, GURPS can "do anything," but which genres is it <i>best</i> for? <br/><br/>3) How could we modify it to be more consistently fun? I'm aiming for solutions that <i>minimally</i> modify the core mechanics.<br/><br/>My tentative answers:<br/><br/>1) a) I think even if the GM/group does a good job of cutting out needless options ("no, you can't play a flying monkey with a laser gun! this is an epic fantasy, dumbass!"), and everyone is jazzed to play the same type of adventure, the rules of GURPS don't really provide any forward momentum to play.<br/><br/>b) Except for certain skills, there's not always a good sense of what a single roll gets you.<br/><br/>c) Less of an issue but still bothersome, to me at least, is what happens when skills rise above 16. Unless modifiers are applied, your probability of success just stays at that 98% level forever.<br/><br/>2) I loved the idea in the other thread of using GURPS to run D&amp;D modules! It's sorta-kinda going in the opposite direction from using something like Dungeon World to run old modules. <br/><br/>Certainly mashups of various sorts are also pretty appealing (I think Paul mentioned A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court \u2014 sweet!).<br/><br/>I would tend to stay away from genres that are primarily interpersonal, like romance or comedies of manners. We have better tools for that sort of thing, like Emily's three games about relationships, some of Ben Lehman's stuff, etc. I also think that certain genres, done with GURPS in any kind of mechanically meaningful way, would involve engaging in some slow and clunky and overly math-y sub-systems like Vehicle creation. (Imagine trying to play a Driver in AW using GURPS...)<br/><br/>3) a) Here's an idea to modify the reward system, always one of the weakest components of the game.<br/><br/>i) CP are earned by accomplishing goals. The party sets a goal, and each character sets a personal goal as well. (Or maybe two of each. Two group goals and one personal goal seems good.) At the end of the session, you earn 1-3 CP if you worked towards the goal, depending on how much progress you made, and 5 CP if you completed it. (These numbers might need to be tweaked. I could see 1-2 for working towards and 4 for completion working better.) If the party abandons a goal in an appropriately dramatic fashion, same reward as for completion, but there's no changing your mind about this.<br/><br/>ii) Every time a Disad comes up in play, <i>in a meaningfully inconvenient fashion</i> (no playing baseball for an hour with your Dependent** little brother!), gain a bonus die. Each player keeps a cup in front of them to hold their bonus dice. Bonus dice can be spent up to 2 at a time on other rolls; used on yourself, it becomes "roll and take the 3 lowest," used on an enemy, it becomes "roll and take the 3 highest." The reason I think it's important to be able to spend your bonus dice to jinx enemy rolls is because of the way defenses work in combat; a well-constructed baddie might be very hard to take down otherwise. Anyway, 5-point Disads grant 1 bonus die, 10-pointers grant 2, and 15-pointers grant 3.<br/><br/>Max 1 Disad per scene per player (to prevent someone from taking 8 5-pointers), and no using bonus dice on rolls incurred by Disads (like Will rolls to resist Addiction).<br/><br/>iii) I'd treat Quirks the way Character Traits are handled in Burning Wheel. Did something interesting happen in play this session because of one of your Quirks? Get an extra CP. Be strict with this\u2014it's got to be something that directed the story in a reasonable way, and it's got to be something that you didn't already earn a bonus die or CP from.<br/><br/>b) This is easily solved by applying Say Yes or Roll and Let it Ride.<br/><br/>c) Only likely to be a problem in superheroic*** or really long-term play. I'd be inclined to make them an additional source of bonus dice. "If you have a skill of 17 or above, any time you take -5 or worse to your roll due to circumstantial modifiers, gain a bonus die." (22 or above? Modifiers need to be at least -10.) This encourages people with ridiculous skills to try truly heroic and setting-changing things with them.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*And not, say, of the GM being a jerk or one of the players hating the genre or whatever.<br/><br/>**Actually, Dependents often struck me as being like Weirdness Magnet, as in, more of an adventure hook than a true Disad. Same with Enemies.<br/><br/>***Another genre we already have better games for.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392491/#Comment_392491" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-05T15:24:54+00:00" title="October  5, 2012  3:24PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>1) Where does GURPS sometimes/often fall down on the job?

And I mean that in the sense of "Flight Simulator Game".<br/><br/>GURPS doesn't really <i>emulate</i>, in the sense of "Genre Emulation".<br/><br/>So it does hard science fiction better than soft.  It can do instant-death-on-the-line Black Ops beautifully.  It does gritty details.  <br/><br/>The limit of this?   Welllllll.....  It can do Noir, but it's an edge case.  It can do several classic sorts of fantasy - Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser falls inside the range, here, as do many other kinds of fantasy that started life as detail-oriented books; the focus will trend a certain way, but it's not <i>wrong</i>.  But Avatar: The Last Airbender, say?  Will never, ever feel right if done in GURPS, unless you are so familiar with it that the system is transparent to you.  Ditto many other fictions, especially "modern" ones.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can boil it down to a clean set of axioms, beyond the Simulator/Emulator one, and those are sadly pretty loaded words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392494/#Comment_392494" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-05T15:50:56+00:00" title="October  5, 2012  3:50PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Loaded they may be, but I think you're absolutely right.

It's a common meme that "GURPS is for low powered gritty games and HERO is for superheroes" but in my experience with the right set of switches flipped either one works well for either style.  <br/><br/>GURPS had as one of its explicit, early design goals, to attempt to simulate the real world.  As in, if there was a question about how something worked, and there was a real world way to test it, someone would go out in the real world with a tape measure and a stopwatch or whatever and test it.  Over the years there were plenty of clashes between that and a fun, exciting game, which is how a lot of optional rules grew up.  Sort of the same process HERO came up with, in reverse; HERO started as superheroic action, and in the early editions there were some rules and lots of GM advice on how to make the game more like the comics, but when they started on the non-superheroic genres (espionage, fantasy, SF, etc.) they needed optional rules to handle things like concussions and bleeding.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392500/#Comment_392500" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-05T16:41:06+00:00" title="October  5, 2012  4:41PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good questions, Matt.<br/><br/>The main issue I see with GURPS is a heavy focus on correct emulation/simulation (the flow of the fiction/game world, and its verisimilitude), without much attention paid to the gameplay (or the actual processes carried out by the real human beings around the table). <br/><br/>So, to make it into a game that supports "story"-oriented play, you need to add or change something, since the game itself provides no support I can think for the actual process of play. (Disads that are plot hooks are the only exception that comes to mind at the moment.)<br/><br/>I think that I would personally favour GURPS as a kind of high-simulation, high-Challenge game. In Forge terms, that would be on the edge between heavy Simulationist play and heavy Gamist play, with the game falling one way or the other depending on the people involved. (Playing D&amp;D modules using GURPS's rather unforgiving combat rules would be a good example of this style of play: I envision it as unashamedly Step on Up play, with serious challenges being thrown at the players, and ultimately their wits and creativity are being challenged.)<br/><br/>That suggests certain modifications to me:<br/><br/>For instance, I would want character advancement (which you could define as *earning* Character Points, or alternately as *spending* them, for different effects) to always tie into the fiction.<br/><br/>You get to alter your character when you accomplish certain things, like learning a new skill (involves exposure, training, time, resources, etc), cementing a new Advantage (like, say, social status), or improving some attributes (also probably training of some form of another). That way, you as a player are focused on challenging fictional situations and improving your character's position/skills/resources in order to deal with those situations better, and the CPs/improvements flow naturally from that.<br/><br/>As for high skill values, I have a few thoughts on that:<br/><br/>1. There ARE certain skills where your skill level matters more than your odds of success or failure, like learning languages (you rarely make a roll, but your skill level determines how heavy your accent is) and casting spells (where your skill level determines how costly the spell is to cast, and how much concentration is necessary).<br/><br/>2. I believe that GURPS is at its best if skill modifiers are used heavily (for almost any roll), so that you're rarely rolling just your skill value. For the odds to "make sense", modifiers should range from about +10 (for an easy, routine task) to -10 (for a really long shot), instead of the usual -2/+2 range we might be used to in a lot of games operating on a similar range of numbers (like d20 games). If this is the case, the difference between skill 16 and skill 20 will often be a factor.<br/><br/>(The rules for ranged combat are a good example of this principle: almost any roll will take modifiers covering that rather large -10/+10-ish range, as that's what's necessary to make the probabilities feel and look right. It's a lot of math, yes, but I think it makes the system really work. Ranged combat is an area where someone really checked out the odds and made appropriate numbers for modifiers.)<br/><br/>3. One "house rule" that I was always very fond of was the rule for "maneuvers" (I put "house rule" in brackets, because I'm pretty sure it was in the official books somewhere, but not 100% sure). The way these worked, once your skill got high enough that advancing it any further wasn't doing anything interesting, you'd instead spend points learning "maneuvers", which were basically tricks or techniques. Each "maneuver" allowed you to ignore certain penalties. For example, you might have a Climbing skill or 18, and a 4-point Maneuver of Ice Climbing or something, so you could ignore up to 4 points of penalties when climbing in icy places.<br/><br/>That made high skill more interesting: if you were investing a LOT in a certain skill, you'd have to specialize and define your character a little more (are you more experienced with free climbing, or ice climbing, or rope skills?). It would also jive well with the principle I suggest above, where you advance your character according to what happens in the fiction, so that your training and experience is reflected in the maneuvers you learn or practice in play.<br/><br/>Finally, one thing that always bothered me in GURPS was the way the game handled "Passive Defense": in my experience, it made defensive tactics for unarmoured people nearly useless/hopeless, since they needed to leave room for those PD bonuses not to break the bell curve. On the other hand, someone who did pile on the armour could be basically untouchable, leading to uninteresting combats in the other direction.<br/><br/>My solution would be to increase basic defense odds, but to scrap Passive Defense (including it as a penalty to the attack roll, if necessary), leaving DR as the factor which determines whether your armour stops incoming attacks or not. This way the value of (for instance) armour-penetrating weapons isn't removed arbitrarily by a Passive Defense value (which would normally be the case even against weapons that could easily penetrate your armour).<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392501/#Comment_392501" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-05T16:45:46+00:00" title="October  5, 2012  4:45PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2012 4:46PM by Paul_T.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

Create your character sheet and then kiss it goodbye, because the GM is never going to let you see it again.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392511/#Comment_392511" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-05T23:47:03+00:00" title="October  5, 2012 11:47PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2012 11:49PM by timfire.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're open to narrativist / story-now play, a classic technique is to create a character with various skills / advantages / disadvantages / etc that are odds with one another, and then have the GM create situations that plays off the inherent tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392519/#Comment_392519" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T03:48:58+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  3:48AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gurps is a basic pass/fail target-number mechanic, right?

I don't see how this suggestion would really address my concern about the game engine failing to drive play forward. Like, sure, it means that die rolls are more likely to generate an interesting fictional result; great! But it doesn't, by itself, help us get into interesting situations where we want to be rolling in the first place.

("Climb the Forbidden Peak; Rescue the Princess; Become Mayor; Kill the Agent," etc)<br/><br/>Some combination of accomplishing goals and other things allows you to improve things on your character sheet. Maybe you get a certain number of character points simply for showing up (per session played), or even for MAKING goals and committing to them. ("I'm committing myself to destroying the bandit hideout in the woods." "OK, here's 5 CPs up-front, 5 more when you succeed. If you fail before midnight on October 5th - when the bandits plan to kill their hostages - you owe the full 10 CPs.")<br/><br/>That's making me imagine something not too unlike Ben Robbins's "West Marches" idea, where the players set goals and organize sessions to attempt those goals, in a sandbox of the .<br/><br/>Or maybe make in-character goals into Disadvantages, recreating Keys?<br/><br/><i>"Disadvantage: Driven by a desire to become president on the Company. (-5 points)<br/><br/>You really want to be the president, it's your driving passion in life.<br/><br/>Gain a CP every time you [...]<br/><br/>Gain 10 CPs if you succeed in becoming president. Use those CPs to purchase the High Status Advantage [...]"</i><br/><br/>Alternatively, the GM would set out goals, and let the players choose from a menu. A whole list of challenges, with CP rewards for each, and let the players take them on.<br/><br/>But I'm just blabbering here, I haven't thought this out at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392588/#Comment_392588" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T21:14:24+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  9:14PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I definitely like the idea, and forgot to mention it earlier (although I believe this is canon GURPS) that you can only spend CP on things that are relevant to that adventure.
