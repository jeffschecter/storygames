                    Okay, so over in <a href="denied:â€http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2430â€" rel="nofollow">The Great Divide</a> thread, Matt suggests that there is this divide between two RPG markets that have historically been conflated: those who enjoy creation and challenging old forms, and those who enjoy partaking and celebrating in the forms created by others.<br/><br/>Those who enjoy partaking and celebrating content and doing so in an interactive medium used to worship their (creative-type) GMs and buy lots and lots of game supplements, but now they are better and more conveniently serviced by Massively Multiplayer Online games, such as <em>World of Warcraft</em> or Xbox Live.<br/><br/>Creative types, by contrast, are attracted to indie and story games.  Indie and story games allow all of the participants to be creative collaboratively.  The players serve as their own audience for the creative endeavor.<br/><br/>Assuming that the far larger market of partake-and-celebrate folks continues to drain away out of the RPG hobby, we are left with just the create-and-challenge folks.  If we are to make a market out of <em>just</em> them, rather than assuming they and their partake-and-celebrate friends play together, weâ€™re looking at a pretty fundamental shift in the market.  Itâ€™s much smaller, first of all, and more spread out, but these are logistical concerns â€“ large ones, but relatively straightforward.<br/><br/>The question that comes to me, though, is whether or not you can really build a market of creative people who have no audience but each other.  Is six people getting together to collaborate on something that no one else will ever see going to be fulfilling enough to keep those six people participating in the hobby (with or without staying in the same group)?  Or does a fundamental piece of human creativity require an audience to show it to?<br/><br/>We can talk in abstract all day long, but if this participants=audience thing does work, one assumes that it occurs elsewhere, somewhere.  I asked the question: what other communities practice highly creative, highly collaborative hobbies in which there is no audience outside of the participants?  Have any of these communities lasted more than a single generation, thereby implying that the activity itself, rather than the friendships of participants, was the core of the community?<br/><br/>So far, we have:<br/>Garage Bands with no intent on ever playing for an audience.  I am skeptical of their existence, but Iâ€™d like to hear more.<br/>Poetry Slams in which the entire audience is assumed to be stepping up to the mike at some point during the night.<br/>The Society for Creative Anachronism, which is in its second (and sometimes third) generation, has people make period clothing, dress up, act funny, play-fight, cook period food, and camp.<br/><br/>There may be other examples.  Iâ€™d love to hear them.<br/><br/>The question for this thread is: is this the shape of RPGs to come?  What lessons can we learn from these examples?  What changes will need to be made to RPGs to approximate these cultural phenomena?<br/><br/>Seriously, the common thread I see between all three examples thus far is sex.  Status within the community figures into the latter two.  Food, too.  Another common denominator is <em>expression of self</em>, which is actually downplayed in most RPGs.                </div>

                            There's a small, obscure movement in the out-of-the-mainstream bit of Christianity that I hang out in, known as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_worship" rel="nofollow">alt.worship</a>" which is participatory, creative and decentralized. It's more often expressed in terms of people who previously were audience becoming participants than the other way round. We think of ourselves as cutting-edge and some of us call ourselves the "Emerging Church", but it may well turn out that we're a temporary blip rather than the way of the future. It's mostly a Gen-X (and younger) thing. We joke about being "hippies".<br/><br/>Hey, that sounds a bit like another community I participate in. What do you know?<br/><br/>(I had actually noticed that before.)<br/><br/>Seriously, though, I think this is part and parcel with the Web 2.0 phenomenon and the increased culture of participation that's slowly growing worldwide. Weinberger's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Small-Pieces-Loosely-Joined-Unified/dp/0738208507/sr=8-1/qid=1171584433/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5367440-9141608?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">Small Pieces Loosely Joined</a> makes some good points about it which I <a href="http://cityside.org.nz/node/168" rel="nofollow">talk about here</a>. Expression of self, participation, authenticity, engagement, exploration are the themes I see coming out.<br/><br/>Is this the shape of RPGs to come? I believe and hope so.<br/><br/>What lessons can we learn? <br/>* That it's still important to have people with high levels of creativity to create spaces for people with lower levels of creativity to participate meaningfully. <br/>* That you never know what you'll get. <br/>* That it's essential, in fact, not to define what you mustn't get, apart from what is minimally necessary to keep the whole thing from melting down in mutual acrimony. <br/>* That what you get won't be anything like perfect, but it will be real. <br/>* That the process is the important thing, not the product, if there even is a product. <br/>* That we're more than just consumers.<br/><br/>What changes need to be made to RPGs to approximate this? <br/>* The GM needs to fade into the background and become a facilitator, but probably not disappear entirely except in groups where everyone is reasonably experienced at being creative for themselves. <br/>* There need to be multiple "ways in" to engage with the material from different angles and in different ways, to suit people's differing levels of commitment and ability as well as their various ways of thinking. <br/>* Building on past material that is time-tested and possibly familiar is a good start, alongside the innovation (I just this moment realized that I have <a href="http://csidemedia.com/work.php?work_id=212" rel="nofollow">Awesome-o-fied the rosary</a>). <br/>* You can assemble things from diverse sources and they'll just work together, if you expect them to.                        </div>

                            Actually, JBR, my experience suggests otherwise. There's a LOT of sex in the more "creator" side of my gaming history. I would consider that RP was flirting for me with 3 of the last 4 people I slept with. See also anecdotal evidence from a number of others in the SG-world that I know of. Brand just posted about this. Vincent is talking about it sideways right now. I seem to recall Meguey and Emily bringing it up last year. Creativity is sexy. The only other things I've done socially that had as much sexual tension have been community theater, pagan rituals, and Rocky Horror.                        </div>

<p>All the people I've ever seen who were in garage bands that had few or no gigs stayed in the band because it gave them bragging rights, which leads to prestige, which often leads to sex. Of course, the fact that they have no gigs doesn't mean they have no audience other than themselves; girlfriends or potential girlfriends often drop by.</p>
<p>Joshua:</p>
<p>You need to check out the online communities built around The Sims games. Yeah, it's a computer game, but it lets you take snapshots and assemble them into photo albums that you can upload. There are hundreds of photo albums online, telling various stories. The key features of this community are:</p>
<ul>
<li>people with low levels of creativity can still participate;</li>
<li>aside from purchasing the game and owning a computer capable of running it, there's very little effort required;</li>
<li>you can participate at any time; there's no restrictions based on other people's schedules;</li>
<li>a core group of highly-creative people contribute clothes and "recolors" for other players to use;</li>
<li>it's not an elitist community; there's a wide range of personalities and backgrounds.</li>

                            I amend: LARP is, indeed, all about the booty.<br/><br/>Mark, the games that were powered by sexual tension -- were they indie games, or mainstream games?  Sexuality appears in indie games a lot; it appears implicitly and subliminally in the mainstream, but not (in my experience) explicitly to the point where there's real actual sexual tension.  However, my experience may be off, here.  This may be one of those bits that indie games are doing right -- not that indie games are all about the booty, but that indie games assume sexuality is an intrinsic part of identity, character, humanity, etc.<br/><br/>John, how much of that Sims community <em>collaborates</em> together?  Do people make photo albumns together or in teams?                        </div>

                            Joshua, trad games, but with groups containing a preponderance of "creatives". Vampire, Call of Cthulhu, AD&amp;D. This was mostly prior to ever playing anything Indie, and one of the people in question is violently allergic to anything with even a whiff of the Forgie about it. It's really, really not about the games themselves or the content as much as the intimacy and social charge generated by creative effort. The CoC game had a ton of sexual charge, but the subject matter was decidedly unerotic. It was the trust and emotional intensity that made it sexy.                        </div>

<p>I haven't explored all the methods of collaboration that might be happening in the Sims community, but here's what I know about:</p>
<ol>
<li>those able to create custom content (skins, eyes, clothing, object recolors, and hacked content like hair) sometimes work in artistic teams to make themed sets, or take requests from the rest of the community that can't create satisfactory custom content; the rest of the community uses that custom content in stories. In fact, I specifically remember people asking for medical sets or school sets so that they could create stories in hospitals and schools.</li>
<li>using just the tools built into the game, people create individual sims, families, or full houses and upload them to the website for other people to use.</li>
<li>the community creates challenges that everyone can participate in, either by uploading a particularly difficult house setup or by describing rules you have to abide by and score yourself on, like the Ethiopian Challenge (no refrigerators or other food-preparation objects on the lot, no electric items, no buying dinner at restaurants.) People often upload albums of their challeges. For example, there's the Freewill Hostel Challenge, where you make an extremely well-stocked home, create sims under strict guidelines, then let them fend for themselves for ten hours of real-time. I actually did this a couple times and <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/exchange/story_detail.php?asset_id=80960&amp;asset_type=story&amp;user_id=2326628" rel="nofollow">uploaded the photo albums</a> (OK, I only uploaded five hours worth for that family, because I haven't captioned the other pictures yet. <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/exchange/story_detail.php?asset_id=80746&amp;asset_type=story&amp;user_id=2326628" rel="nofollow">here's another family album with a full ten hours' run</a>.)</li>
</ol>

<p>I feel like most crafty hobbies are creative/collaborative/audienceless. Those that are performative are exceptional.</p>
<p>I also feel like my younger sisters and their peers engage less in these hobbies than my age group did, and we did less than those of our friends slightly older than us, with the balance being filled out by media consumption. So the predominant emphasis on that audience-and-performer relationship is, I think, a cultural shift that's going on <em>right now as we speak,</em> at least within my community.</p>

                            What do you mean by creative? I can think of one community... Greenland style kayak rollers in the US who are a small group of paddlers devoted to creatively rolling their kayaks, having competitions about who can do more rolls, and friendly get-togethers among themselves. Not much interest in this subset of paddling in the larger paddling community.<br/><br/>But, because of their strong devotion to this sport of rolling, some very useful techniques have transfered into the larger paddling community, including new ways to teach rolling, and some new bracing techniques for rough water. And a few niche manufacturers building paddling gear specifically for the Greenland paddlers and this gear is spilling over into mainstream paddling.<br/><br/>All of the later could be applied to the RPG hobby.                        </div>

<p>Bryan's got a good point. Creativity can mean different things. When indie designers talk about creativity, it seems to me that it's something very high-end and personal. But if you think about, say, ordinary people playing a pickup game of basketball or football or something, there's a kind of creativity there, too. It's the unexpected way people build on what's already happened. If you call that first kind of creativity "imagination", I think you can see why Ryan Dancey said that the majority of roleplayers don't care about imagination. They care about enjoying an established world and, indirectly, the second kind of creativity, which I would call "spontaneity".</p>
<p>I get the feeling that some of us get too hung up on the interpersonal part of roleplaying. These people we're talking about, the ones who drop out of roleplaying because it's easier to play World of Warcraft, they feel the same way about interpersonal communication as they do about imagination: yeah, if it happens, it's good, but that's not the main reason they play the game. If either interpersonal communication or imagination were their main goal, they have other more direct ways of meeting that goal. They play WoW because they can log on at any time and play even if they don't meet up with anyone else. I imagine it's the same with Second Life (it's synchronous, sure, but you can also just explore, anytime you feel like it.) It's certainly the case with The Sims, which has interpersonal communication, but that's not necessary... and, in fact, The Sims Online (which <em>had</em> the missing synchronous communication) failed.</p>
<p>Most of the pastimes and hobbies we've been talking about that "don't have an audience other than the participants" can actually have an accidental audience, it's just not the main point of the activity.</p>

                            I don't have time to compose a long response right now, but I think MikeRM is right in invoking Web 2.0 here. I'm highly skeptical of the "rpg as spectator sport" idea. It's been kicking around for a while, and I'm not sure we've seen a successful proof of concept. If it will work, however, I think a Web 2.0 approach, where we leverage the community's collective intelligence is the way to go. Maybe the first step is a Web app that collects links to actual play threads and lets people, link, share, and favorite them. Then we have a way, as a community, to find and identify great actual plays (I just read "Moose in the City" last night, and it actually had a pretty intense effect on me).<br/><br/>In fact, now that I've thought of it, I think I should probably build it.<br/><br/>Does anyone else think this is a good idea?  Did someone already build it while I wasn't looking?                        </div>

                            So here's a thought: for all those crafty communities, they do have a finished product to show off but it's not really the focus of the hobby.  In RPGs, we retell stories about our characters and games to other gamers, but it's not really the focus of the hobby.  Parallel?<br/><br/>Sports are probably a closer parallel to gaming than anything else on the list, I'm thinking.  You play sports in order to get out, do something with friends, stretch your muscles, show off, team up, win... these all sound really really familiar (especially when you think of 'stretch your muscles' as 'stretch your creative muscles).                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>LARP is, indeed, all about the booty.</blockquote>
I resent the notion of "all", or the little feminist in me does. LARPs drawn in a larger percentage of female players than tabletop playing - or, I suppose, sports and garage bands. Not that I'd personally and platonically have anything against players of both genders being drawn in by sex. There is certainly a strong undercurrence of it in LARPing.<br/><br/>Related to that; there's the huge aspect of being both social and creative, both inside and outside the game. It's probably not that far stretch from Second Life that Jason mentioned. There's a subtle (or maybe not that subtle) difference between that type of social during a LARP compared to social aspects of tabletop playing during the game.                        </div>

I must now leave this community to begin my career as a motorcycle-riding art student gladiator.<br/><br/>For the census-takers, I too have gotten laid as a result of online RP. On the other hand I stopped LARPing because the booty-focus was too overwhelming.                        </div>

                            When you're riding that bike, don't forget to take up rock climbing, because rock climbers are always getting laid -- as easy as saying, "Have you ever rock climbed before?" "No" "Well, would you like to?"

Well, if there is a parallel, I don't know, but Greenland style kayakers build their own kayaks, often to their own bodies dimensions instead of to a plan, and they make all kinds of other gear and show it off to each other. The Skin-On-Frame kayaks are quite beautiful, I have one, and they draw a ton of attention from people on beaches. But the gear is an means to an end -- whereas the focus is the rolling and the paddling.                        </div>

                            I've been expounding a theory that comes from some stuff that Chris Lerich posted over at The Forge a couple of years back. Here's the short version. Before books (before the European Church, really) we told stories to each other in order to transmit values. Shaman's telling stories, or just father's to sons, whatever. With books and centralized religion, you get one version of a story told over and over, and no creative input from the reader, nor feedback. It's a one way transmission process. And I'm not going to be judgmental about that either - to each their own.<br/>
<br/>
But I think that the urge to be a shaman, or at least to transmit values orally through "story" is a strong urge. And that we've accidentally rediscovered it through RPGs. So Mike's association with his "decentralized religion" is spot on. It's all about sharing your values with people who are empowered to provide instant feedback in a social way. With an audience in a theater, you may get applause or boos, but you don't have a social context for that feedback. You don't know that it's Brand telling you that something is wrong, and so you don't know why. That's key to this personal format.<br/>
<br/>
I'd almost go so far as to say that it's a superior form, but that would be my bias showing. Let's just say that nothing fits the particular goals in question like a RPG does.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and BTW, if you've ever wondered why RPG discussions about mode of play and such can become so heated? It's because they are precisely the same thing as discussions about religion. It's questioning how somebody does their value transmission in play.<br/>
<br/>
Mike<br/>
<br/>
P.S. While Ron's professional theory on evolution would say (quite correctly, IMO), that everything devolves in some way to reproductive imperatives, it's often quite pointless to point this out. We can take it as assumed, and then look at the particular derivative need in question. We have to eat, too, in order to live to reproduce, but that doesn't make eating the same as playing RPGs.                        </div>

I suspect that one of the factors at work is that many (perhaps most) people actually don't want to transmit their values through their storytelling. They want to echo those beliefs around among their peers, getting back reinforcement of their group membership.

Oh, absolutely.  I read "transmit values" as "articulate beliefs as participation in a larger group identity."  That can be challenging, but it is probably more often reinforcing.                        </div>

Sorry, the discussion slipped off the page.  Hope you weren't holding your breath.<br><br/>So, a couple lessons for gaming (not necessarily design) from BDSM (a subject on which I am not claiming authority):
<ul>
<li>Safe words.  Not so obvious: it makes it possible to go to the edge.<br/></li><li>Your first job is to take care of the other players.  When they know that, they can trust themselves to you.<br/></li><li>Players should have solid ideas for their goals in a scene.<br/></li><li>It's important that the play area and materials be clean and free of abrasive particles.<br/></li></ul>
Also, while I've happened across a lot of the above kind of advice, I've yet to see any discussion of "BDSM theory" - maybe that's a lesson, too.<br/><br/>First and foremost though: performance for the sake of the performers is an existing pattern in human society.  You don't have to look that hard.  So I think I've answered the question of your original post: 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Is six people getting together to collaborate on something that no one else will ever see going to be fulfilling enough to keep those six people participating in the hobby (with or without staying in the same group)?  Or does a fundamental piece of human creativity require an audience to show it to?</blockquote>
My philosophical answer is that human beings are creative all the time.  It's right after breathing.  Reduction to consumerism is the artificial state, seems to me.                        </br></div>
