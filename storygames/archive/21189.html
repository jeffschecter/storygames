Roll with advantage. If either d20 comes up a 1, however, the item is "used up": worn out, in need of a recharge, played out, etc. It won't bring you any further benefit until you take action to restock or repair it.<br/><br/>This counts for more abstract items, too, like a notarized document from the constable. You can wave it around and make life easier, but eventually it's going to wear thin. Roll a 1 and people are going to stop caring about it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464215/#Comment_464215" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-20T17:22:16+00:00" title="June 20, 2017  5:22PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a similar vein, THE BLACK HACK has a usage die mechanic.<br/><br/>Whenever you use an expendable item, roll its usage die. If it comes up a 1 or 2, reduce the size of the usage die. If you roll a 1 or 2 on a d4, the item is spent.<br/><br/>This prevents you from having to track torches and rations and arrows and stuff. I realize it's a little different than what you're aiming for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
