One of my best gaming buddies, she tends to make sociopathic/psychopathic lonely killing machines no matter what the system or setting is. So I usually have a talk for the benefit of everyone at the table as to the theme and tone, so that there's no confusion later.<br/><br/>In one samurai-themed (with an anime tone) game I ran, the first combat ended with a player describing the gory beheading of a mook enemy, as if it were a Takashi Miike movie. I had to stop the game there for a sec and have a brief discussion of theme/tone. It wasn't a line/veil thing really (although excessive gore does squick me out unless it's made in the laughable B-movie tongue-in-cheek cinema of Japan appeal like RoboGeisha or Machine Girl), but it clearly was a "the theme/tone of this game does not match what is in at least one person's head".<br/><br/>So we stopped, I mentioned the theme (adventure, personal struggle, justice) the tone (PG-13ish, violence and blood without monstrous gore, etc), everyone nodded their heads, and we were back in the game.<br/><br/>But for the most part, if it's a new game others don't have experience with that has a definite setting, theme etc I'll describe it for everyone at character generation. If it's a relatively generic game (Burning Wheel, Sorcerer frex) I'll especially spend time discussing the themes and tone to make sure we're all on the same page, otherwise the assumed theme is going to be "the same as the last time I played the game, albeit back then it was a different GM and group...".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350710/#Comment_350710" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T14:44:18+00:00" title="December  6, 2011  2:44PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually talk about it only in character-specific terms.

It's because this is the theme of 99% of all games played since 1977, and that's a little embarrassing. (My favorite part of <i>Showdown</i> is how it recapitulates this theme and then productively deconstructs it.)<br/><br/>The likelihood that I will explicitly discuss themes with my fellow players is inversely proportional to the probability we'll be talking about sociopathic violence. Generally, a discussion of theme is sublimated into a discussion of system, instead. Sociopathic violence is what we talk about when we talk about D&amp;D; general systemantics is what we talk about when we talk about <i>Paranoia</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350796/#Comment_350796" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T13:11:30+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  1:11PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>I usually talk about it only in character-specific terms.

I'm running a campaign right now where a relationship between two NPCs struck me as especially poignant, and I considered setting up something to bring this further into the story (I'm aware that it's basically irrelevant game-wise, as long as the players aren't enjoying it), but this is about the only time I can recall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350832/#Comment_350832" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T16:31:24+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  4:31PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aside: Whenever people talk about D&amp;D, its seems like they're talking about a game which I've never played, which is funny, because I thought I  had played it a lot over the last 20+ years.<br/><br/>Theme: When I do talk about it, it explodes in my face, as the people I've played with have a tendency to push too hard at it when they're being conscious about it. I've found its best to keep my ideas of theme to myself and use them as a basis for personal decision making, which then floats to the top as the game emerges. As it floats, it picks-up/mutates with other people's "themes" and in retrospect there's something there that we can all see as the theme of the game. It kind of sucks though, because occasionally I know I want to play a game about X, Y or Z and its very hard to do that indirectly unless there's already a system out there that pushes very hard for the sort of thing I want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350852/#Comment_350852" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T18:20:26+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  6:20PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a funny question for me currently because in our current game (of Apocalypse World) I am playing a character who is very big on explicitly speculating about the meaning of people's actions, how society operates, etc., and basically blurting out thematic questions at inappropriate moments. (He's loosely schizophrenic.) So my answer to the question at the moment is: I talk about it in character. <br/><br/>Of course the spontaneous, incoherent observations of my Battlebabe are not really the same as my own views as a player re: the themes of the game, but there is overlap sometimes. In an email discussion about the game recently one of the players (I think the MC?) mentioned some emergent themes they had noticed in the game, and I laughed because at least one of them was something my character had spent some part of the first session discussing with another NPC.<br/><br/>As for myself in other games, I like to talk a bit about potential themes up-front, but as others have mentioned it is only really once the game-fiction itself has started to have its say that any sort of theme-related-statements are likely to emerge for discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350902/#Comment_350902" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T08:28:38+00:00" title="December  8, 2011  8:28AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2011 8:29AM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it's almost always observational stuff like Vincent's\u2014"have you noticed" or "hey, I just realized that" or "are you two intentionally pulling on two ends of the same theme with these characters?" I work pretty hard at asking these questions in ways that don't alter the dynamic too much... but neither do I ask the questions until I think the dynamic is pretty well formed so that I'm not meddling with something while it bakes. <br/><br/>Once I feel like a theme has emerged, though, I either lean on it with NPCs and decision points related to that theme, to highlight it and throw it into relief, or I mention it outright in the player-to-player conversation and see which way that causes it to spin. Sometimes, also, I just cant help myself and I say something, like, "That's awesome\u2014we've come back to the theme of the state versus the family again; did you do that on purpose?" Yeah, that sometimes puts too much weight on an idea and then it gets overburdened and begins to sag, but often not. <br/><br/>Sometimes I talk about theme up front, too, but always, always, always I look for themes I can bring out of the characters the players give me. They're always there, they're just not always immediately compatible. In my last playtest campaign for <i>Razed</i>, for example, the two main PCs mostly had different themes and inherent conflicts but we sort of wrapped it up in the end by turning themes of duty and understanding into questions of trust and control and the lack thereof.<br/><br/>Themes emerge. They're emergent. You can steer a thing so that certain themes are built in, of course, but just putting onions in your recipe doesn't mean they'll necessarily caramelize.<br/><br/>(I'm avoiding a tangent here where I talk about motifs, which are theme-adjacent but not the same.)<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350968/#Comment_350968" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T21:18:11+00:00" title="December  8, 2011  9:18PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm fairly explicit and brief about it during character generation; most of the folks I game with are either experienced (and pick up on it quickly) or are inexperienced and looking for pointers. After that, if I'm doing my job as GM, it'll emerge naturally. <br/><br/>Many times, as in The Creepy Game (which is what I called Wonderland before I ran it so as not to bias people), just having an expectation will help the PCs get into the theme more effectively. They knew that I might or might not be lying to them about their characters going insane. In my current D&amp;D game it took a long time for the theme to develop; the PCs are very much Not Good People and are working for Very Bad People that they will eventually betray. It has a great feel that's just starting to come out after ten sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350972/#Comment_350972" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T23:12:47+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 11:12PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2011 11:13PM by Hans_c-o.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I expect the game to do this for me. When I sit down to play Freemarket, for example, I know what it's about: the particular brand of transhumanism that asks, "what will you do in a post-scarcity society?"<br/><br/>I'm playing Sorcerer right now, and in between the premise of "How far will you go to get what you want?" and our group's definition of Humanity (the making of which is a part of the rules) as Authenticity, I think we've got our theme right there.<br/><br/>Maybe this is just another way of saying, "I let the theme emerge through play"? Am I mixing up "theme" and "premise"? I do learning best through discussion, and I've never had a face-to-face discussion on this stuff, so forgive my obtuseness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350974/#Comment_350974" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T23:20:42+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 11:20PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the way Ron (Edwards) puts forward theme. In my own words (and, who knows, maybe this is not what he's saying at all but my own idea--I'm not too sure):<br/><br/>* Outlining theme explicitly is a big, rough, indelicate tool. It may work, it may not. You can talk about it, say what it is, but then play can easily drift away from there, or you can leave it unsaid and end up there anyway.<br/><br/>* Talking about the fiction and what makes it tick for you--conflict, characters, situations, moral dilemmas, all that stuff--will most likely funnel you towards theme. So create fiction, create characters and situations, that grab you and make you wonder what will happen next. All that fictional stuff that grabs you, that creates a certain mood, that stuff might be a better tool, a more refined (and more relevant) tool for getting everyone on the same page about theme, while still leaving room to surprise you with the results.<br/><br/>That said, I've gotten a lot of mileage out of trying to figure out what kinds of themes drive particular characters, and (as GM, usually), giving the player fictional material that relates to those themes. You tell me your character is an immigrant, fighting to fit in? I'll give him some rough immigrant gangsters who hate the local culture to bounce off of. And maybe some poor locals whose lives have been ruined in some way by people who have come from other countries and displaced them, taken their jobs, or otherwise put them in a bad spot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351006/#Comment_351006" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T06:50:38+00:00" title="December  9, 2011  6:50AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We only talk about it observationally and only after a campaign or storyline has reached its conclusion.<br/><br/>Otoh I *think* about theme, when I'm gming or facilitating, all the damned time.
