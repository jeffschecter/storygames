Making your own decisions about your products<br/>2. Making a bit of money from selling your stuff<br/><br/>Creative Commons works against both of those: because it leads to people sharing their stuff "but, hey, only if you share your stuff, too, and don't sell it".<br/><br/>What I particularly hate is that Creative Commons is the new hotness: so everyone releases their stuff under it, because it's cool, thereby placing restrictions on anyone who uses it.<br/><br/>By the way, to forestall an obvious objection: of course, I realise that I could email the author of a Creative Commons licensed-thing and ask if <br/>I could use it under another license. But I'd prefer that be the default: if I find something I want to use, I contact the author, and never mind all the Creative Commons stuff.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SpaceHobo" title="SpaceHobo"><img alt="SpaceHobo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zork.net/~nick/square32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SpaceHobo">SpaceHobo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104724/#Comment_104724" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T05:44:45+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  5:44AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a lover, and here are my hates about the CC licenses:<br/>\n<br/>\n  1. The fact that there are so many options to choose from makes the notion of being "CC Licensed" almost meaningless.  <br/>\n  2. The "non-commercial use only" clause is a mess.  It's a fuzzy concept with no strict definition, and it's just an arbitrary limitation on field of endeavor.  Might as well have "no girls allowed" licenses.<br/>\n  3. The licenses are rewritten for each jurisdiction, meaning that even once you specify a set of license clauses, you end up having to figure out what that specifically means in your legal jurisdiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ask me, they should have just made a permissive license (the Attribution one), a weak copyleft license (attribution-sharealike), and called it good. If people really want to restrict freedom of commerce, they should hire their own lawyers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sad thing is that the WTFPL is all most people need, even if bowdlerized:<br/>\n<br/>\n  "DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT." is a perfectly acceptable license.  It makes absolutely clear what terms the author releases the work under.  It also avoids misunderstandings about the state of official "public domain" status.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104725/#Comment_104725" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T05:46:16+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  5:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2007 5:47AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Graham:) Are you in favor of no license at all, or a more restrictive license (like traditional copyright)?

Or Attribution-NoDerivatives, which actually is my least favorite license, but which does have it's place for things like previews or free pdf copies of print books, as it allows sharing and distribution but without allowing edits. <br/>(Or like Storn uses a CC license for, basically, advertising.)<br/><br/>The problem comes when people either use the wrong license for what they want to achieve or just use CC-licenses to earn "open license cred" without actually making anything open.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104755/#Comment_104755" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T07:14:43+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  7:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My feeling is that the CC licenses are irrelevant.  If I wanted to use TSOY in something, I would contact Clinton and ask him anyway.  Heck, I've already worked on hacks for Agon, Cold City, and Shock: without first getting permission from John, Malcolm, or Joshua first (though I contacted them about it afterwards).  I would most likely never work on a commercial project where I knew that the original author would not approve of what I was doing.  I have never been attracted to CC material simple because I knew it was CC material and could use it.  If you look at Judd's work on Dictionary of Mu (Sorcerer) and First Quest (TSOY), it doesn't seem like there was that much difference in the licensing, aside from Ron not letting folks reprint Sorcerer's core rules in supplements.  If Judd had made Mu a separate game based on Sorcerer, I don't think that would have mattered.<br/><br/>So, I guess I read CC licenses as simply a flag that indicates an author is interested in having other people make use of their work.  That's all.  Authors could indicate the same thing in conversation or just printing a big "Use My Game, Please!" banner on their website.  CC or not, I would still contact the author about any potential project, since dealing with actual legal stuff is silly (IMO) in small press outfits like this when you can develop personal relationships with everyone involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104760/#Comment_104760" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T07:45:17+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  7:45AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2007 7:46AM by Clinton.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>It took a long time for me to see the light, as I love the idea of Creative Commons, but after really thinking on the subject, I grew to dislike many of the CC licenses.

You have some ideas you thought you might make into a novel someday but they'd fit really nicely into the encyclopedia.  Also, you've noted that there are some pretty cool ideas in the project that you might want to use in your novel.<br/><br/>If the encyclopedia is CC-Noncommercial-Sharealike, you shouldn't take from it for your novel, and you shouldn't give your ideas for your novel into it.  In fact, maybe you shouldn't contribute at all because some of the ideas you have are similar to that and later on the community could harangue you for "stealing" their ideas and not putting your novel out Noncommercial-Sharealike.<br/><br/>If the encyclopedia is CC-Attribution only, you dive right in.  You give and take, the project grows, you get to involve yourself with other creative people, without any later repercussions for your work beyond listing the project in your credits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104772/#Comment_104772" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T08:13:34+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  8:13AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>So, I guess I read CC licenses as simply a flag that indicates an author is interested in having other people make use of their work.

Thus, the "bunch" of GPL licensed stuff grows.<br/><br/>These two positions have not been reconciled in 30 years of computer science, don't expect to do this in this thread <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/>Just recognize it's two different philosophical approaches.<br/><br/>History, so far, has taught one clear lession, though: releasing with BSD-like licenses does not help the makers of the original content, at all. Big vendors take the content, tweak it 10%, close it and resell it, without ever contributing back those changes. The BSD world, even if only rarely and grudgingly admitting it, are now seeing that they would have probably been better off with a more stringent license (like the GPL).<br/><br/>Oh, for the purpose of this model/example: CC-Attribution is BSD-Like, and CC-Attr-ShareAlike is GPL-like.<br/><br/>Non commercial is an anomaly, yes. The GPL like licenses work because they don't restrict the USE at all. Gpl-like "non commercial use" does not make any sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104793/#Comment_104793" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T09:00:02+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  9:00AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>CC-Attribution isn't like that.

That is, nobody can do pretty much anything legally with it, unless you give them explicit permission.<br/><br/>Collaborative projects and licenses: normally it's stated in the project policy that contributing means accepting a license transfer/agreement of some sort. Sometimes it could pay to look at the fine print: it could mean that you automatically transfer the intellectual property to someone else (yes, gleemax, I'm looking at you). More often, you simply agree to license your part of the work with a license that's permissive enough for the whole body of work to be used and released.<br/><br/>But changing the license later on, if it's not a "do whatever you want" license like CC Attribution or BSD, means contacting each and every contributor and asking for agreement, or removing the relevant part.<br/><br/>Public Domain vs CC: Public Domain means close to nothing, expecially outside the USA. CC licenses, otoh, have been written by license expert lawyers, and have been translated and checked to be compliant with the local laws in many languages. For example, I can release a CC licensed doc in italian, but not really set it in the public domain.<br/><br/>CC confusion: yes, it's there, and it's people using the name inappropriately to blame. That's why in the software world we are so picky when license names are wrongly cited. GPL is very different from LGPL, for example.<br/><br/>Stuff "stolen" by the big dogs: yes, it's not that relevant for rpg stuff, but... it is not <i>really</i> that important. I mean, the fact here is that creating new content/rules/games/whatever based on your game does you (and the rest of the community) <b>zero</b> benefit. OTOH, if the new content gets released back, everybody has benefits. The original creator and the community get access to the new stuff. The creator of the new stuff gets the benefit of starting from some really rocking base instead of doing all the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>And I'm not thinking about the CC at all, here. I'm thinking about the OGL. Fate is under the OGL. Spirit of the Century is under the OGL. An SRD is made, and all of a sudden a half dozen derivative projects start, some of them with commercial purposes (Starblazer, Far West, Vegas After Midnight, New Orizons... I probably forget some). And guess what, when they will be under the OGL, and more stuff will be available to Fate players, developers and tinkerers.<br/>The Starblazer's large scale starship, planet and organization rules will be out, available for integration in new games. And the fine guys at Cubicle 7 would not have been able to do so much work starting from scratch such a short time, and it's hard to come up with a new system as good as Fate 3.0, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Bam! Everybody wins.<br/><br/>...IANAL, but I play one on TV :-P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104874/#Comment_104874" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T13:10:01+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  1:10PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason - I didn't say it had no effect, only that it was a blunt instrument. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104882/#Comment_104882" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T14:09:49+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  2:09PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>(Graham:) Are you in favor of no license at all, or a more restrictive license (like traditional copyright)?

It isn't an alternative to copyright anymore than a for-pay license is.<br/><br/>I don't like Creative Commons because it tries to make my decisions for me, and because it attempts to prevent me from entering my own material into the public domain.<br/><br/>Also, I think that software and text-for-reading (which is what we're talking about here: game rules are not subject to copyright) are totally different animals. If I could read the source code for LINUX like a novel, and it had the same stylistic concerns as a novel, it would be better off in a different license. Likewise, if written work (say, I dunno, The Chronicles of Narnia) could be improved by the contributions of millions of hobbyist writers around the world, I would want it in a CC sharealike license.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104890/#Comment_104890" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T15:56:19+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  3:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>I don't like Creative Commons because it tries to make my decisions for me, and because it attempts to prevent me from entering my own material into the public domain.</blockquote>Ehm, care to elaborate on that a bit?

Some are surprising.<br/><br/><strong>If you are distributing or performing the original work:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to include the URI for the CC-Attribution license with each copy of the work you distribute or perform.</li>\n<li>You have to keep, to the extent possible, the same notices about the license as the original author of the work.</li>\n<li>You cannot sublicense the work.</li>\n<li>If the original work is intact in a collection, all of this still applies, but only to that work.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>For collections - this work with others, unchanged - or an adaptation:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to keep the author's copyright notice intact, including the author's name and title of the original work.</li>\n<li>If the author has a preferred URI for the work (like for TSOY, <a href="http://tsoy.crngames.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tsoy.crngames.com</a>), you must incorporate it if technically possible.</li>\n<li>You must, besides the copyright notice, credit the author of the original work <em>in a manner consistent with and no less prominent than any other contributing authors</em>.<br/></li><li>You cannot express endorsement or sponsorship, obviously.</li>\n<li>You also must remove this credit at the request of the original author, if you've made an adaptation.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105130/#Comment_105130" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T10:25:53+00:00" title="October 27, 2007 10:25AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my other life, I'm an attorney in the software world, so I'm somewhat familiar with the nuts and bolts of BSD, GPL, etc.  The analogy with software developers and the various open source licenses is pertinent but inexact.  Many developers are selling services and expertise, such as Apache or Red Hat.  The BSD crowd, by making their license essentially (a) attribute me and (b) please don't sue me, have a better chance of having their software adopted widely by for-profit developers whose clients are chary of the GPL's requirements in the event the technical relationship of the open source software with the commercial code OR derivative changes to the open source component triggers the forced-release of all the code.  When I advise companies, I tell them GPL is safe for use if you keep it partitioned from the commercial code, but it's still risky because governmental clients, for instance, have pretty stringent requirements about inclusion of open source<br/><br/>It's all about creator intent.  If you want your stuff widely adopted so you can leverage your expertise, a less-restrictive license like BSD is better.  If you want to restrict commercial entities from incorporating your work into other products without releasing it as open source, GPL is better.<br/><br/>With creative content and RPG game engines, the comparison breaks down a bit.  There's no ongoing service aspect to leverage--for instance, Clinton probably can't get paid to answer questions about TSoY based on his particular expertise.  Most of this is the smaller scale and lower complexity of the indie RPG market, part is simply the close-knit nature of the RPG gaming community where Q&amp;A happen freely.  The OGL seems to have struck a decent compromise and from the perspective of kicking the market into producing a huge volume of d20 product, it has succeeded admirably.  Whether this flood has helped Wizards' bottom line is another question.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with Creative Commons, but the jurisdictional heterodoxy and patchwork of different licenses would put me off.  If the intent of the authors is to derive income from their games, a standard license that encourages collaboration while preserving some degree of copyright sounds optimal.  If the intent of an author is to have his/her game adopted as widely as possible into secondary products without regard to taking a cut of the sales, a BSD-style license would probably work best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105893/#Comment_105893" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T07:32:40+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  7:32AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I discuss this elsewhere at length but, basically, many of the CC licenses are so nebulously defined as to render them useless for their intended purpose. Many are, specifically, subject to retroactive revision by the issuing party, allowing said party to remove content previously declared as open by virtue of not spelling out very specifcally the terms under which the content was made open in the first place. With the exception of Attribution, the licenses are prone to be fairly disingenuous. Now, granted, I can't recall any CC licenses being abused in this manner, though the possibility is most definitely there. And it shouldn't be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4635/graham-why-do-you-hate-the-creative-commons" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4635/graham-why-do-you-hate-the-creative-commons" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4635/graham-why-do-you-hate-the-creative-commons/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4635%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4635%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
