Note, of course, that this doesn't have to be symmetric:  I can crush on you when you don't even know I exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have one of my heart tokens, you have power over me, for good or for ill.  Obvious, yes?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's where it got a little interesting to me:  I think that a third party should be able to declare, as part of their stakes in a conflict, "If I win this conflict, not only do you <b>not</b> successfully wipe out my spy network, but also I take one of Winona's heart-tokens from you."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same threat <i>cannot</i> be made about your own heart-tokens.  When someone gives you their heart, they make you the custodian of it.  If you go out and live dangerously, you run the risk that <i>they</i> will be the ones to get hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm mildly fascinated to see how and when people trust other people with their heart.  But the thing that's really working me up is the implication that a person who <i>will not risk</i> someone else's heart could find themselves unable to effectively contest for stakes.  They clearly should retain the right to foresake their stakes in order to protect the heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a strange similarity here to <i>Polaris's</i> "But only if" mechanic ... that you could throw out some stakes ("Destroy the spy network") and your opponent could come back with stakes ("Winona's heart") that you're unwilling to put on the table ... so you don't get to even contest for your stakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm pretty sure that I haven't seen that sort of strategy <i>in the process of</i> stakes-setting very much, though.  For the most part, game-texts assume that people will work out a nice happy consensus about which stakes are appropriate and which aren't.  That's suddenly striking me as very odd.  Why is stakes-setting frequently so freeform?  It's the central core of many systems, and yet it's surprisingly unstructured.  Wierd.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65204/#Comment_65204" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T05:09:42+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  5:09AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hiya Tony,<br><br>Dude, when you started talking about giving heart tokens, my brain immediately shot to The Mountain Witch and it's trust tokens.

Let me give a hypothetical example of play:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Jed:  Oh, there is <b>no way</b> that I'm letting Biff show me up.  That little punk has had his comeuppance on the way for a long time, and I'm ready to deliver it with extreme prejudice.  My stakes are that if I win this roll then I utterly humiliate him in front of his friends, destroying any chance that he can ever challenge me again.<br/>\nTom:  Ooookay ... and my stakes are that if I win then you don't get that, and I get to take the heart-token that Sylvie gave you.<br/>\nJed:  <b>URK!</b>  That's not acceptable stakes.<br/>\nTom:  Those are my stakes.  You still want the conflict?<br/>\nJed:  Damn.  DAMN!  No.  Fine.  You win.  Randy seems about ready to rise to Biff's bait, then he sees Sylvie watching from the sidelines.  Instead, he just tucks his hands in his pockets and walks away.<br/>\nTom: "THAT'S RIGHT!" Biff shouts, "You better get while the gettin's good!  There's a new head honcho in town now!"</div>\n</blockquote>\n... thus does conscience make cowards of us all, and like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis dynamic, where you could get jazzed for stakes and then end up choosing to back down without a fight (or, conversely, end up risking Sylvie's heart over a trivial schoolyard scuffle) sounds really interesting in theory, but I worry that it would be immensely frustrating in practice.  I'm looking for insights and inspiration as I go forward to playtesting (hopefully tonight).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65214/#Comment_65214" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T05:42:45+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  5:42AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2007 5:43AM by Eric Provost.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, cool.  So what you're really on about this morning is allowing the tokens to be part of the stakes setting.  In fact, as something that can be demanded as part of the stakes.  I can dig that.  But what I don't dig is all that up-front stakes setting.  I'm just talking about personal preference here, but I really don't care for the break in the flow that heavy handed stakes setting makes for.  I like stuff that's more like...<br><br><i><b>Me:</b>  I humiliate you in front of the entire lunchroom!  *gesturing with dice*<br><b>You:</b>  Fine.  Put Sylvie's love on the table.  If I win, then her love is mine.<br><b>Me:</b>  D'oh!  Nevermind! </br></br></i><br><br>And even better might be...<br><br><i><b>Me:</b>  I humiliate you in front of the entire lunchoom!

There's no way to propose something as being at stake and then take it back without harm (the <i>Polaris </i> "never mind, no conflict" effect). You have to put something irrevocably at risk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65281/#Comment_65281" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T08:55:18+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  8:55AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Which <i>doubly</i> motivates you to avoid having people care about you if you feel that you're going to be getting into bad situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, let me unpack that ....<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving someone's heart makes them vulnerable to you.  And yeah, one reason for taking their heart is because you want them to love you.  That's the Ranma/Ryoga sort of situation, where Ranma backs down some times (though not often enough for his own good) because if he didn't, Akane might come to see Ryoga as a better romantic partner.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut another reason for taking someone's heart is just to <b>crush it</b>.  Because some characters (particularly some NPCs) are <i>bad, bad people</i>.  So, if you are a player who intends to sink down to those people's level, and slug things out with them in a very dirty, painful, ugly, scarring way then you do <b>not</b> want the innocents that you are acting to protect to be placing their trust in you.  If they care for you then that's a great big <b>gaping</b> hole in your armor.  Your enemies are going to aim straight at it, and you're going to have to either get creamed or be the proximate cause of hurting the people you love.  Better to drive them away in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
