<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19400.0" rel="nofollow">Cross-posted</a> from The Forge, Eric Bennet will add his version later.<br/><br/>1.) What is your game about?<br/>Elder/Outer Gods who land on Earth before the rise of Humanity, trying to control and manipulate (proto-)humanity and history to their goals.<br/><br/>2.) What do the characters do?<br/>The characters compete amongsts themselves and against Humanity in order to control and shape it, or fend off the Elder Gods in Humanity's(character) case.<br/>Ultimately, the Gods try to reshape Humanity in their shape, as Servitor Races, whereas Humanity wants to throw off the shackles placed upon them by these External beings.<br/><br/>3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?<br/>The players play the Elder Gods, one of them plays Mr. H. They compete against one another over the limited Resource called Humanity and its future. They work out deals and backstab one another to further their goals, while being careful to not be overthrown by the strengthening(?) Humanity. Mr. H. fills in the GM's role, and portrays the Gods' effect on Humanity and Humanity and the world's reactions.<br/><br/>4.) How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?<br/>The setting is initially that of one lone star hurtling through space, with "something" crashing on top of it, simultanously creating life and its rack. As time progresses the setting expands as culture and humanity progress, or do not, based on the Gods' goals.<br/>Humanity being a finite resource with a defined growth-rate leads to a boardgame mentality, with "wildcard" events acting as randomizers to keep people on edge.<br/><br/>5.) How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?<br/>Character generation includes answering questions about what your God is, what it wants, what it wants from Humanity, how these relate to one another and so forth. This is the Function phase. This is done by drawing from a limited number of words to create the answers to these questions. Since the words will be mutually exclusive one can be ensured to have a character that will have a hard time to work with others, if at all.<br/>The characters' goals may also stand in stark opposition with their methods. Nothing like a ravenous entity that wants to breed lower beings.<br/>Character generation will also have a Form phase, where you pick and choose different physical/spiritual aspects of your character, which give you certain weaknesses to be covered, and powers to exploit others' weaknesses. Or relate differently to Humanity.<br/><br/>6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?<br/>Backstabbing and alliances, being able to plan for the long term while being able to respond to a quickly changing playing field.<br/><br/>7.) How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?<br/>Those who cannot form alliances, uphold them, backstab others and protect themselves from being backstabbed will find their strategical position deteriorating as they are picked upon by the other players. Mr. H's player is more there to portray what happens than form any interaction with the players, their relationship is that of cause and effect.<br/>You need to be able to make and execute long-term plans that will be carried over several rounds of play-time in order to reach your goals and secure victory.<br/>As you are not the only player present and other players as well as random chance are likely to throw monkey-wrenches at your character you will need to be able to think on your feet and redraw plans. <br/><br/>8.) How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?<br/>Turns progress with Mr. H. narrating the overall results of the past turn and setting the new scene, or epoch, as each round of play is another notch on the progress of time. What the world does, what humanity does, etc. The players then describe their actions, with Narration being traded based on system and Mr. H.<br/><br/>9.) What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation? (i.e. What does the game do to make them care?)<br/>You can win in this game. Everyone wants to win, or at least everyone participating in this game should want to win. Narration rights can be bought and move around quickly.<br/>You make and break pacts with other players and constantly look out for number one. You.<br/><br/>10.) What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?<br/>The Resolution mechanic of the game is based on that of <a href="http://craniumrats.pbwiki.com" rel="nofollow">Cranium Rats</a>, albeit modified. You roll D6 and need to roll under a trait ranging 1-5, based in large on your Form and Function, those who compete in an action roll to see who will control the conflict, with those that rule highest on single dice gaining Narration.<br/>There are Dice and Token as different resources that can be used to bolster rolls, stop others and so on.<br/>How the mechanics will be modified from those of CR is not yet final, but there will certainly be advantages to controlling more of Humanity, having your people more advanced, more loyal, etc. Humans can die, be stolen and they can rebel. Resource management will be inserted and controlled by Mr. H., Humanity will be able to perform on a wider scale, but not as strongly, thus making several small "characters". As Humanity's numbers increase it becomes more dominant, harder to control and more likely to rebel. Probably done by having a limited number of pools and inverse relationships.<br/>IE: Number+Loyalty=20. Number=10&gt;Loyalty=10. Number=15&gt;Loyalty=5.<br/><br/>11.) How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?<br/>On the Gods' front they relate to how each Elder God tries to shape History and make his vision become reality through the narration. On Humanity's end it's a resource game that will tend to lead towards Humanity breaking free and an end-game where they fight the Elder Gods for freedom or slavery, forever.<br/>If the Elder Gods try to keep humanity down they will have a much harder time to gain their goals, and it will happen much slower, giving the other Elder Gods more time to thwart their plans.<br/><br/>12.) Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?<br/>Humanity advances based on its reactions to Random Events and the machinations of the Elder Gods. It also advances based on its natural progression chart provided it is not messed with.<br/>Elder Gods gain resources in a manner based on their Function, their Form may shift as they gain or lose conflicts. Their Function may change completely when challenged or proven ineffectual to the point of crush.<br/><br/>13.) How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?<br/>There's a limited pool to draw from, so characters are forced to compete in order to advance.<br/>Humanity is messed with in order for the EG to advance, so it competes against them.<br/>Competition is encouraged and reinforced through advancement. In fact, there is no advancement without reinforcement of the game's premise!<br/><br/>14.) What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?<br/>An urge to squelch opposition, to sit down and consider both the tactical and the strategic consequences of their actions, while trying to factor in what others do.<br/><br/>15.) What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?<br/>The setting. Well, H.P. has such a cool premise going on, and so many people like it, they and he must be onto something.<br/>Well, to be frank, most of the difference between this and CR is the premise, and the premise is setting based. The rest of the mechanical shift from CR is there merely to support this unique premise, so it must be explored.<br/>I want to explore the cold-lone space, I want to explore the inhuman and inhumane Elder Gods.<br/>This game is about Control, but also about Freedom.<br/>Eventually, it's about Victory.<br/><br/>16.) Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in? Why?<br/>The option to have a limited game-play length and how the Resource you're vying for? That's basically another player's character!<br/>Why? Because I feel this game may form a strong bridge between RPGs and Board-games, and could be modified with ease to be more of an RPG or more of a board-game, depending on what the group desires at the time.<br/><br/>17.) Where does your game take the players that other games canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, or wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t?<br/>At the other player's throats.<br/>It lets people play a God. Just like in Black and White, you play a god-sim. You can play that in other games, sure. But not in other RPGs. Yours is the power to take control of humanity, of your people, and shape them according to your vision.<br/>Your very distorted vision.                </div>

                            18.) What are your publishing goals for your game?<br/>Publish as PDF, later as Book, joint effort with Mr. Bennett. Will be tied into <a href="http://craniumrats.pbwiki.com" rel="nofollow">Cranium Rats</a> from which it had sprung.<br/>Currently undecided if to publish/promote as a short limited-time game ala The Mountain Witch or a more medium limited-time game ala Polaris.<br/><br/>19.) Who is your target audience?<br/>People who like H.P. Lovecraft's works, people who like board-games. People who like God Simulation computer games.                        </div>
