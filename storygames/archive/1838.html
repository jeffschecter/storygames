                    Hello Everyone,<br/><br/>So, I went to GenCon SoCal briefly on Friday night and all day Saturday.  While I was there I got to observe part of a Spirit of the Century game; character creation on Friday night and then part of actual play on Saturday.  Now what I'm about to say is going to come off as very harsh cricticsm of Spirit of the Century so I have to be clear up front.  I have not read Spirit of the Century and I have not actually played it myself.  My comments are strictly based on what I saw happening at that table and even then I was doing one or two other things (like reading Wilderness of Mirrors).<br/><br/>Here's what I think I saw.  I saw a character generation system/session that rapidly generated a lot of pulp flavored color and got everyone grooving on each other's character's look and feel.  This is not a bad thing.  This is, in fact, the best thing I saw and after watching this I had high hopes that Spirit of the Century might actually be a game that interests me.<br/><br/>Then I saw the actual play.  And it seemed to me that the game kind of walked out the door.  What I saw was a bunch of great personalities creatively riffing of each other's color that was generated during the character generation process.  I saw a lot of creative use of key catch phrases.  I saw laughing and smiling.  I'm not denying anyone's fun here.  But what I didn't see was a game.  I saw a bunch of people talking and then (without much structure at all) sort of employing an overly complex version of a coin flip to occassionaly decide whether something should go left or go right.  Not once did I see any tension, decision making or cross-table player engagement happen over the deployment of the resolution mechanic.  All the fun here was because people were doing something I call Engaging The Players Around The Game.<br/><br/>Contrast this with something like Dogs in the Vineyard.  A player puts forward a Raise and attached to that Raise is a bit of fiction.  Right away there are decisions to be made.  Since you know the value of the Raise you know how much "weight" your bit of fiction is going to carry.  If you push up a whopping 16 you know it's going to be powerful.  What do you want to carry that kind of power?  Some witty dialogue?  A gunshot?  It's important.  The other players recognize its importance.<br/><br/>Then across the table there are more decisions that must be made in return.  At the game level: How do I beat a 16?  At the character level: What traits do I want to apply and how?  At the story level: Are the stakes really worth escalating to the next level of violence?  And probably most importantly at the inter-play communication level: What do I want my See and bit of fiction to say about their Raise and bit of fiction.<br/><br/>I call this Engaging The Player Through The Game.  Everything that the players are meant to connect over is rooted in decisions proposed by and mittegated through the game itself.<br/><br/>Now I would like to say, I saw a potential mechanic in Spirit of the Century that MIGHT be used to the ends I'm talking about.  It's the rule that I think is called Compelling An Aspect.  (Again I haven't read the game so this is coming from observing the game).  So my understanding is that the GM can offer up a resource called a Fate Chip to get your character to do something specific.  If you want to refuse you have to pay a Fate Chip.  This is how I WANT this mechanic to be used:<br/><br/>Let's say I'm playing a detective (Jack Bloodthorn) with the Aspect "There's always a Dame..."  Bloodthorn is walking up to the house of a key witness when he hears gunshots inside.  Then there's a scream and he sees a woman (not the witness) being driven off in the back of a car speeding out of the front drive.  The GM offers up a Fate Chip and says he wants Bloodthorn to chase after the woman 'cause, "There's always a Dame!"<br/><br/>See what I'm facing now?  Part of this is the get a chip/pay a chip decision but I'm also being asked what the safety of the witness is worth vs the safety of the unknown woman.  The offering of the Chip is an underscore or exclamation mark around the decision.  It signals to everyone at the table, "Hey this is important!"  The Aspect demonstrates WHY it's important.  And my decision to take a chip or spend a chip demonstrates just HOW important it is.  Engagement THROUGH the system.<br/><br/>My problem was that I didn't really see this potential use of that system deployed and I didn't see much of the rest of the system organized around its use in the manner i describe.  Note: For all know this was never the intended use of the mechanic anyway so criticising it for failing to be central is not really the point.<br/><br/>This is turning rantish and I don't mean it to be.  My point is that red flags go up for me when it seems like all the fun is centered around just appreciating everyone's witty commentary and personality.  I can do that without a game.  If I'm playing a game then I want to connect and socialize and have fun with/through/about the game.<br/><br/>Does this make any sense?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>

Engagement THROUGH the system.</em><br/><br/>I wasn't there for the Saturday game but the Sunday spill-over GMed by Ryan Macklin, though I made my character that Friday night with everyone else (I had another event that Saturday night, alas).  Not knowing exactly how it went down Saturday, I can say with a modicum of authority that what you "wanted" to happen actually did on Sunday.  <br/><br/>To make with the examples, I played Gwennie Godfrey: crack photo journalist and Centurian adventurer.  One of my key Aspects was "My trusty camera", and as we landed on the island of Baron von Robot, it became <em>quickly</em> apparently that EVERYTHING was made of clockwork.  Everything.  The birds, the trees, even the grass.  It was here that I may have fallen a little bit in love with Ryan (excepting, of course, that I kind of already was.  But I digress).<br/><br/>I, as a player, mentioned that I probably felt compelled to snap some photos.  Ryan upped the ante by suggesting I not only grab some pictures, but that I lag behind to do so, separating Gwennie from the group.  Now everyone knows you shouldn't go off wandering by yourself, ESPECIALLY seasoned adventurers.  I visibly hemmed over this decision, and as I was about to decline the Fate chip (and having to pay him one instead), Ryan went and offered TWO chips (pulling on my Aspects "Anything for the truth" and "I left him at the alter", which during CGen had been identified AS Baron von Robot) if Gwennie would fall behind and isolate herself.  Delema!  I would now have to pay two chips to not separate my character.  What was more important: sticking with the group and the safety in numbers, or reveling in the pathos of "what I had done!" to drive Jim Robot to his Baroning Clockwork Ways.<br/><br/>This happened several times over the course of play (to which I note that Alejandro's dice were ON FIRE; he seemed to only role 4 +s or 4 -s, it was surreal).  We also had several Aspects added to the scenes themselves we could play off of/use to modify our own roles.  Albert A's smashing of port over the Robot Ninjas to create "Sticky Works" comes to mind.<br/><br/>Again, not having been there at the Saturday game, I'm not entirely sure what you saw.  But from what you describe you wanted from SotC and what I played on Sunday sound to be about the same thing.  But mileage always various, of course.                        </div>

                            The SotC rules strongly encourage the GM to "compel" aspects. Players can compel their <i>own</i> aspects, begging the GM to complicate their character's life for some Fate Chips. I think players can even compel <i>other</i> players aspects, but I'm a little unclear on how that works.                        </div>

                            In my game at the weekend I only managed to get one single compel into the game that rocked. That wasn't because of the system missing the mechanics to do so, but because of the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>The game was played light and fast as a demo of what Spirit of the Century is, and how it works.</li>
<li>The players played their characters to the hilt already, so I didn't <i>need</i> to compel their aspects. I probably should have given out more Fate Points as is, or explain the self-compel mechanism better.</li>
<li>I was first considering the sheer number of Fate Points in the game to be too high, but in retrospect, it just means I didn't offer the players enough opportunity to tag aspects of NPCs or scenes.</li>
<li>There was no interparty conflict that I managed on a level like a dogs conflict. The one rocking compel was during character-to-character interaction, though ("honest guy" trying not to tell a good friend that's secretly in love with him (he doesn't know that) he visited Pemberton U to meet his secret love).</li>
<li>I simply forgot about the mechanics two out of three times. I managed to cash in a lot of fate points, though</li>
</ul>
In conclusion, with a bit more SotC experience under the belt as a GM, I think this would have flown the way Jesse wants.<br/><br/>Coming back to the original question: SotC goes a long way to take the stuff 'around the game' into the game mechanics wise by aspect use. I don't know about Ryan or the game he ran, but my suspicion is that he needed to ease into the system a bit before it got rolling just like Laura described above. Meaning I want to run and play more of SotC, and your 'rantish' commentary helped me see where I can improve as a GM and player when doing so.                        </div>

Chris: In SotC, everything might have an Aspect: NPCs, scenes, props. There are different ways to add, declare or discover these aspects, which you can then 'tag' to your advantage. Of course, this mechanism applies to interparty conflicts as well. Adding/Declaring/Discovering Aspects and tagging them is a vital part of the conflict system, as it proactively allows you as a player to considerably improve your chances of success. Under certain circumstances, tagging an aspect introduced into the game like this costs you a fate point, which goes to the character whose aspect is tagged (in other words, it's a reverse compel).<br/><br/>And while I am on a rules tangent: Conceding is about as important for the conflict system as giving is in Dogs. When you discover that your father is the piece's villain, that should be more than enough to concede, even if you have the upper hand mechanically. Same holds true for the GM - When I discover the villains greatest fear is showing his face to people, forcing him to do so should lead into a concession, having the Evil Engineer of Electricity flee from the scene before he can put the final lock onto his death trap or whatever.                        </div>

                            Jesse, <br/><br/>I think this "around" vs "through" distinction could be useful to me. For more reasons than one. <br/><br/>However, at this point I feel compelled to add to what everyone else said not a direct defense of Spirit, but a general impression of quick run games and one-shots with folks new to the system. In a game in which there is high "around the game cool" like Spirit and a system that is either a) not always obvious in the way it impacts play, b) impacts play over a longer term, or c) is being run with a scenario that isn't fully maximized to show off the "through" part of the game -- you will often end up with a situation much like what people are describing here. <br/><br/>I've seen it with Burning Wheel, I've seen it with TSOY, I've seen it even with Dogs with a whole group who were new to the game. By the second or third game there was lots of "through" engagement (and no little around engagement), but that often took time to come about.                        </div>

                            Definitely the fact that it's a con game contributes much more to the experience of play than anything else, including the actual choice of game and any contribution the designer makes. D&amp;D at a con is more like DitV at a con than it is like D&amp;D in an ongoing group. This shouldn't be a big surprise since the social level overawes everything you try to do in games.                        </div>

                            The point about it being a con game is a good one, and I shouldn't overlook it. That said, I think that Jesse hit on something here that I've been worried about with the latest incarnation of the FATE engine. I've even been toying with starting my fantasy game back up with it. But there's something niggling at the back of my mind about it.<br/>
<br/>
I think that Harald's experience here is key. I know Harald, he was in my FATE game previously. And I know that he amongst all people in the world, understands the system as well as anybody does. Yeah, sure he's getting used to the new version of the game, that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
But will he ever get used to it? Shouldn't it be accessible the first time out?<br/>
<br/>
Here's the thing that I find with SOTC, on hearing about it (note that in disclosure I haven't even read the game, much less played it). The system works well, apparently, when the currency system is being employed heavily back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
But it's never required to use the currency system.<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong about this. And certainly there are places where the text says that at certain points that a particular sort of Aspect should be tagged. But these seem all like recommendations. The basic resolution system is in no way inextricably linked to the currency system. And that means that it lies on top, and that if players are, as Jesse says, engaged around the game, that they probably will avoid using this system.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I largely did when I played FATE.<br/>
<br/>
There's this sense that for certain players that they're "advanced enough" in how they play that the FATE Point rules seem ancillary. Like Harald says, they're "already" playing their characters to the hilt. So why do they need mechanical incentive to do so? And, if that doesn't happen, where do he FP come from? If that doesn't happen, then the designers admit that the currency system doesn't fly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really want to be wrong about this. And there's a good chance it's true. So can somebody who's read the game please tell me why I'm wrong, and precisely where the game does make the use of the currency system an automatic part of play? Such that I'm forced, if playing FATE, to be dragged into what the system provides?<br/>
<br/>
Or is the game just not for lazy folks like myself who are non-self-starters as far as this stuff goes?<br/>

                            Mike, <br><br>I've actually wondered about SotC in just that mode myself. <br><br>However, I saw it as being a feature rather than a bug. Those who want to use it will, those who don't like that sort of heavy structure on their play won't. I can see where it could be an armadillo in the middle of the road issue, but I'm more inclined to see flexibility as a strength of the game. <br><br>However, even there, there are ways in which some use of the currency mechanics starts to become manditory if you are heavily investing in the mechanics as your system. Even though SotC characters are competent they will fail at tasks, and the desire to increase chances of success should lead to spending of points to use Aspects, at which point the currency starts to flow from the natural expedient of players wanting to succede. After that if the GM doesn't start compelling aspects, or players don't start compelling their own in order to get points back, the currency system is going to clunk and people are going to notice. It isn't exactly fail fast, but there is a similar "if you aren't moving the currency around the table you'll quickly start to notice the lack" economy that isn't dissimilar to PTA. <br><br>Of course, this is all based on my one short online game of Spirit, so I too could easily be wrong.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Albert - I got SotC this week and the same relation to thematic bateries occured to me.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thor</cite>Engaging the game can be very off putting for some.</blockquote>
I had one of my players in a FLFS game this last weekend say just about the same exact thing -- he described himself as a "very experienced LARPer" and said that the system requiring him to play his character in certain ways was uncomfortable, and that he already played up his character himself.  I couldn't argue much with the position: it sounded very similar to the freeformer disliking games that provide too much structure -- it interferes with what they've already got going on.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br><br>I recently ran into this problem while helping a friend playtest a game. He very much wanted to help people come up with cool descriptions of things in the moment of game, and so was working on a mechanized system to generate cool descriptive color. (As a hack for Exalted stunts, btw.) <br><br>He had me try it out, and it was fucking painful. It was like giving a BMX stunt-rider a BMX with training wheels and one of the friction wheels they use to keep speed down and asking them if it helped them do stunts more easily. OTOH, another person I know loved the system, because stunts were always the part of Exalted she hated the most.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah, pretty much exactly.  And I can appreciate both sides of the "problem."<br><br>I think there's a middle ground, though.  There's a difference between mechanical guidance and support that helps you do a thing that you can do without that support, and then mechanical guidance and support that has you do a thing in a specific way that's appropriate to the specific game.  Dogs falls pretty neatly in this second category, to my mind.                        </br></br></div>

                            Wow, this discussion has really taken off in ways I didn't expect.  With regards to the specifics of Spirit of the Century, I'm glad that others read and employ the mechanic that caught my attention in the same way that I read it.  Although, I agree with Mike's assessment in that it seems too easy to by pass.<br/><br/>With regards to the larger topic this totally is a System Does Matter issue.  In terms of design lately I'm just really grooving on identifying where the mechanical decisions and the character/story decisions meet and the cycle which makes that worth repeating over many iterations.<br/><br/>Games which do that seem to more often then not avoid many of the things I dislike about roleplaying.  But my main point was about illustrating that I definitely see two extremely different activities going on here.  One engages through the system the other engages around the system.  One I find fun the other I find anoying.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

I find games in which either direction is crossed over the other, assumes that one can fill the role of the other, or just doesn't know what its doing annoying.<br/><br/>Best of all are probably games where you have some degree of both reinforcing each other.

                            Damned if I hadn't forgotten the interaction model. I didn't give this version a read through, but I recall it's a cogent piece of work, and this looks even better than before.<br/>
<br/>
Part of my problem, as I see it from Brand's description of the game is that it's fueled primarily by the player's desire to have the character win. I don't have that desire, nor do most of my players (at least not in spades), so I think that's why the system doesn't get off the ground for me.<br/>

                            Yeah, Mike.  Which is where a lot of games kind of go unhitched for me.  When you spend resources to increase character chances of success, and that's the only use for your resources, it means that I can't spend resources to decrease character chances of success when that's what I, as a player, would like to see.  It's my biggest problem with <em>PTA</em>: stakes are what the characters want, and fan mail is spent for promoting character interests.  ( Note, however, that said problem isn't very big, and I'll be playing <em>PTA</em> tomorrow night. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  I like to see games give players resources that <em>can</em> be used to support character efforts, but can also be used to do other things, including kneecapping characters.                        </div>

                            Mike, <br><br>Ayup. <br><br>Josh, <br/><br/>So, in the interaction model, it occurs to me that games that get players excited around the game act as good "fuel for the pump" -- but that they don't always have enough to get the machine running. Games that get you through play, otoh, keep it running, but may never get you excited enough to start it. <br/><br/>Which leads me to thinking about systems that start the interactions fast and hard before play starts by using "around" techniques, and then follows up with "through" techniques to keep that initial high going. <br/><br/>I have no idea how to do that yet, but I think it may be doable.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Joshua, it occurs to me that SotC/FATE fulfills your criteria IF you put the dice turning option (rather than a straight +2 or a reroll, you can change the face shown on one of your 4 dice when you spend a fate point) from FATE 2 back in. It works even better if you let anybody do a compel instead of just the GM or just when tagging.                        </div>

Modifying slightly, though, I'm sure there are games that are procedurally sound enough to operate consistently but those very procedures are not in and of themselves incredibly entertaining.  However, in such a situation, I think the players' Goals would be constantly revised downward, so that they expect less and less as the game goes on, until <em>somebody</em> decides to speak up and say that they're not content with so little entertainment (or more likely, the "next session" never seems to be able to get scheduled).<br/><br/>Game designs can start things off fast and hard and then draw that initial player interest into the gears, recycling player engagement back around, yes.  This is a good design strategy, and <em>Dogs</em> is a good example, whether you consider Accomplishments as that first fast and hard or riding into a town that's, say, on fire.  Even after the fire is put out, the system has already sunk its teeth into the characters and the players will want to investigate further -- that initial interest is circulating around the table.                        </div>

                            I have a suspicion regarding Fate 3.0 and the tendency to forget about the fate point issue:<br/><br/>There are three different flavors of resolution: Simple rolls against fixed numbers (checks), complex rolls on both sides (contests), and chained complex rolls (conflicts). It's easy to only use the first two kinds of flavors and gloss over the third. For example, I had all the players roll once  to determine if they fall under the roaches' influence. This should have been a conflict where a number of wins in a row are very important because of the roll-up feature on the damage track. You really want to hit high marks repeatedly to force your opponent to concede, which you'll probably achieve by using your own or tagging your opposition's aspects.<br/><br/>I'd need another session or two to find if this suspicion holds true, but if there is a conflict or two for each character to participate in, aspect tagging/compelling is much more part of the system than with the single roll resolution flavors.<br/><br/>The things that SotC needs (and lacks IIRC) is advice on building a potent conflict mechanics wise, i.e. NPCs that hold up against a group of characters, and how to use the rules strategically as a GM. I'd like to see the authors answer this thread - is it OK if I put a link to the fate mailing list?<br/><br/>EDIT: It seems I am clinging to SotC as an instance for the problem that's to be discussed in this thread. Should I break out into my own thread?                        </div>

                            The issue of "What do you do if a player is already so engaged in his character that you don't _need_ to compel him?" is one that came up a lot in discussion of Fate 2.0.  Now, I'll admit it's the kind of problem I don't really mind having, but it was definitely a genuine issue, so we gave it some bandwidth in SOTC, and have a section about "accidental" compels.<br/><br/>See, the rub is, if the compel reward is for simply playing your aspects well, then it's just an RP award.  Now, that's fine to a point - I admit to being fast and loose with FP when players do something cool, make us all laugh and so on - but that's not really the intent.  An FP is rewarded when a meaningful choice is made with options curtailed by the aspect.  Given that narrow a descriptor, the GM has much clearer guidelines for when they can reward a player for one of these self compels.<br/><br/>That said, one other idea that has come up in conversation is that with the opening up of the handling of aspects, it would be entirely possibel to drop a bowl of FP in the middle of the table, and make compels (and rewards) everyone's business.  Haven't tried it yet, but I suspect it would work very well fro a group used to similar economies.<br/><br/>One other thing to note, in transition from Fate 2.0 to SOTC - there are more aspects in the universe now, and their interaction with play is definately much more tightly tied into things.  While you could play without ever takign a compel off yoru character sheet (which, heck, you could also do by taking entirely 'positive' aspects and having a kind GM) you would be hard pressed to never take a compel at all, be it form your environment or an aspect that someone else _put_ on you. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyway, I do want to say thank you to many people in the thread for clarifying that aspects really can do what the OP was looking for.  Much appreciated.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Of course the "self-compel" is something that Rob, Fred and I have discussed intensively before in the FATE mailing list. Or, rather, as Rob clarifies, the question of when to give such a reward, that basically being when we all feel the tension regarding some decision that revolves about an Aspect.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to hear that there's something in SOTC about that. And, yeah, I think that's lots better than simple "role-playing rewards." I find in practice in trying to modify the system by which I give out HP in Hero Quest, for instance, to be like a Fan Mail system that it simply doesn't get used. HP have great output uses, but the input is, currently, mostly just a vague refresh method.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I've also tried to do the input as some sort of "Goal" mechanic - which would be similar to rewarding for "accidental compels." But players have complained about that, too. Interesting since this is very precisely what TSOY does in a very explicit way, to much accolades.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm not even sure this would make it work for my play either (I say my play, and not "our" play, because I get the feeling that me being GM has an inordinate effect on how my players play).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for taking compels off the character sheet, I think that might work. But, again, that's something we tried in the Shimmering Sea game, and I don't recall it getting used even once. Which surprised the heck out of me.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the issue is that it's simply a "cueing problem." That is, in many games where such the use is optional, if there's no cue in the rules as to when to use the mechanics, the players simply forget to use them (even if it's to their benefit to do so, or they'll get rewarded for doing so). In HQ, using Hero Points to bump can only be done at one point in the process. But even then I've found that their use drops off if I don't explicitly say every time "That's a Marginal Defeat, bump to a Minor Victory?"<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if one remembered to verbally cue players in FATE when coming up with the total modifiers... I'll have to think about it. Making it a standard part of the process, like I do with augments in HQ (you don't have to augment, but it's clear in my games that it's an exception not to have any augments). Rob, do you and Fred verbally cue? Or do you just find players reaching for such?<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking something like: "What is your skill rating in Fists, and what Aspects are you bringing into play?" Is there a general term for activating an Aspect in any of the myriad ways that they can currently be activated by the players?<br/>
<br/>
Again, the problem is, in part, because the uses are optional. In D&amp;D combat, you roll for initiative, you roll to hit, you roll for damage. Where options exist, they're questions of whether to use spells or something. Unlike Aspects where you have to consider whether or not the Aspect makes sense in the case in question a spell's effect is known, and there's no judgment to be made (other than whether the situation merits it's use). When you have mechanics that are instituted completely at the option of the player, especially where he may be uncertain if they're applicable, in play I've seen players just skip these steps. Sans a will to push for a win, and a willingness to play out the Aspect wether they get a bonus for it or not, why bother doing the extra math?<br/>

                            Mike, <br><br>I've seen the cueing problem too, and it mildly confuses me everytime it happens. What do you think is behind it? Is it just that most players really aren't so deeply interacting with the rules and so don't remember options, or is it that they're used to dealing with the rules in a straightforward way and so the "odd bump" doesn't fit into their mental diagram of how play goes, or what?                        </br></br></div>

I think it's just extra work for no percieved benefit. If they can opt out, they will.<br/>
<br/>
Note that it could well be that the engine in question would be great if fired up and used. But, as above, if it doesn't get going, people aren't going to see that.<br/>
<br/>
Which makes me feel that, perhaps, it may be the simplest solution to get off your butt as GM, and make it happen for the first few times until it's flying on it's own. I just wish that the system had a way to do it, itself.<br/>

                            Wow.  If only this topic had mentioned Spirit of the Century in the subject line -- I would have taken notice of it much sooner!<br><br>Here's my opinionated, personal take on things:<br><br>* If you have a scene in Spirit of the Century, and exit it, without having interacted with aspects in some way, that scene was either totally superfluous or you've missed something.  If on analysis it proves to be superfluous, why in hell did you have the scene?  If you've missed something, it may be because you didn't zero in on the opportunities to invoke, tag, declare, assess, or compel.  Very often the GM has missed an opportunity to regard a player's behavior as compel-reward-worthy.  Shame on him.<br><br>* When the original poster says "What I saw was a bunch of great personalities creatively riffing of each other's color that was generated during the character generation process. I saw a lot of creative use of key catch phrases. I saw laughing and smiling. I'm not denying anyone's fun here. But what I didn't see was a game," he is professing that he is blind, but wondering why he didn't see something.  Or to put it another way: <b>"creative use of key catch phrases" IS THE SYSTEM IN OPERATION.</b> <br><br>* Let's look at this from the perspective of a TSOY game where I have, say, the Key of Masochism (I'm looking to get hurt in fights for XP).  If an outside observer watches me get into fights a lot and get fucked up, while I silently mark down some XP for what I've done, that observer might easily conclude that there's nothing but an "overly complex coin-flip" involved in my behavior.  But he's flat wrong.  I'm not going to engage in that path of behavior without having that particular Key under my belt.  Its presence created incentives for behavior.  That's system.  That is in fact, engaging me THROUGH the game.  Aspects work in a nearly-identical manner -- but when characters have just been created, it's hard for the GM (who's the gatekeeper on players receiving rewards for that -- some more thoughts on this shortly) to stay on top of what everyone's aspects are.  Which flows into...<br><br>* The players have a RESPONSIBILITY to say to the GM "hey, look, I acted in accordance with this aspect, it restricted my choices interestingly and dramatically, I should get a fate point".  But that responsibility isn't always communicated to the players, nor acted upon.  Let's look at TSOY again, since I have a recent experience playing in Jason Morningstar's TSOY game at MACE.  Jason said up front to us that we should be driving hard at our keys, and self-regulating whether or not we're due XP for certain actions.  Worked fine, especially for a Con game.  I did my various Key of Doom and so forth actions and got XP for it that I was responsible for recording, personally.  So here's where I alter what I was saying earlier: while the text suggests that the GM is the gatekeeper of Fate Point rewards for compels, there's no reason -- especially in a con game of SOTC -- for the GM to reserve that role solely for himself.  He should feel free to delegate to the players -- to tell them, hey, if you have a scene where your aspect makes trouble for you, grab a fate point from the bowl in the center, don't ask me about it.  You should be gaining and spending FP in every scene if possible!<br><br>That said:<br><br>* If I ever say in the game, you are having bad wrong fun if you are bypassing the Fate Point economy, I should stop making Fate games, because I've just become a dick.  Fate is founded on a philosophy of "use what you like, set aside what you don't".  We don't exercise the "tyrrany" of EVERY PART OF OUR PRECIOUS PRECIOUS SYSTEM MATTERS AND MUST BE USED on purpose.  As a Fudge-based game, that's an ethos that is preexistent in that community, and as such we're aggressive about encouraging drift, customization, mix-and-match use of what we put out there.  We don't enforce a damn thing, and we shouldn't; the attitude suffuses every edition and version of Fate we've done for the past five years.  <br><br>* And given that, it's fucking hilarious to me that the empowered players of the indie movement go nuts when confronted with a game that says you don't use all of it all the time in every way provided.  I mean, come on, guys.  Really?  <i>Some games are do-whatever-you-want friendly, and aren't worth engaging in a great hue and cry over when one group has the fun without using every intricate detail of the system.</i>  Cope, already.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hey Fred,<br><br>I already noted in my original thread that I thought I might be picking on Spirit of the Century unfairly.  And a couple of other posters have already noted that the game can really sing if you have the Fate Chip economy working in full force.  It just happened to be the game at hand that really clearified this idea of around vs. through the system for me.  I can think of half a dozen other games where I've seen the same results.<br><br/>I would like to clearify that the "creative use of key catch phrases" I was refering to was not in the context of a structured conflict within the fiction or driving motivation for a character.  It was simply in a kibitzing, wink-wink, nudge nudge manner.  Now, if the goal of the Fate System is simply to get you to repeat your Aspect phrases as many times as possible in a jokey fashion, okay, but I want to give it more credit than that.<br/><br/>And for all I know there were many moments like that and I just missed them because I was also doing other things at the time.  So, again, I applogize for picking on Spirit of the Century, I was just using the glimpses of the game that I DID see to illustrate a larger point about RPG design that's important to me.<br/><br/>If it helps, by contrast I think Don't Rest Your Head is a work of genious.  I mean that sincerely.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></br></div>

                            Jesse,<br/><br/>Ok, so I'm a little late to the party, but since I was the GM for the session in question, I want to throw my two cents worth in. I similarly felt that while there was great use of color in the game, there wasn't the hardcore awesomeness as I would have liked. I blame myself for that, not SotC, and here's why.<br/><br/>1) I wasn't as familiar with the system as I should have been. I was sure I could run a fun pulp game, but I wasn't sure if the game I ran was going to be Spirit of the Century. As a result, I spent too much time trying to get the rules right and not enough time latching onto people's aspects to compel them.<br/><br/>2) As a result of (1), I ran people through a scenario I'd run several times before. I figured if I wasn't completely comfortable with the rules yet, I might as well be familiar with the rough outline of action. As a result, there weren't strong thematic hooks for the players to hang their aspects on. This confirms my long-standing hypothesis that if you're going to have a pre-arranged scenario, you need to have pre-generated characters. On a related note, I've run a lot of highly structured (read: railroady) pulp games in the past, and my first attempt to break out of that mold didn't go so well.<br/><br/>3) Frankly, I was just off my game. It's been a while since I've run a pickup game, and I just wasn't at the top of my form. I've gotten used to long-term play, and I had a hard time switching back.<br/><br/>So, I agree with you, Jesse, about what you did and didn't see at the table. What you didn't see wasn't there not because the game doesn't have it but because I didn't bring it.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say I didn't have fun. The players were rockin', and I fed off that energy. I really liked what I did see of Spirit of the Century, and I'm jonesing to play it again.<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>

Fair enough.  But behind the jokeyness is, I think, something valid: the phrases (aspects) are goal-posts for the players to drive at.  Sometimes that'll just come out in at-the-table conversation, and it's easy to think that when it does, it isn't an effect (or at least side-effect) of the system... but I tend to believe that it is.<br/><br/>As to your broader point, I entirely get it, vis a vis engaging players through the system vs. around it, but I do think that without being directly involved in play it's easy to see something that's "through" and label it as "around".  In fairness, you suggest that that may have been what was going on, so no worries there.<br/><br/>Paul's comments shed further light, though I would bet cash money that he's being (as I would be, too) more critical of himself than his players would be.<br/><br/>To take the focus off Paul in specific, though, I believe the "problems" encountered are fairly typical early-encounter-with-new-system turbulence.  By the third session at the latest, the vast majority of SOTC GMs should be much more on the ball, if only because they'll have had a chance to read and digest the aspects on the PCs' sheets and start taking actions that directly address those ideas.                        </div>

                            Hear, hear, iago. If I use a game as written, it's because I don't really care about it enough to rip it apart.                        </div>
