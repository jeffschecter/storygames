"I've never heard of any of these games!" I think it would be a great idea if some indie game veterans committed to running some games for newbies on Saturday at Go Play NW. I know people will do this anyway, but I'd like to get it rolling now.<br/><br/>If you're going to GO Play Northwest, and you want to run a newbie-friendly session, please go to the <a href="http://goplaynw.wetpaint.com/page/Indie+Games+101" rel="nofollow">Indie Games 101 page</a> and sign up. After we've got a few people, I'll send an email to everyone on the Go Play Northwest list and see if we can get some bites.<br/><br/>Also, feel free to share your tips for introducing people to Story Games here. I'm going to run a session, and I've never really done one for beginners before.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75786/#Comment_75786" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T23:49:47+00:00" title="June 14, 2007 11:49PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My tip is: don't compare the game to other games, especially not to "traditional" games.

Guide with a firm hand and expect everyone to play the game you're there to play.<br/><br/>Just like you would when introducing someone to Scrabble or Blue Moon City or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75796/#Comment_75796" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T04:36:17+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  4:36AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2007 4:38AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What John said.  I think saying it's perfect for people who play X is a little creepy.  X is perfect for people who play X.  In terms of easing discomfort, you'd be way better off making sure everybody knew everybody else as a person.<br/><br/>As far as running TSoY or whatever for people who have never played an RPG, that's cake - I promise.  People really used to other systems will need a lot more help, but just being clear about procedures and (importantly) explaining why they are cool is all you need.  They are there to play, they will work with you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75989/#Comment_75989" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T13:58:23+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  1:58PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Introduce yourself and let everyone else make eye contact, shake hands, say their names, make some small talk, etc. This seems obvious, but it can get lost in the shuffle of excitement if you're not careful.

I cna't think of any off-hand, but that's more because my brain is fried with now getting ready for a game than it is because none exists.  And if it's fun enough, you can walk someone through it.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh, I'll suggest Burning Wheel as not newbie-friendly, but only as non-newbie friendly as some of the ore traditional games, like D&amp;D or GURPS (from my experience).<br/><br/>But I digress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76044/#Comment_76044" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T21:43:57+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  9:43PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, it seems to me that I've run tons of games that aren't newbie friendly.
