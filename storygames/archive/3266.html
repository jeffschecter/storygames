Who actually does it is totally up in the air.<br/><br/>I've encountered a lot of folks who treat Game Master as a social <em>identity:</em> it's something that somebody <em>is</em>, and the group recognizes that person according to that label, be it GM or DM or what-have you.  Other members of the group will refer to them and say, "Jim's our DM."<br/><br/>Now, part of it can be the conflation between host/organizer and GM, sure, but it seems to go deeper than that.<br/><br/>Have you ever said, to yourself or to others, "I am a Game Master" rather than "I am the Game Master for this game?"  Why?<br/>Alternately, have you ever identified someone else in your group (and there's another assumption right there) as the group's GM?  Why?<br/>What goes into taking on GM as an identity, or assigning GM as an identity, rather than as a temporary role?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74118/#Comment_74118" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T17:52:16+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  5:52PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, outside of the indie scene, most RPGs are long-term affairs.

In long-term games, the roles really establish themselves.  I ran a Shadowrun game for three years, and everyone referred to me as "the GM" when talking about the game.<br/><br/>With my group now we are friends AND gamers.  Out and about, we don't call each other "player" and "GM", but on more than one occasion I have been introduced to a friend of theirs as "Hey, this is my friend Nathanael, he's my GM" and such - and I've done the same with them as "a player in my game."  I guess gaming makes that big of an impact on our personal cohesion, that it becomes part of who we are as both friends and gamers with each other.<br/><br/>What about you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74126/#Comment_74126" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T18:40:20+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  6:40PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Additionally, I've known many gamers that would <i>only</i> GM, and many that would <i>only</i> play.

Some of them make it positive to be a GM, others negative. <br/><br/>For example,many "GMs" get a lot of self-value out of being able to run a good game. (It ties in with how a lot of folks get self-value from being able to design games. You are not a game designer, you are a guy that designs games, right?) Hell, for a lot of games running a good one isn't easy and being able to make it work evenly is something to be proud of. Get used to it, and the pride that comes with it, and its an easy slide to make in order to bring it to the level of "this is what I am, I am this skillful thing." <br/><br/>Now, that's something, and the GM reinforcing that to keep their role is the obvious outcome. However, it goes deeper than that, as a lot of players reinforce the "you're the GM because you're so excellent at it!" thing because it means they don't have to do it, and get to keep the GM running games for them while they do nothing. They like being "the peons" because while it might suck sometimes, they also don't have to do the work and (if they have the right agendas) can still reap the rewards. <br/><br/>So both sides have something to get out of it, and something to get trapped into by it. <br/><br/>Bastard players. Sneaky monkeys, all of them. That's why I am a GM. <br/><br/>P.S. I also sometimes say "I'm a GM." But when I say it I am saying "I am the guy that usually ends up GMing because everyone else is a big coward baby, oh, and I actually like GMing most of the time, so I don't really mind, because it helps me get the kind of fun I want and I'm good at leadership roles to help others get what they want too." But saying "Yea, I'm usually the GM" or even "Yea, I'm a GM" is easier than rolling all that out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74136/#Comment_74136" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T19:01:50+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  7:01PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand's PS is everything I was going to say.<br/><br/>If you have any questions about "being the GM", ask me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74138/#Comment_74138" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T19:13:57+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  7:13PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Brand.<br/><br/>And I should have said, "You are not <i>just</i> a GM.

Not my role within gaming, but how I have constructed my understanding of myself. It says that I am a facilitator of creative energies, that I work hard to create synergy in the creative energies around me, that I have a vision that I want to bring to others (and bring hard), and that I am willing to push hard against my friends because I know antagonism is important to a good story.<br/><br/>I am not saying these are tools that I employ while GMing. Yes they are, but... I am saying that these are things which GMing helps inform my identity on.<br/><br/>I've recently considered exploring Vancouver's kink scene, and am a little hesitant... but at the same time I try to validate the curiousity with parts of my identity that already exist. One of which is "you do roleplaying, blah blah blah", but another of which is "you're a GM, so you're connected to antagonism and power dynamics within social situations, blah blah blah".<br/><br/>I very much allow the fact that I am often a GM inform parts of who I am, and I let other parts of who I am inform how I GM.<br/><br/>I think that's perfectly healthy, and I like to own the fact that I am (often) the GM.

I've belonged to at least two dozen groups since college, playing everything from PTA to Hero.  All the long-running groups rotated GMs like tires, and the role of the host and the GM was never conflated.  The GM was simply the person who, by consensus, was the GM at the time.  The host was whomever had the best rec room or the most accommodating family or who was agoraphobic (not kidding!) or whatever.  <br/><br/>I really had no idea that this was not the usual configuration.  No wonder Shreyas is trying to start a revolution.\n<blockquote>What goes into taking on GM as an identity, or assigning GM as an identity, rather than as a temporary role?</blockquote>\nSudden realization! -- when I think about the one-off groups I've played in, the groups that came together to do a single limited-run game and then disbanded -- those games had more of a "Jeff's Deadlands" or "Matt's Hegemony" vibe to them, where the groups were very strongly identified with their gamemaster.  But since those gamemasters were part of the larger cloud of gamers and were not exclusively gamemasters, this identity didn't persist.  It was temporary.<br/><br/>The longer-running, more formal groups, like UGX or SGA -- those had a recognizable group identity and weren't dominated by a single game master, so no one in those groups could reasonably claim the gamemaster mantle all for themselves.<br/><br/>( Someone should write up an interesting post that asks penetrating questions about game group identity.  Knights of the Dinner Table gets excellent story-mileage out of this kinda stuff. Game groups in that comic are equal parts religious sect and street gang, and this depiction doesn't strike me as false, just a bit exaggerated. )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74171/#Comment_74171" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T03:57:52+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  3:57AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group also plays at the home of the people who have the best house for roleplaying in.

Since RPGs are my pacifier for theater (no time to attend all the rehearsals of plays as a grownup), running dramatic and entertaining games is an important outlet for my creativity.  When I have a campaign die, I feel responsible.  When the players don't have fun, I try to figure out how I fix it.<br/><br/>In the past I've heard gamers state, "Everyone at my table GMs" and it makes complete sense to me.  It instantly tells me that each member of the group has been "behind the screen"; they know the work involved, the multi-tasking and negotiation needed to make the game sing.  It tells me that the table would more likely see cooperation and coordination, less turtling, less orphaned bada$$ PCs, more open-ended backgrounds, all that good stuff you crave from players.  That doesn't make it true, but it paints a picture for me.<br/><br/>Did I wander off topic?

One of my favorite games I play in my head when meeting new people is to wait to see how long before they say, "So what do you do?"  Usually, it happens either right after you share some innocuous conversation and need to transition to another topic to avoid "stand and drool" time.  Before I met a local gamer recently who never once asked me the question, the record was about a minute and a half.  Its such a common way for us to understand people by what they do.
