It's based on ideas we talked about in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15530&amp;page=1#Item_68" rel="nofollow">this</a> thread. <br/><br/>F, X, O and myself were playing. We played upstairs in my house; I have a small "office"/den, with my daughters' bedroom next to it. We used the office as an off-game planning space, and the bedroom as play space.<br/><br/><b>Prep</b><br/><br/>I laid out the principles and ideas. The game is run by an attitude; listening, challenging, seeing the real people, things like that. It's collaborative. The central idea is that you use whatever techniques you see fit, whenever you feel they're appropriate. We've got some thirty suggested techniques in the document, but obviously there are hundreds of techniques in roleplaying. <br/><br/>We didn't want to plan much (as, indeed, you shouldn't in this game/framework); basically, after a few minutes of talking, we sent two players into the play area, gave them each a name, and F told them to whisper so they wouldn't wake the child. (Whispering is one of the suggested techniques).<br/><br/>In this <b>first scene</b>, X and O established that there was something weird going on. Their characters - Paul and Judy - had been paid by someone, the Master. They were waiting for something to happen, but obviously things weren't going right. They got on the phone with the Master, and we sent F in to play him. I believe this scene ended with Judy sitting on the floor, crying; as she was about to stop, I said "stay with it", and it went on beyond uncomfortable, into something else. We play physically, as a matter of course.<br/><br/>After the first scene was over, we sat down and talked briefly. (The rhythm of action - reflection - action is central to the method). I suggested we didn't work too hard on making more plot - let's just go with what was established and build on that.<br/><br/><b>Next scene:</b> One of the Master's henchmen, talking to a friend over coffee. I played the henchman; suddenly one of the others told me to do a monologue (another suggested technique), which I did. At this point, a lot was established about the Master - enough, in fact, that we ended up not needing to portray him any more for the rest of the game, although we didn't know that yet.<br/><br/>As usual with my memory, things become a blur. But we played at least these scenes:<br/><br/><b>The nightmare. </b>Judy earlier talked about a fat woman stuck in an elevator; here, X played that woman, while F and O were the elevator walls. They pushed her physically, lifted her off the ground. I described babies being pushed out of her. Then we cut to Paul, dreaming about killing babies - pretty grisly stuff; remember this was in a childrens' bedroom, and we had baby dolls for props. <br/><br/><b>The hunters.</b> Four people are waiting to kill the couple; they haven't heard from them for a week, and the new baby must be just right. One of the players tells me to do a monologue, about how I'm a traitor. After that, we argue, and they kill me. I describe, as I lie on the floor, how I'm dissolving.<br/><br/><b>On the plane.</b> Paul (played by F) and Judy (played by me) are on their way to Barcelona. We're incredibly tense, under so much pressure. F narrates in character how my face is dissolving on one side. We fight. I scream (startling the other players), and F/Paul screams back. The stewardess, played by X, is appalled.<br/><br/><b>On the beach</b>. Paul and Judy have escaped. We switch players (as we do several times during the game); here, I think F plays Judy, while O plays Paul. X wanted to try the technique "Metaphors become real", so we start by brainstorming some metaphors. Raining cats and dogs, "this is just like paradise", "like a fish in water" etc. It all gets very surreal, as Paul and Judy grow gills, enter the garden of Eden, are bombarded with cats and dogs that run off chasing each other... but wake up, exhausted, in their hotel room.<br/><br/><b>The Bedtime Story.</b> Probably my favourite; Judy is five, and her dad is telling her a story. I interrupt and tell him to narrate something completely wrong and inappropriate. He goes into a story about one tribe performing genocide on another; X, playing little Judy, talks about how all the elephants trampled the little babies. It's obviously a story she loves. She asks: "Am I going to die, daddy?" O answers, standing up: "Not us, sweetheart. We follow the stars."<br/><br/><b>The Gift.</b> Judy is going through her metamorphosis, which is painful and scary. Paul is with her, being his usual evasive and weak self. I tell the player to become the anti-Paul, and he turns confident, egotistical, insensitive. Then I tell Judy's player that she can give this metamorphosis to him, if she wishes - but they have to lock eyes (a technique), and she has to explain it in character. She does, and he accepts it as a gift of power, not understanding the pain until it hits him.<br/><br/><b>Paul's Death.</b>Later, Paul is dying from the metamorphosis in a mountain cave. Judy finds him, sits by him as he dies.<br/><br/>We had several more scenes; I don't recall them right now. But after a while, it started to feel like we needed an ending. I suggested we do three different ones, directed by the three other players (I know I took charge of the procedures more than I'd intended, so I tried to make sure I didn't take too much charge of direction). <br/><br/><b>The last scene</b> had me as the aging Judy. Paul was dead; F was my new lover; O was my daughter. Judy was by the pool, her lover bringing her a drink. They talked, and Judy went silent and remote - then started talking about that cute childhood story. To her daughter: "Do you remember? I used to make those little squishy noises when the baby heads were crushed like eggs - squishy, squishy". The daughter is appalled, and obviously has felt alienated for years. She almost throws a pillow - then another player tells the player (O) to do it for real, and he does. I fall off my chair, get back on it like an old lady, then unfold my body to show the metamorphised, powerful, non-human real Judy. I tell the daughter that she will be the same when she grows up, it's already in her. Then I fold up and am the harmless old lady by the pool again.<br/><br/>F directed the <b>epilogue</b>. It was simple: The daughter, sitting alone, in silence, while we imagined the end credits rolling over the screen. F told O (the player) to sit for a long time, which he did; and this is maybe the image I remember the best from the game, him/her sitting there while the music played.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366009/#Comment_366009" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T11:36:55+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 11:36AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So. As you can see, we used a lot of different techniques. Play flowed from one scene to the next, with little planning and hardly any long-term planning. I don't know about the others, but I definitely brought myself into it; my fears, my experiences - as a spouse, a father, a son, a human. <br/><br/>It is a framework that is very simple and intuitive - if you have someone there to facilitate it. We're working on making the text better, because we think that right now it's not entirely clear how to play just from the document. Also, there are a lot of assumptions and nuances that most probably are lost, or that we haven't written down.<br/><br/>However, I think that we're on to something. Or, rather, I know we are; this is getting to something I've always envisioned or wanted from role-playing. I think this is, quite simply, what I want to do with the form right now. It feels obvious, somehow.<br/><br/>I hope it continues to feel right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366202/#Comment_366202" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T06:58:26+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  6:58AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!
