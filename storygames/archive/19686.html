But there's help to be had before then, in the form of a play-by-email synopsis workshop that runs from august 23. to 26. There, you will have a chance to exchange ideas about your synopses, inspiring and being inspired, and you will get invaluable constructive criticism for your synopsis.<br/><br/>What are we talking about here? Fastaval 2015, in Denmark, april 1.-5. See also <a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/?lang=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fastaval.dk/?lang=en</a><br/><br/>What is required for you to submit a synopsis to Fastaval? We want you to want to write a game for Fastaval, and we want you to intend to do your best to be there should your game be selected, or to at least send someone to speak for your game. In return you will get all the game writing support that Fastaval can muster, and the chance for one of the most exciting opportunities a roleplaying game writer can get: To take part, as a game writer, in the great celebration of excellence and serious fun in roleplaying games that is Fastaval. It is worth noting that Fastaval accepts only original games. You can have tested elsewhere, and you can modify an existing game, but the experience that you offer Fastaval goers should be substantially different from what has been played before, elsewhere.<br/><br/>If you're interested in taking part, please email us at scenarieansvarlig@gmail.com by august 21., so we have a chance to organize it.<br/><br/>By way of preparation, you should produce a brief pitch for use in the workshop and have some idea of how your game will work in play. Also, it's a good idea to read up on this: <a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/synopses-what-are-they-good-for/?lang=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fastaval.dk/synopses-what-are-they-good-for/?lang=en</a><br/><br/>A formal call for synopses will be coming out soon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437848/#Comment_437848" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-27T13:05:22+00:00" title="August 27, 2014  1:05PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And it's here, with all of eleven days to go: Call for synopses for Fastaval.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/knowhow/scenario-writers-corner/?lang=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fastaval.dk/knowhow/scenario-writers-corner/?lang=en</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
