Another rpg tackling history is <b>Making History</b>, which offers not one but three games with two set in the past. The games are short and concise, which I find interesting. I\u2019m as well interested in <b>Mud, Blood, &amp; Glory</b>, which is a game set in the Wild West, with seemingly more traditional mechanics, which I got starred too.<br/>Another game that I got starred is <b>Afterlife</b>. Taking on the role of dead people trying to find out who they were in a surreal adventure sounds interesting. I do think that the approach of <b>Facing the Titan</b> which focus on the cost of the fight against Titans more than the tactic is interesting to. As is the <b>Orpheus Protocol</b> which offers a more traditional Urban Fantasy setting. Then there\u2019s the <b>Advanced: Pandemonium</b> with a dystopian ScyFy fantasy Setting and the rather simple and fun <b>S3RPG</b> game. If you like science fiction you can look forward to the <b>Traveller Fifth Edition</b>, if you are more into Cyberpunk have a look at <b>GeneFunk 2090</b> or if you\u2019re more into SyFy take alook at <b>Flotz</b>. Fantasy enthusiast on the other hand can select from <b>Five Torches Deep</b>, <b>Dimensions</b>, <b>Far Away Land</b> and <b>Escape from Orodor</b>.<br/>There are many more interesting project, like the Patreon of <b>Eric Franklin</b> for the Kicksnarker community, the <b>Kingmaker</b> project by Paizo on the GameOnTabletop platform, the <b>Leather D20 Dice Bag Kit</b> offering a do-it-yourself project for creating dice bags, a <b>Dice Charger</b> for lumicent dice, the <b>LumaCast</b> to literally luminate area of effects and many, many more:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>5 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 \u201eHistory\u201c Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Science Fiction &amp; Cyberpunk Role-Playing Games<br/>7 Supplements<br/>1 Supplement Material<br/>2 Adventures<br/>5 D&amp;D Adventures<br/>2 Dice Projects<br/>5 Accessoires<br/>2 Stickers &amp; Badges<br/>2 Soundscapes<br/>1 Comic<br/>4 Digital &amp; Electronic Stuff<br/>3 Map-Tile Projects<br/>4 Various RPG Projects<br/>5 Other Games<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Theater Project<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Adventure<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Supplement<br/>2 Series &amp; Documentations<br/>1 (RPG) Rum<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/05/12/crowdfunding-collection-106/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/05/12/crowdfunding-collection-106/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484421/#Comment_484421" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T14:36:55+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  2:36PM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/05/27/crowdfunding-collection-107/" rel="nofollow"><b>Crowdfunding Collection no. 107, including every tabletop project started between 05/12 and 05/27.</b></a><br/><br/>After a small break and the fantastic Larp experience Club Babylon Schwarz, I had a small delay, yet present to you the collection in full.<br/><br/>Among the German projects you can see that <b>ICONs RPG Assemble Edition</b> and <b>Savage Worlds Abenteuer Edition</b> are receiving a translation if funded. Next to those the pre-order for <b>Malmsturm \u2013 L\xe4nder des Sturms</b> is started, it isn\u2019t exactly a crowdfunding, yet imho as a original Fate setting and game it deserves a shoutout.<br/>There are plenty English games as well. Like <b>Dark Trails</b>, which caught my eyes because of the cool sugar skull thumbnail design and essentially promises Deadlands with a DCC ruleset. <b>\u201aTWAS -The RPG before Christmas</b> is a game based on the game book by the same game book. It does offer a rules light system and aims to enable players to delve into legends and fairy tales. Then there\u2019s <b>Gate Watch</b>, a small, card-based, GM-less game in which players explore what lays behind the titular gate.<br/>I am backing <b>Dust Wardens</b>, which is a Powered by the Apocalypse game, which explores queere communities on a road trip during the post-apocalypse. The fact that its offered in zine form makes it rather inexpensive. Then there\u2019s <b>Hearts of Wulin</b> a PbtA games that offers Wuxia action. Then there is <b>Harsh Generations</b> which explores a fallen America with a mix of PbtA and Fate mechanics.<br/>Among the Fantasy games I would like to highlight <b>Pirates of Pugmire</b> by Onyx Path. It offers cool pirate setting with dogs, and cats, and birds exploring the high seas. Then there\u2019s the red box of <b>Dungeons &amp; Delvers</b> offering classical and <b>Heola: The Starborn</b> offering low fantasy. If you like your fantasy to be dark &amp; metal you might rather \u2013 or in addition \u2013 have a look at <b>M\xd6RK BORG</b>, <b>DEATHROLL</b> or <b>Sideralia</b>.<br/>Next to those there are SF games, like <b>Zoetrope</b>. Zoetropes offers time traveling adventures that are fun, card based and rules-light. If you like to explore the edges of known space you might give the OSR, Black Hack game <b>Golgotha</b> a go. While if you are into retrofuture Cyberpunk and fitting 90s anime you should check out <b>Hard Wired Island</b>. Last but not least <b>Vintage Space</b> promises optimistics disco-era SciFi.<br/>There are of course plenty more interesting, engaging, cool projects. A gamebook named <b>Twisty Little Passages</b>, exciting settings like <b>Ultramodern</b> for D&amp;D 5E, dice projects like the nifty <b>Dice of the Giants</b> or the eatable <b>Sweet Rolls</b>, there are <b>Gamer Pens</b>, a <b>Sunset to Sunrise</b> Larp set in the World of Darkness and many, many more projects!
