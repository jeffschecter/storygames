But then something<br/>clicked.<br/><br/>That was when you took a long walk down the streets of the Mad City,<br/>stopped being a Sleeper, and started being Awake. But that click you<br/>heard wasn't from the secret world snapping into place. It was the<br/>sound of the Nightmares flicking off the safety and pointing a gun at<br/>your head."</span><br/><br/>- from Don't Rest Your Head, by Evil Hat Productions<br/><br/><br/>Hi everyone, this is cross-posted with <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/indie-netgaming/" rel="nofollow">indie-netgaming</a>. We have two players and a GM for a <em>DRYH</em> PBP soon to start, and we're looking for one or two more players. You can find more here:<br/><br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/32a5bf" rel="nofollow">The interest thread at RPG Crossroads</a><br/><br/><a href="http://samaritan1975.proboards20.com/index.cgi?board=dryh" rel="nofollow">The game's forum at RPG Crossroads</a><br/><br/>The other players have their characters and it's looking pretty cool!<br/><br/>If you haven't played DRYH before I think you'll be able to pick it up.
