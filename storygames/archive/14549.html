Games.</a>  It's about the last, desperate survivors of an alien invasion that took out 99.9% of the adult population of the world.  These teenage soldiers are fighting a final and desperate guerrilla war against these alien nightmares, using reverse engineered alien technology that literally uses love (and hate, and trust) as a weapon.  Specifically, as a big honking robot, Robotech style.<br/><br/>It's a visual novel, specifically a dating sim and turn-based roleplaying game: think fully illustrated Choose Your Own Adventure books with voice-acting.  The combat sections are... pretty much the tabletop game with additional movement and special attack rules (you get special attacks at Intimacy 5 and maybe passives at Int 3), which we're back-porting to the Tabletop Game.  The Interludes are pretty much the Interlude rules as written in the main book.<br/><br/>And we've also got sweet art from a woman of some notereity, Buttercup Sayian, who I have the luck to call my lover - this is her take on Sara Smith.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i472.photobucket.com/albums/rr82/BlissAuthority/sara_hires.png"/><br/><br/>I hereby declare this the Ask Your Questions About This Game Thread!  Does anyone have any questions or comments about the visual novel that they'd like to ask me?  Stuff about the rules, the story, even the process of writing it or Kickstarting it are welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331448/#Comment_331448" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T06:44:22+00:00" title="June 24, 2011  6:44AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the date of completion that you're shooting for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331451/#Comment_331451" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T06:58:05+00:00" title="June 24, 2011  6:58AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2011 6:58AM by Emily_Care.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great project!

Consider yourselves credited beta testers.  Final build should be about a year from August, hopefully coinciding with the in-game Bliss Day - August 10, 2012.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>Great project!  How does it look when you're in the dreaming with your robot?</blockquote>\nMost of the time, like an artist's impression of the area, in colors suitable to the season and general psychometric 'flavor' of the local Dream.  Warzones are fiery red, places of death and destruction are ashen, places full of joy are a riot of color.<br/><br/>Our biggest inspiration for the look of the Dream in-game is <a href="http://www.braid-game.com/" rel="nofollow">Braid</a> by Johnathan Blow.  In particular, the bombed-out areas of San Francisco look a lot like the very first scene of Braid - with a slightly glowing red haze in the background from all of the fire and blood.<br/><br/>As a minor side note, a bit of head-canon that crept into the game is that the Resistance calls the physical world "The Wake" in a bit of gallows humor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
