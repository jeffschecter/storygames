One of our recurring special events is <a href="http://www.hammercon.ca/speedgaming" rel="nofollow">Speed Gaming</a>, which in brief is like Speed Dating but with games. I was running Monsterhearts, and my setup worked so well I've decided to share the material and approach I used in case someone else would like to try it.<br/><br/>In 25 minutes per group of 3-5 players, I wanted to explain what the game was about, present five options for Skins, teach the basic mechanics of Moves, Strings, and Conditions, go through Backstories, then generate and play out a short situation. I ran through six groups like that back-to-back.<br/><br/>The players picked from the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9eoxi8krmnl6qqr/monsterhearts_characters.pdf" rel="nofollow">character sheets provided</a> (Infernal, Mortal, Queen, Vampire, Witch, slightly modified to fit on a single-sided sheet). We ran through stat assignments, then Backstories. If/when we hit backstory points that referenced unclear things (like the Infernal's dark power or the Queen's gang), we talked about what that meant. We briefly talked about (player) Moves ("say what you do, I say what happens, unless what you do triggers a Move, in which case we roll dice and let the Move determine the outcome") and Strings. This was also referenced on the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qwn75ygawmrnarv/monsterhearts_moves.pdf" rel="nofollow">player cheat sheet</a>. We didn't go through the Moves in detail, so in play I had to prod a little ("that sounds like you're Manipulating an NPC to do what you want, or maybe you were Turning Him On to get leverage over him?")<br/><br/>Then I presented the situation: you're all 17, you're in high school, and you're all at this rowdy house party together. It was either the Jock Kid's parents' house in the 'burbs and the kid was getting antsy, and there were rumours that the police were about to be called; or it was the Eccentric Goth Kid's parents' old mansion on the outskirts of town, and while things are starting to get crazy, the kid oddly didn't seem to care at all; or it was the Rich Kid's parents' upscale loft condo packed with people thumping with loud dubstep dance music. House parties work great as kick-offs in Monsterhearts.<br/><br/>Then, I referenced some questions I'd written down on my own cheat sheet: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tkr2bvx3ejfxkkk/monsterhearts_mc.pdf" rel="nofollow">MC cheat sheet</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Cain the Infernal: Who is your Dark Power? How do they manifest, if at all, in the physical world? Who has your dark master told you to bring him? Why has he said he wants him/her?</li>\n<li>Robin the Mortal: How did your lover hurt you, and why won't you forgive him/her? What will you do to hurt them?</li>\n<li>Brittany the Queen: Who are you currently involved in a business relationship with? What deal are you trying to make? Why are you concerned?</li>\n<li>Marcell the Vampire: Who are you on the prowl for? How do they know that you are? How have they avoided being trapped by you so far?</li>\n<li>Abrielle the Witch: Who do you suspect is lying to you, and about what? How will you find out?</li>\n</ul>\nThe questions were written to work with the characters' pre-selected Moves, hexes, etc. All "who" questions referred to another PC. Instantly, this generated pretty strong motivations for the characters and set up a motivation web they could play with for the remaining 15-or-so minutes.<br/><br/>In play, I didn't make up any NPCs. If the players referred to NPCs I had them name them, and I played them super straight, to the point, and reactive - plotting was for the players to do, and always against each other. There were no Threats.<br/><br/>It was intense and fun. I encourage you to try it.<br/><br/>Things I left out from covering was Highlighting and Experience/Advancement, Sex Moves, Darkest Selves, and (for obvious reasons) Growing Up Moves. We didn't end up using Conditions a lot either.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>Speed Gaming works like this:<br/><br/>We dedicate a time slot, or a fraction of a time slot, depending on how many games we have. This year we had three hours. Then we count up how many games we have on offer and how many players we have, and divide them evenly between the games. Our aim is 4-5 players per game. We then divide the time slot available by the number of games/groupse. This year that worked out to 25 minutes / game.<br/>Each group sits down with each game teacher, who is typically the designer of the game (we recruit designers first, and then fill empty spots with fan volunteers, such as myself for Monsterhearts). Stop watch starts and the game begins. We try for 5 minutes of teaching mechanics and 20 minutes of play time. For simpler games, that's no problem. For more complex games, sometimes rules have to be cut out or modified slightly, and/or game situations have to be set up in advance to get to the good stuff quickly (e.g. pre-stacked decks / hands for card games, board setups for board games, pre-gens and in media res for RPGs). If the game doesn't support the full number of players (4-5) then the players are grouped so they make decisions together.<br/>At the 22 minute mark we give a warning so the teachers can wrap things up to satisfying conclusions, then we rotate, and start again.<br/>Everyone who participates in the full slot and tries all games get entered into a draw for prizes, typically copies of the games on offer.<br/>A slightly tongue-in-cheek description of the event can be found here: <a href="http://hammercon.ca/speedgaming" rel="nofollow">http://hammercon.ca/speedgaming</a><br/><br/>What we adore about this event is that people who are really into one kind of game, e.g. CCGs or RPGs, are kind of "forced" to try out other types of games, often games with really unique mechanics. If they really hate it (which I don't think has ever happened), it's just a few minutes of their lives anyhow - not 4 hours of precious convention time lost. We love broadening people's horizons.<br/><br/>It's also awesome for the designers / teachers, as it lets them work on their pitch and teaching methodology! We've even heard reports of designers reconsidering the rules for their prototype game, because they found themselves constantly glossing over certain rules due to time constraints, and eventually realizing that rule was overly complex and unnecessary anyhow.<br/><br/>What was particularly awesome about the event this year is that we ran it 10am - 1pm on Saturday morning, which gave people an instant energy boost and served as an ice breaker for the rest of the convention. People got to know each others' names and got exposed to many of the games that would be running in longer slots later on. We're super happy with it!<br/><br/>We talk a bit more about it here: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/113002138553898786336/posts/LUxr25QJiAJ" rel="nofollow">https://plus.google.com/u/0/113002138553898786336/posts/LUxr25QJiAJ</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396412/#Comment_396412" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T12:51:59+00:00" title="November  5, 2012 12:51PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic!<br/><br/>Great write-up, thanks for sharing.

Putting an even greater emphasis on that and giving them only one Skin move on an index card would work even better, good idea!<br/><br/>I purposely left out the Sex Moves for this demo, because there was no time for having the talk about consent and IWNAY and X-cards and whatnot... and in a highly public hall, with the player base about 50/50 predominantly board- and card-gamers, I wanted to tone down the sexual content and dial up the teen drama. Having said that, in one case two characters ended up sloshing in a hot tub together 5 minutes into the game, and I mentioned that in the full game, that'd have triggered a Sex Move mechanic - much to the players' amusement and awe. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396443/#Comment_396443" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T14:27:48+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  2:27PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like this structural setup.
