Basically you grab a bunch of d6 and throw them down. 1-6 represent room types and what is in each room is determine by looking at the faces of the dice that are touching. So your possible combinations (21 total) are:<br/><br/>1-1<br/>1-2<br/>1-3<br/>1-4<br/>1-5<br/>1-6<br/>2-2<br/>2-3<br/>.... <br/>6-6<br/><br/>So what I am wondering is how to the odds work out here? I'd like to make sure that some things that show up in rooms only rarely and others more common. <br/><br/>And does it mess things up instead I use dice of different colors to represent different room types like:<br/>White     Red<br/>1            1<br/>2            2<br/>3            3<br/>4            4<br/>5            5<br/>6            6<br/><br/>and so on.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>ara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333758/#Comment_333758" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T13:45:42+00:00" title="July 10, 2011  1:45PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is basically <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14450&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">the d66 that we discussed here not too long ago</a>.<br/><br/>If the order of the die matters (32 is different than 23), then you get 36 possible results, each of which is equally likely as any other.  If the order doesn't matter, then you get 21 possible results, and double results (11, 22, 33, etc.) are twice as likely as any other.  (The post is inconsistent about whether ordering matters or not.)<br/><br/>The only other weird part is the "no dueling int he kitchen" described in the blog post.  That's simple enough: each die only has a number once, so 5 can't be the top number (determining room type) and also the side number (determining wall or entrance).  So events with a 5 are less common in that area (if order doesn't matter) or events starting with 5 are impossible (if order does matter).<br/><br/>Note that on standard dice, opposite sides add up to 7, so category 2 is less common in 5 rooms, as well.  And the layout of numbers will be relevant for determining results.  Weird dice, low quality dice and Chinese style d6s with the big 1 pip will give some odd results.<br/><br/>A careful design might be able to design around the opposite sides adding up to 7, to make corridors that go in straight lines for several rooms.  If both category 3 and 4 are open corridors, then you'd see hallways that stretch for several squares at a time.<br/><br/><br/>If you're using two colors, you'd have to decide how the two colors interact.  You could have white/white and red/red be the same, while white/red and red/white are a separate category, giving two possible lists of connections.  Or you could have three: red/red, red/white and white/white (in this case, red/white is twice as common as all one color assuming equal quantities of both).  Or possibly even four, if red/white and white/red are different.  <br/><br/>Strategic use of color distribution could also be used: there's no reason you need equal quantities of red and white dice.  Maybe only a few rooms are red and most are white.  Maybe a single black die is the villain's central lair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333785/#Comment_333785" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T17:24:42+00:00" title="July 10, 2011  5:24PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool. Thanks for your explanation. I was trying to wrap my head around this and failing. I am putting together something like three colors of dice white, blue, green, and then two special ones with the black and red die. I may have some more questions as I dive into this. <br/><br/>I like the idea of corridors. I am going to play around with three sets of dice colors the 3s,4s being corridors. <br/><br/>Thanks for d66 link. I think I missed that earlier. <br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
