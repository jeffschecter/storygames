It took us a while to get comfortable with doing it.<br/><br/>The key for me was having at least some information to play off of so that my Spout Lore felt like I was expanding on what was there rather than making something up whole cloth. For example, the cultists we were fighting had been kidnapping people and showed obvious signs of large snake-bite wounds on their arms. So I spouted lore that the cultists of the snake god used drugs and poisons to cloud the minds of people to make new recruits. That may or may not have been what Adam intended all along, but it <i>felt</i> right, as opposed to some of the earlier times we'd rolled it when it felt like we were just groping around for something to add to the situation.<br/><br/>If I was playing an ongoing game, I don't think I would tend to use it as much as I do read a person/sitch in AW, but maybe that would change as I got even more comfortable with it. I like player authorship in games a lot, but I still feel some oddness about this particular implementation of it that I can't quite put my finger on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334218/#Comment_334218" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T10:34:14+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 10:34AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Spout Lore and Discern realities are the two most important moves in the game, so naturally I have some opinions here. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The core of traditional old-school is that the players ask questions and the GM gives answers, typically starting with \u201cI open the door, what\u2019s in the room?\u201d This conversation is what establishes the fiction and sets the expectations for what the PCs can or cannot accomplish, and how difficult it will be to accomplish. Eero has written eloquently elsewhere, for example, about how we establish what the threat is within a situation and how we go about figuring out the risks involved in resolving that threat. DW shines in providing a set of moves that drive and focus this conversation. Spout and Discern are the core of this. All the other moves do this too in several different ways as well.<br/><br/>The form of the conversation in ODD and in Spout/Discern is PCs ask and DM answers, but of course this isn't the only way we converse. Players also suggest things and the DM responds. Often the suggestion is in the form of a question like "is there something in this room I could wedge the door with?" or "how much do I know about what carrion crawlers eat?" Sometimes it\u2019s bigger like \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool if Vecna was behind this!\u201d or \u201cwhere can I find a +5 Holy Sword?\u201d<br/><br/>The stuff that\u2019s not covered by \u201cwhat\u2019s in this room\u201d is pretty important. If, for example, a player has an interesting vision of their PC as the latest in a long but disgraced family line, it's extremely useful for the DM to know that. However, if it doesn't come up in the form of the back and forth of question and answer, it can remain hidden for a long time. One way DW addresses this is through its great variety of moves. Many of them involve detailing the character in various ways (like the fighter's ancestral weapon option) that build on established fantasy tropes and tease out the PCs identity and campaign focus in interesting ways (great work on these Adam and Sage!).<br/><br/>So the new Spout Lore inverts the question and answer form by inviting the player to expound while the DM assents, denies, or fills in detail. This is a highly productive inversion and a potential game changer; even a genre changer. There are some speed bumps though.<br/><br/>I want to talk about the game I ran at GPNW a bit. The adventure was a one-page outline I put together for GPWN called "Trapped in a Dwarf Hole". The Dwarf Hole is focused on dungeon survival and details a hazardous environment that the PCs must traverse to survive. The environmental threats are lightly detailed, but the more meta questions about the environment are purposely left blank. Through several spout lore rolls, the players, not the DM, established an overarching story that explained why the dungeon existed, why the threats were arranged the way they were, and how to address the issues raised by the answers to these questions. As a group at the table, we invented a horrible curse, a way to remove it, and a set of risks involved in trying to do so. As DM I was pretty well able to weave the elements of my prep into the story in a way that satisfied my principles. That's a pretty huge win for the DM. There was also a great moment where Sage's fighter blew his Lore roll, and spouted that Dwarven Traps were often set off by stepping into moonbeams (that's Elves, dummy!). This led to some hilarious play as Sage went around the dungeon recklessly stepping into rooms because "there aren't any moonbeams."<br/><br/>There are a couple of issues though. First, the new Spout Lore cuts across the grain of ODD as it is commonly played*. It's not a philosophical issue, but it re-frames the conversation in a way that may be unfamiliar to players, and therefore uncomfortable or disjointed for them. It felt quite natural to me, but mostly because it's a way of playing that my own group uses often in Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>There's also a mechanical issue. As DM, one of the things I must do is remain true to my prep. This means that some of the lore spouted is going to be wrong. As the DM, it's my job to say "no, that's not true." This puts the character in the position of having spouted something, being wrong about it, and having better information as a result of knowing that they were wrong. There's a fictional weirdness here that feels rather odd in play. Spouting \u201cwrong\u201d feels like failure, and fictionally looks like failure, but gives you better information and thus an advantage moving forward.<br/><br/>The new Spout Lore really highlights the differences between DW and ODD, and I love that about it. I think it's part of what makes the game new and different. I suspect that if you carefully address player expectations and look at how the move addresses the fiction, you'll be able to smooth it into the rest of the rules pretty well.<br/><br/>* For my definition of "old school", I look to Matthew Finch's Old School Primer: <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming/3159558" rel="nofollow">http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming/3159558</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334224/#Comment_334224" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T11:00:44+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 11:00AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>There's also a mechanical issue.

Spout Lore, by it's name and description, implies that it's something your character is actively doing out loud to the other characters. This leads to moments where you might boldly assert something, roll well, and then be told by the GM that it's not true. At which point, fictionally, you're left in this weird stance of then saying, "Uh, I mean, actually, it's like this instead." That's a pretty big fictional disconnect for me. It might be as simple as making it "Recall Lore" instead or otherwise position it as something internal rather than external to the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334227/#Comment_334227" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T11:09:56+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 11:09AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2011 11:13AM by John_Harper.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent assessment, Tony! The inversion you talk about was on my mind when I wrote the move. It's very tricky to construct a player-move that allows some setting authorship, without "crossing the line" of player/DM responsibilities. The new Spout Lore is skating very close to the line, and maybe even tipping over a bit, which is what Lukas encountered, I think.<br/><br/>My main goal was to make sure Spout Lore was not a lame stand-in for Spot rolls. Spot rolls aren't required in DW (I think they're actually harmful to play, in fact) so I tried to revise the move to make it fail for that use. The DM tells you what's there as the normal course of play -- especially including half-hidden figures in the dark and strange patterns in the floor tiles. Rolling to "spot the adventure" always sucks, and can be tossed right out for DW play.<br/><br/>But it's a tightrope act. Spout Lore doesn't let the player invent what's in the dungeon, it lets them expound on what they think it means or where it came from or what it might do (as players are wont to do) and then, depending on the roll, get their ideas confirmed, clarified, or revised according to the DM's prep.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I'm not entirely convinced that it's the right move for the game. Adam wrote a different version which is also good, and hews more closely to standard ODD practice.<br/><br/><b>Adam's version:</b><br/><i>When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+Int. On a 10+ the GM will tell you something interesting and something useful about the subject relevant to your situation. On a 7-9 the GM will only tell you something interesting - it's on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you "How do you know this?"  Tell him the truth, now.</i><br/><br/>EDIT <a href="/forums/profile/Lukas">@Lukas</a>: I've seen that same fictional hiccup. It's an issue, yeah. For me, it's weird to have a move where the PC doesn't actually <i>do</i> something, though. "Remembering" doesn't cut it, for me, as an action taken in play. But maybe I can come around to a new point of view on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334228/#Comment_334228" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T11:19:00+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 11:19AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For clarity's sake, what is the state of Dungeon World?

It's a big risk for any player to say "I want to contribute this to the game!" but then to have the GM be able to say "no, that's wrong."<br/><br/>I feel like Spout Lore is there to expound on the details.  To take what the GM has already given you and fill in the character knowledge where the player knowledge is lacking.  Sure, Avon the Magnificent knows all about the Goblin Marches but Adam doesn't.  Why would I?  <br/><br/>This is the problem I had, in game - <i>"Spout Lore doesn't let the player invent what's in the dungeon, it lets them expound on what they think it means or where it came from or what it might do (as players are wont to do) and then, depending on the roll, <b>get their ideas confirmed, clarified, or revised</b> according to the DM's prep."</i><br/><br/>Emphasis mine.  The players are always going to use this version of Spout Lore to say things like "Oh, well, shit, of course these monsters are totally susceptible to Magic Missiles.  It's their one true weakness!" and even on a 10+ the GM is going to "clarify" with "Nope, that's wrong, you're thinking of some other monster." and on we go.  The move did basically nothing.  <br/><br/>I feel like what we're trying to force with the current Spout Lore is better handled by the GM just remembering to <b>Leave Blanks</b> and <b>Ask Questions</b> because if they're doing their job correctly, they're letting the players contribute flavor anyway.  <br/><br/>I think that Tony and I are on the same page on this one, mostly.  His feedback seems to fall in line with how I understand the Spout Lore move fits into the rest of the game.<br/><br/>As for making it a result of a concrete action, well, that's a bit trickier.  Really, when it comes down to it, the players are seeing a thing in the game they want to know more about and think that their characters already do.  It's the move that bridges the gap between Player and Character knowledge.  So, really, what the character is doing IS just searching their memory and saying "Hey!  I know about this!" while the player is saying "What do I know about this?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334237/#Comment_334237" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T11:31:31+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 11:31AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the move's mushyness is slightly eased by thinking of your "accumulated knowledge" as a thing, like the psychic maelstrom.

I do think your version might be better for DW.<br/><br/>But I can't help nitpicking! Your interpretation of my version of the move is a bit off.<br/><br/>If a player Spouts Lore and says that Ogres are vulnerable to magic missiles, and rolls a 10+, the DM has 2 options: 1) Roll with it, and say, "That's true, but they're specifically vulnerable to the dazzling light caused by the magic. Direct the missiles at the eyes." or 2) Clarify and say, "True, magic missiles will hurt an Orge. But you also recall that they're most vulnerable to weapons of cold iron." On a 10+ you always get solid, true, <i>useful</i> information to act on, not just a negation.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's moot. My move, while possibly interesting, appears to blur the line between player/GM roles (even though it really doesn't!) and is prone to misuse and confusion in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334241/#Comment_334241" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T11:44:33+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 11:44AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you need two moves? <i>Spout Lore</i> and <i>Discern Realities</i> seem to serve the same purpose: getting information about something.  If knowledge and spot checks are lame, maybe you don't need to try to replicate the difference between them.  Or you could break them up like the two Read moves in AW, by having them target different types of things.  Maybe one targets "lore" while the other targets "tactics" or something.  So a ranger "reads tactics" on a poisoned arrow and learns/says "They're goblins, they're using night-tooth venom, and they have sophisticated metalworking" while a wizard "reads lore" on the same arrow and learns/says, "They are devotees to the serpent god Vlagnoth, whose annual festival is coming up in two days.

On a 10+, the GM will clarify your knowledge \u2013 adding details, dispelling untrue facts, and making useful and interesting information clear to you. On a 7-9, the GM will confirm a single true and useful fact about the subject. On a miss, the GM will give you information that is dangerously wrong. If you act on this incorrect knowledge as if it was true, or convince others to do so, mark xp.<br/><br/><br/>Michael, no matter what, the flow of information is from the GM to the player. The player just gets a chance to suggest what information they want. I'm thinking about this kind of thing, which I recall seeing a lot in d20:<br/><br/>Player: "Okay, I make my knowledge check about the Red Gibbons of the Dread Mountains."<br/>GM: "Sure, what do you want to know?"<br/>Player: "Can we use the unicorn meat to distract them? If we have to run away, are they less likely to follow beyond the tree line?"<br/>GM: "Yeah, both of those. Red Gibbons are "Red" because they're often drenched in blood, they love meat. I bet unicorn's pretty tasty too, nice and lean. They're also tree-hunters, dropping down on their prey. They're at a disadvantage without trees, so they instinctively stay in them." <br/><br/>With this Spout Lore, in DW:<br/><br/>Player: "I tell everyone what I know about Red Gibbons of the Dread Mountains."<br/>GM: 'Sounds like Spout Lore. Looks like you got a 12, nice!"<br/>Player: "Well, there's an ancient myth where Helferth descends from on high and drives the Red Gibbons into the trees so that humanity will be safe from their predatory ways. They eat meat and lots of it, so Helferth dies their fur red, so everyone would see them."<br/>GM: "I'm sure some would disagree with you on the reasons, but that's all true. Red Gibbons live in trees, so you can escape them if you get out of the forest, and they are vicious carnivores who would love that unicorn meat."<br/><br/>This isn't player authorship, at all! It's the player prompting the GM, but they're prompting them with solid fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334253/#Comment_334253" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T12:30:28+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 12:30PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, it's worth mentioning that you can totally do the new Spout Lore thing using the old Spout Lore move. All you have to do as MC is ask the players for suggestions. Even on a fail, you can ask the player "what does your PC thing about this." It's kind of a grey area depending on the dynamic of your group. Maybe the description of spout lore can be tweaked to make sure the MC knows this is an option.<br/><br/>Jonathan points out that Spout/Discern can look pretty similar sometimes. I don't think it's a problem, since they ask different kinds of questions, but it's also true that the new Spout Lore makes them radically different, which is a good. Maybe you could add to the Spout Lore with something like "spend a hold to make some crazy shit up, and have the DM either decide it's true, or deny it and offer something else."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334255/#Comment_334255" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T12:33:34+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 12:33PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To expand on Tony's point, the new Spout Lore can also kind of do the old Spout Lore:<br/><br/>GM: "What do you know about trolls?"<br/>Player: "Nothing, really.

Spouting incorrect lore or "catching yourself before you say something incorrect" just straight-up sucks.  Sounds like a recipe for GMs killing player input.  But there needs to be a fictional trigger to the move, like Adam says, where the player does something.<br/><br/>Notably, the only AW move about remembering things (that I can think of) is the Quarantine session move, "The Past," which has some player authoring where sometimes the player answers the question. But there you're answering mostly about stuff that hasn't been fully established in the fiction or the GM's prep, though it clearly builds on already established information.<br/><br/>Here's a brainwave: <i>What if you structure the move as the GM asking questions of the player?</i>  Since that's something you're already supposed to do anyway?  Like, "When you spout lore, on a hit, the GM will ask you questions about what you've found, questions where they aren't sure of the answer yet. On a 10+, you can also ask them one question as well."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334284/#Comment_334284" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T13:34:32+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  1:34PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really, what we're trying to do here is write a move that can help bridge the knowledge transfer.

I consider it more or less a rewording of John's move:<br/><br/>When you consult your accumulated knowledge and experience on a topic say what facts, information, and conjecture you have so far, then roll+Int. On a 10+ the GM will expand on your information, correcting conjecture, pointing out other pertinent facts, and tying it all together. On a 7-9 the GM will correct one conjecture or add one useful bit of knowledge. On a 6-9 the GM will give you a dangerously false conclusion. If you act on it or cause someone else to act on it mark XP.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>Weak Hit<br/>Player: "Well, we know there's a trap here, since the dead body came from the stairs, and it's gotta be a dwarven trap since this is a dwarf hole. What conclusions can I draw from that about dwarven traps?"<br/>GM: "Sounds like you're spouting lore?"<br/>Player: "Yup. 9!"<br/>GM: "As you take that all into consideration you notice the blood trail, it's not from the stairs, its from the closed door. Whatever killed it is probably over there..."<br/>Player: "Ah! I say to everyone "get behind me, the trap must be this way!"<br/><br/>Solid Hit<br/>Player: "Well, we know there's a trap here, since the dead body came from the stairs, and it's gotta be a dwarven trap since this is a dwarf hole. What conclusions can I draw from that about dwarven traps?"<br/>GM: "Sounds like you're spouting lore?"<br/>Player: "Yup. 12!"<br/>GM: "As you take that all into consideration you notice the blood trail, it's not from the stairs, its from the closed door. Whatever killed it is probably over there. And from your past experiences dwarves prefer sound-based traps, since sound moves well in tunnels."<br/>Player: "I drop my voice to a loud whisper: "I think we should just take the stairs, traps that way."<br/><br/>Miss<br/>Player: "Well, we know there's a trap here, since the dead body came from the stairs, and it's gotta be a dwarven trap since this is a dwarf hole. What conclusions can I draw from that about dwarven traps?"<br/>GM: "Sounds like you're spouting lore?"<br/>Player: "Yup. 5!"<br/>GM: "Well, let is something rare in the dwarven tunnels, so you're pretty sure moonbeams would be the most likely trigger to the trap."<br/>Player: "Might as well act on that. 'Hey everyone, no moonbeams here, so I think we're safe. Let's just move on.'"<br/><br/>Conjecture<br/>Player: "There's Red Gibbons in those hills, and I know of the ancient story where Helferth came down and saved humanity from the Red Gibbons by banishing them to the tress, where they would live out there days. He also marked them red, since they love meat so much, so prey could spot them and stay away. Which means we can use the unicorn steak to distract them and run for a clearing if need be."<br/>GM: "Wow, that's a lot of conjecture, make your roll"<br/>Player: "Sure, 10."<br/>GM: "That behavior certainly matches up with everything you've seen and the villagers stories."<br/>Player: "So, friends, let's head that way.

That's how it's been done before!<br/><br/>However, part of the interest is (I'm guessing) making Intelligence important, to differentiate between characters.<br/><br/>I would imagine that something like AW's "take a +1 forward if you act on the answers" could be good here.<br/><br/>I could see myself doing as something like:<br/><br/>Player: "I have studied the Trolls' familial structures, at the Library with Master Fu Mor..."<br/>GM: "Yes, ok, here's what you learned:"<br/><br/>or maybe<br/><br/>GM: "Cool. Why don't you tell us what you learned there?"<br/><br/>The GM can always pick the second option if s/he doesn't have a ready answer, and let the player make it up. But for important bits that might interfere with other GM prep, you can just tell the player first.<br/><br/>So, the player says what they know *about*, but not what they actually know. And then the GM fills them in or tells them to do so themselves.<br/><br/>In AW/Dungeon World terms? Maybe the best way to do this is with a list of questions, as is. Is there another way?<br/><br/><br/>Edit: Cross-posted with everyone after John's comment! But I really like Sage's "Here's what I see.

I'd like to keep that tied to int, as it gives everyone something to do with int that's useful. There's nothing wrong with asking the GM questions, and maybe that's what we'll do with it. But I think there's another way, that emulates the knowledge check kind of roll and allows for Int to mean "knowledge of the world at large."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334322/#Comment_334322" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T14:22:58+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  2:22PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that we've got this thread going, I might as well share one other option I've been thinking about: What if the basic Int move* was something like "Strategize?"<br/><br/>Strategize (Int)<br/>When you explain your plan of attack roll+Int. On a 10+ describe three parts to your plan. On a 7-9, describe two. The first person to act on each part of your plan takes +1 when acting on it.<br/><br/><br/>I kind of want to write a failure clause too, where your plan is dangerous, but I don't know about that. Seems unusual here.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*We're keeping all the D&amp;D stats. For each stat to be useful to everyone, there has to be a basic move for it, or some common use (Load, HP). So we're more or less stuck with a basic move for each stat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334325/#Comment_334325" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T14:27:38+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  2:27PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One nitpicky thing, in some of the versions, I see the idea that on a 6- the DM will mislead the players.

Providing a dangerous falsehood is already available as a hard move, because it's the natural consequences of the situation. It doesn't need to be in the move text. Sometimes your hard move is something else entirely, and you as MC need the freedom to go there. Splitting the party because they failed to spout lore on which way they should go is MC gold. In fact, I wasn't able to handle spout lore well as an MC until I realized that falsehood wasn't my only option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334340/#Comment_334340" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T15:28:58+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  3:28PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great Tony.

Gameworld info that:<br/>1) character &amp; player both know<br/>2) character <i>definitely</i> knows but player does not<br/>3) character <i>might</i> know but player does not<br/>4) character &amp; player both don't know<br/><br/>Any given speech might be all 4.  I say, "Comrades!  This dwarf is dead!  We should bury him in the manner of dwarves!  I suspect he was killed by a gibbon!  After all, gibbons secretly control this dungeon!"<br/><br/>The GM must then parse this.  The dead dwarf is a fact already established, needing no response.  How dwarves get buried is something my character, as a fellow dwarf, definitely knows, so the GM should tell me the truth of this regardless of any roll.  My gibbon dungeon control claim is clearly bullshit, as my character has no way of knowing that, so the GM can ignore it, letting the statement stand.<br/><br/>"I suspect he was killed by a gibbon!" is what we roll for.<br/><br/>My inclination as GM would be to dish on dwarven burials <i>before</i> any rolling, just in case the players then decide they don't care who killed him and no roll is necessary.\n<blockquote>On a 10+ the GM will expand on your information, correcting conjecture, pointing out other pertinent facts, and tying it all together. On a 7-9 the GM will correct one conjecture or add one useful bit of knowledge.</blockquote>I like this but would re-word it to reflect my narrowed focus above:<br/><br/>"On a 10+ the GM will refine your theory, bringing in other data to correct inaccuracies, flesh out details, and tie it all together. On a 7-9 the GM will correct the least accurate part of a theory and add one useful bit of knowledge."<br/><br/>Personally, I'd change "tie it together" and "useful bit of knowledge" to "highlight two opportunities" and "highlight one opportunity", but that's probably a <i>Delve</i> thing.<br/><br/>As for dishing on dwarven burials, maybe add "Always say truths characters would know, when you are asked" to the GM's "Always say" list, or "Tell players relevant stuff their characters would know" to the Principles or something.\n<blockquote>On a 6- the GM will give you a dangerously false conclusion. If you act on it or cause someone else to act on it mark XP.</blockquote>This incentive feels weird to me.  "Hey guys, should we do something dumb and improve our characters, or continue trying to think up something smart?"  <br/><br/>I'm much more a fan of letting the GM just make a hard move, leaving open the possibility that they might tell you useful truths in the course of that.  <br/><br/>Example:<br/>GM picks the "mislead" move, looks at his Spider Pit Trap behind Door 3, thinks "maybe the spiders ate the gibbons!" and says, "yep, these are gibbon wounds, and their tracks lead to Door 3!"  Now the players know something bad is lurking, because of the bad roll, but they'll prepare for a gibbon fight rather than a spider fight.  At the same time, they did learn the truth of the dwarf's death.  Do this once or twice and the players will know it's not as simple as "bad roll = lie we should ignore".  Especially if killing the spiders actually gets them somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334374/#Comment_334374" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T17:56:17+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  5:56PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I had no problems with Spout Lore as it was, I do like the idea about a move for "When you study a source of information", whether that source of information is an ancient tome, strange writing on the wall, a monster's fighting technique as it tries to rip your throat out, your own extensive and poorly-organized memories of decades of study, or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334375/#Comment_334375" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T18:05:07+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  6:05PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2011 6:16PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, I dig studying tomes too, but I think a combo of Spout Theories and Discern Realities would cover that for me.

Kinda takes the player out of it.  Maybe start at -2 or -3 to the roll, and improve your odds by doing relevant smart things?

That's fun stuff, but as everyone has been suggesting it is difficult to firewall what the player says in character from the GMs prep so that it does not require revision. Let me have another go:<br/><br/>When a player draws on accumulated knowledge, recite a story from myth or arcane lore and explain where you learnt this lore, then roll +Int: on a 10+, the GM will tell you how that information is relevant to the current situation. On a 7+, the GM points out one aspect of the story that is useful. On a miss the GM makes a hard mive.<br/><br/>The firewalling gets done here by the situating of the information the player provides and the discrepancies the GM points out: "Yes, but the goblins here are red skinned rather than green, which means...." The only real difference between this and the original spout lore move is the difference between making connections and correcting. However, doing the former allows the player to say whatever they like in character without odd retroactive work. <br/><br/>Does this work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334653/#Comment_334653" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T09:47:46+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  9:47AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Piers</cite>When a player draws on accumulated knowledge, recite a story from myth or arcane lore and explain where you learnt this lore, then roll +Int: on a 10+, the GM will tell you how that information is relevant to the current situation.

It sounds like kobold." I'd say something like "I'm suddenly reminded of a story from my university days - my professor told me you can always recognize the kobold tongue by the frequent glottal stops." At which point the GM is wondering how to make that relevant, because they're not kobolds, they're deep insects. And maybe he's already decided that deep insects are unintelligent animals incapable of speech. How does he make it relevant? Add some unplanned kobolds to the game?

You roll determines how insightful your plan is, and the GM's still playing by prep. You say "Let's scale the wall, full armored. I'm sure we have time before the next patrol!" Even on a 10+ you're just giving an action plan that provides a bonus. It doesn't mean the plan was right, it means it was useful to organize people. So yeah, the GM knows there's actually a guard always stationed right on the other side of the wall who's going to hear it. The move didn't contradict that, it just meant that everyone's working together well. They may use that +1 to deal with the unexpected guard even.<br/><br/>Johnstone - The idea is that the lore spouted is what you think you know, the GM combines that with the situation to point you at the truth.

That reminds me of the glottal stops in the speech of Kobolds--they say [...]<br/><br/>GM: Where did you learn that?<br/><br/>Player: I read it in the Red Book of Gorath... / That's what they taught me in seminary... / I learned that fighting Kobolds in the Iron Hills...<br/><br/>GM: Ah, well the term Kobold is used to refer to a wide variety of creatures created by Draconic magics [blah, blah]<br/><br/>This one is always going to be a problem, because the character is Spouting Lore based on very little information and thus has to either guess well or hope that the GM finds the suggestion interesting enough to alter the prep to suit. (And honestly, if no insects have been seen, how difficult would it be to swap in Kobolds?)<br/><br/> I think the trick here is to restrict GM prep specifically to the Dungeon at hand, leaving the world as a whole for players to make with Spout Lore.  Then the GM can compare the tales in the Red Book of Gorath to those in the Ebon Grimoire, point out that the religious dogma of Kersis is based upon divination by fire, or distinguish between the red kobolds of the Iron Hills and the yellow kobolds of this area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334789/#Comment_334789" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T10:13:08+00:00" title="July 16, 2011 10:13AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2011 10:13AM by mease19.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm starting to thing this is a doomed endeavor.

On a 10+, what you say is true--or true enough to be of use. On a 7-9, it's true or useful, but there's a catch to it as well. On a 6 or less, you might learn to keep your big mouth shut one of these days, but this wasn't it, apparently.<br/><br/>The kobold example is dodgy, because if the GM has priority over the dungeon, the player can't say these are kobolds. "Those are kobolds I hear behind the door" is a statement about the dungeon, not some knowledge the character has at his disposal. But if he declares "I fought kobolds in the Iron Hills, I know their speech, so I can tell of this is kobold or not," there's two possibilities:<br/>1.) GM says: "These are not kobolds."<br/>2.) GM has no idea what these monsters were going to be 'cause he was slack on prep and says "sure, these are kobolds! Tell us about kobolds! What are they like?"<br/>So that move is a bit of a shot in the dark.<br/><br/>However, if the bandit fighter, the thief, and the noble wizard (all PCs) bust in and kill some kobolds, the wizard could spout lore afterwards: "The captain of Eastfort is offering coin for any kobold heads that are brought to him. These aren't just monsters, they are treasure too!" This is a statement about the world the wizard lives in, not this strange dungeon he is exploring.<br/><br/>On a 10+, now there's some Eastfort buying kobold heads.<br/>On a 7-9, maybe the GM says "Yes, but this captain hangs every criminal he finds, no matter the circumstances."<br/>And the wizard player can say: "Oh, sure, but I don't tell <i>them</i> that," pointing at the other players (a bandit and a thief).<br/><br/>And on a miss, the GM can cut to them, two days later, standing over the smoking ruin of Eastfort with their bags of kobold heads, the other two glaring at the wizard.<br/><br/>(Also, the "how it is useful" caveat would allow me to roleplay a character who talks shit a lot without having to roll for it:<br/>Me: "Oh, this orc's helmet reminds me of the fancy golden masks that the marcher lords all wear into battle. So pretty!"<br/>Another PC: "And?"<br/>Me: "And what?

(I think?) Piers is proposing the same delineation between player and GM authority as in Apocalypse World, only here it's player-initiated, because of the spout lore move, and not MC-initiated, as in AW. Those two areas (familiar and unfamiliar) are defined by the GM, who decides when you are dealing with familiar and unfamiliar stuff.<br/><br/>The players could set those boundaries, too, though. If each character has a few areas of expertise written down, those could be what the PC spouts lore about. Then the GM can easily see what areas of the world he can get the players to make up. By including gaps especially tailored to those areas of expertise, he's leaving room for the players to fill stuff in. So maybe one character has River Trade, Kobolds, and Sellswords as his areas of expertise. The GM can put kobolds in the dungeon and let the player detail them. Or maybe there is some other monster, but when the PCs come across a trap, that player says "Kobolds make traps much like these! Be on the lookout for scaly midgets while I attempt to disarm this one."<br/><br/>It adds another element to character creation, or these could be filled in during play. Or, they could change all the time -- perhaps the GM even hands a few out at the beginning of a session?

This part I understand and agree with. I'm just quibbling with the specific wording: you don't find out how many statements you get clarification on until <i>after</i> you roll, but you have to make at least one <i>before</i> you roll, so really what you get is a clarification of your statement on a hit (7 or more), and an extra 2 statements if you get a 10+. Does that make sense?<br/>Make a statement, roll, get 7-9, GM says true or false.<br/>Make a statement, roll, get 10+, GM says true or false, repeat up to twice without rolling.<br/>Right?<br/>Or did you mean that the player says as many statements as they want before rolling, and then the GM comments on 1 or 3 of them after the roll?<br/><br/>As to the incompetent part? Well, okay, let's just say that I would absolutely LOVE to play Bumbling Mystery Solvers, and if you give ME your move in a game, I am gonna play that game SO HARD. Maybe that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334843/#Comment_334843" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T19:02:55+00:00" title="July 16, 2011  7:02PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2011 7:04PM by mease19.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I could probably word it better.  The intention was that you spout all your lore up front (you literally spout the lore, in character, to the other players) and then roll after the fact.  Then the GM says the truth/fallacy of all, one, or none of your statements/details.  If you rolled a 7+ you get to benefit from acting on the information, either way; though, you have more info to act on and more choice on which information to act on when you roll a 10+.  For example, if on a 10+ you say something true and something false then you have a choice of which benefit you want.  On a miss, you've still spouted that lore but no one else knows if its true or not (but it might be, you've just made the GM's job easier by giving him something to use as a truth or to use against you as a hard move by playing against your expectations) and you don't get a reward for acting on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334853/#Comment_334853" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T20:13:28+00:00" title="July 16, 2011  8:13PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay, my mistake.

You roll determines how insightful your plan is, and the GM's still playing by prep. You say "Let's scale the wall, full armored. I'm sure we have time before the next patrol!" Even on a 10+ you're just giving an action plan that provides a bonus. It doesn't mean the plan was right, it means it was useful to organize people.</blockquote>Gotcha.  Cool.  "Useful to coordinate the party" makes sense to me as a purpose for Strategize.  That's probably a good call, to focus on that for the mechanics, and to let the quality of the plan speak for itself without mechanical parsing.  I didn't get that at first.  Dunno if it's the way the move is worded or if it's just me.<br/><br/>Didja have any thoughts on <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=334373" rel="nofollow">my take</a> on Spout Theories?  I suspect the dynamics of free knowledge / earned knowledge / iffy knowledge are extremely important in this game, and it's important to be clear on where each kind comes from both mechanically and in-fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14706/dungeon-world-hey-gpnw-players-we-have-a-question-for-you" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14706/dungeon-world-hey-gpnw-players-we-have-a-question-for-you" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14706/dungeon-world-hey-gpnw-players-we-have-a-question-for-you/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14706%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14706%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
