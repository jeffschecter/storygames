It is kind of a follow up of this <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3316&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">thread I wrote here some two years ago</a>.<br/><br/><b>But first the context :</b><br/>I'm back play testing Avalanche after a long break (at least from a public point of view), and we engaged in a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=29048.msg271474#msg271474" rel="nofollow">Burning Wheel tryout</a>. And well, things didn't go exactly as planned. <br/>We're happy with the play testing but some major issues, some we didn't expect, came in. Turning this "one AP post about BW" into a whole chunk of posts. This is the first one.<br/><br/>Now, to really understand the context, I have to explain that I was DMing the game, with two experienced players and three new players to this hobby. Also, this was our first experience with BW ; playing out with the "simple rules". We were aiming at a "one session" game ; at least, that was the deal with the new players. Good news, this turned out to be a three sessions game so far, at their request. Which I think is a good sign.<br/>Let's put a couple of things aside for the benefit of this conversation :<br/>- We had a real problem with the character creation. This was more of a strategic nature, not related to BW itself. I admit it, we should have done all the PCs together.<br/>- For the first two sessions, we came up with a problem of "driving the group together" as they didn't have a common goal. This was related to the above, but also to the nature of Avalanche (I'll talk about it below), and the misuse of BIT from our part (I won't talk about it here).<br/>- We were playing Avalanche for the first time in a context of "anchored" characters. Those PCs weren't going to explore the world. And BW really helps in this context by providing tools (character creation and BIT).<br/><br/><b>The purpose</b><br/>JoyWriter at the forge, came to me with this comment, which is <i>la raison d'\xeatre</i> of this post. And yeah, we are talking about a game here. So, here's the quote :<br/><i>If that's not clear, it's the difference between a game that fails if you do not seize the moment and the themes/conflicts of the setting, and one that slowly shifts you into the centre of them whether your character goes gladly or not. There's obviously a trade-off in terms of philosophical perspective, similar to the risk of death in other types of game; do we allow the risk of pointlessness so as to represent existential reality (as is often done with death) and the associated fear and drama, or do we soften it because we're more interested in what happens when people are fulfilled and dynamised? Is it more interesting whether we avoid loss and meaninglessness, or how we avoid it?</i><br/><br/>So, based on that, let's talk about purpose in rpg, depending on systems, settings and plots.<br/><i>The default purpose</i><br/>Let's take d20 or its "software" version WoW : what's the purpose of those games ? Get money, get power, kill monsters. I'm not saying you can't have a more personal purpose like, living up in a group, take part in "higher picture" stuff, but I'm saying d20 won't help you with that.<br/><br/><i>A personal purpose</i><br/>Anything that goes from "avenging my sister" to "inquiring about the thieves guild" ; a reason for your PC to live. A purpose. Your own. TSOY helps a lot here, but I think BW is much more personal. In fact, I can't see how you can create a "default" character in BW. And beside character creation, BW surely helps you to drive your character toward that purpose.<br/><br/><i>Questioning your purpose</i><br/>And that's a "touchy" one. Having a purpose is one thing ; questioning it is another. Am I doing the right thing ? Is that really what matters most ? To me, to the others ? Now, I believe that to be able to question your purposes, stuff must happen in the world. Stuff that do not concern you immediately. A war must have started, a catastrophe must have happened, a conspiracy must be going on.<br/>BW (as for TSOY) really helps managing the impact of changing purpose (changing BIT or keys), but, I think, a setting, another product can really help you propose other things to the players ; help you see them questioning their purpose.<br/><br/>Another important thing to me : to arise this question, the "other stuff" must be highly coherent and time dependent. The existentialist question is first and foremost one about <i>time</i>.<br/><br/><i>We're still talking about a game, right ?</i><br/>But is that something you want in a rpg ? I mean, that is something Avalanche can help you do, but would anyone do that ? To be able to question a purpose, someone must somehow stop, take a good look around. It takes time. Time you will not spend on your current purpose.<br/>Thu, a question (JoyWriter's one) : in a game of rpg, are you best to keep your players "on track" driven and occupied by their current purposes or do you change the rhythm of the game, the pace, as to allow "space" to question the purposes of the group ?<br/><br/>And, we might even go as far as asking "why one is the best ?". To that, I'd say I don't know. This is a judgment's call.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256144/#Comment_256144" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T09:59:30+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  9:59AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2010 10:00AM by Daniel H..">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>Thu, a question (JoyWriter's one) : in a game of rpg, are you best to keep your players "on track" driven and occupied by their current purposes or do you change the rhythm of the game, the pace, as to allow "space" to question the purposes of the group ?</blockquote>\nTo me, the answer is none of the above.  The players will pursue what is interesting to them.  Sometimes this will be in response to in-game stimuli (\u201cI don\u2019t want my character to kill his older brother so that he can be king.

If you don't gain audience, then what? Perhaps the king's wife is the next likely target. She presents her own set of problems. And you do get audience with the PM, you still have to convince him. Succeed and you've only got two more kingdoms to go. Fail and you're going to deal with some heavy fallout -- because he is awesome, the GM will have set a brutal objective against yours.

This is just not my problem ...<br><br>Disclaimer : you may, at all time, tell me that what I'm describing doesn't interest you, in the sense, that would not be the type of game you'd like to play. Fine. That said, Avalanche is a little bit like the TV show <i>24</i>, but on <i>speed</i> (or cafeine, or put your favorite drug there). And that's the type of game I want to play. Now, back to the discussion.<br><br>First, BW handles this kind of situation (the one Luke described) very, very well. And, let's agree it is not about "reunion of the three kingdoms" <i>or</i> "go kill some monsters" ; for that matters, I don't think BW suits well. <br>So, what is the <i>or</i> about ?<br><br/>Suppose that your players choose this belief (the three kingdoms) : they are telling you this is what they want to play, right ? Now, let's take a look at what could happen <i>at the same time</i>, while they are trying to reunite the three kingdoms :<br/>- There is a very evil sorcerer that one of the counselor of one of the kingdom has awakened. This counselor has been turned into an undead, puppet of the sorcerer, who is seeking to build an army of undead in secret.<br/>- The goblyns, neighbor of the three kingdoms, are being reunited by a leader. Prophecy told that he would come and that he would destroy the "three kingdoms".<br/>- Humans are "abusing" nature and the evil heart of the forest is awakening ; threatening goblyns and human alike.<br/><br/>Thus, maybe the players will (or not) succeed in reuniting the three kingdoms, but only ruins of those would remain, as undead, goblyns and nature are fighting each other (taking this to the extreme). Does this mean that their belief was futile ? I guess yes. But, yeah, I think there is enough examples of those kind of stories in literature and movies to buy this in. Now, would it be interesting ? Sure, why not.<br/><br/>Possible reactions :<br/>- Too much is happening : unrealistic. Players wouldn't buy that. Discard the above.<br/>- Look, we've picked up the wrong game, this is not about the three kingdom, finally. Discard the above.<br/>- Use those elements as "chain of objectives" for the players. First, "reunion", then "conservation" (against various foes) which would seem logical. But, hey, this is managed as "chapters" and I don't want that.<br/>- Use those elements to support the belief of the players : the three kingdoms need to be reunited <i>because</i> of emerging and urgent threat. You come close to the previous one.<br/>- I'm sure there are others.<br/>My choice ? Challenge the players about their beliefs !!!<br/><br/>Now, how do you manage that ?<br/>For one thing, the DM will need to "introduce" parts of those "stories" as the game go along. Nature is becoming more and more aggressive. Rumors of goblyns mustering an army, making intrusion into the humans' lands. Maybe, they'll encounter some undead ...<br/>Anyway, this takes time ; time players won't be spending on the reunion of the three kingdoms.<br/><br/>If the players decide that the sorcerer (or nature) <i>stakes</i> are more important than their current belief, BW provides me a powerful tool to manage it. <br/>But, honestly, having players discuss about <i>what they believe in</i> (is it the right thing ?), BW doesn't help there. As I think that when you manage "elements" <i>inside</i> a given belief you are not questioning it.<br/><br/>And the question is still here : as a DM would you introduce those parts (thus allowing possible questioning from the players) or "hide" them, so to have the players stick to <i>their </i>beliefs ? After all, that is what they want the game to be about, no ?<br/><br/>Now, I do realize that this is not an easy question ; it might even turn out to be confusing.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256572/#Comment_256572" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-14T15:38:13+00:00" title="February 14, 2010  3:38PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luke, Daniel, I'm terribly sorry ...

My character was a heretical nun, and her nemesis was the abbess of the local convent.  I\u2019d spent almost the entire six-month campaign dealing with the abbess.  She was suspected of dark dealings and the conflicts between my character\u2019s newfound faith, the orthodox faith, and their suspicions of one another were big drivers of play.<br/><br/>In one of our final sessions, there was a crucial Duel of Wits between my character and the abbess.  Hesitating after a failed dismiss, I considered having my character beg for mercy, repenting her sins and asking to be re-admitted to the convent.  Now, this action was not premeditated; it would have flown in the face of how I had played the character the entire campaign, but still it was interesting to me, the person playing the game.<br/><br/>Does this address what you\u2019re after?  In Burning Wheel, it\u2019s easy to have a change of heart.  My character had a long-standing Belief about the abbess; I could have rewritten it that session to reflect the new situation.  When we awarded Artha that night, likely I would have been up for Moldbreaker.  Even though my action wasn\u2019t thought-out ahead of time, the game\u2019s mechanics gave me touchstones to make something like this meaningful and easy to communicate to the other players.<br/><br/>At the same time, it\u2019s possible to play a slow-burn shift in Burning Wheel.  For example, I can play my character against her Instinct in such a way that the group decides eventually to change it.  Or I can play her in such a way that the group votes her a Trait that reflects her evolving character.  In both instances (the quick change and the slow), what\u2019s important is that they\u2019re focused on tangible things like the character\u2019s BITs and recognized by the other people at the table.<br/><br/>I like the idea of characters changing over time or in response to in-game stimuli, and Burning Wheel handles this better than a lot of games I\u2019ve played.  It puts that dynamic above the table where the group can see it clearly.

Let's be clear : I understand what you're describing. And yes, BW helps a lot. But this is not <i>my issue</i>. My issue is the <i>other thing</i>. I've given a lot of thought into this and couldn't find the right way to describe it. That said, I do feel a lot of shame : am I <i>that bad</i> at describing what Avalanche does ? <br/>Well, anyway, first : let's not take this conversation so seriously, right ? <br/>Second, I'll propose you three ways (I'll call them "take") to address my problem. Of course, they will be shorter, but, hey, you tell me which one you get *the best*, or maybe none ... pffff ... Okay, here we go !!!<br/><br/><b>Take One</b><br/>We're sitting in a bar, quite drunk, talking about rpg, BW and Avalanche in particular. In hope, we won't remember this conversation in the morning.<br/><i>- Hey, so I guess, we can "simulate" the futility of life. The facts that most (or all) of what we do makes no real sense ?<br/>- I suppose so. Except for yourself, right ? Otherwise, why should we continue ?<br/>- But still, your *existence* still takes hold into a cultural environment, linked to a history, embedded into a greater scheme of events (the world of your time), <i>projected</i> into a time-line. This must means something, no ? Could you discard it ?<br/>- Yes or no. But why should I care ? Why should I want to be "a man of my world and time" ?<br/>- Question is not *why*, but *if* ... and in the case the answer is *yes*, what <i>tools</i> do we have at our disposal ?</i><br/><br/>Maybe the solution is to have a belief like "I'm aware of the surrounding world" or "I'm ready to question all my purposes" ? That way, you state to the DM that's the type of game you want.<br/><br/><b>Take two</b><br/>Let's take your convent example. <br/>How much time did it take you to play this game, in term of meta time ? What were the events happening at the same time ? Let's say, you played in a world, in a period of very peaceful time (i.e. nothing else happened), was it deliberate ?<br/>Let's say, I propose you, as a DM (as a way to propose my vision) that in that time, your religion (i.e. outside the convent) has become "enemy of the people" and priests would be hunted, convent burned down. Let's suppose that this "story that would be happening in the big world of your time", would take as long as the campaign you played, how would you have liked me to present it to you ? Rumors ? Call of distress from other convents ? Discard it ? <br/>Given that "higher stake", is there a chance that you would have question your purpose (read "belief") ? Doesn't your opposition to the abbess seems a little *futile* in that context ?<br/><br/><b>Take three</b><br/>Look, what I want is to <i>sell </i>you a big setting with a lot of plots, all occurring <i>at the same time</i> (read : put a little pressure on your players) ; something that you have never seen before. And, this setting, combines with BW, will allow you to question your purpose/belief (the meaning you give to your life, which, I think, is not a <i>little</i> thing), something that BW alone can't do.<br/><br/><b>Conclusion</b><br/>I'm really only repeating myself in all three takes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258764/#Comment_258764" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T11:12:15+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 11:12AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>Maybe the solution is to have a belief like "I'm aware of the surrounding world" or "I'm ready to question all my purposes" ?

The campaign I cited was the follow-up to another, short campaign, so the players had a fair amount of context for what was going on in the setting.  Shortly before the Duel of Wits with the abbess, the characters had been asked to leave the town and never return.  If the game master wanted to introduce elements of what would have been going on outside of the village, a fine time would have been when our characters were forced to hit the road.<br/><br/>I\u2019ll restate: the GM\u2019s role is to introduce elements that challenge my character.  If practitioners of my character\u2019s religion are being hunted down outside of her village, then that certainly complicates her life when she is banished from her home.  But until we get to that point, it\u2019s merely detail.  The conflict between my character and the abbess was enough to drive several sessions of play, so I don\u2019t see the necessity to put further complications on top of that until it is called for in the natural course of play.<br/><br/>Had I know about this all along, it might have informed my play.  Would my character have risked as much knowing that certain death awaited her outside of her village?  We can\u2019t say because that\u2019s not the situation as we created it.  It would have colored her approach to dealing with the abbess, too; again, I can\u2019t comment further because that wasn\u2019t our game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>Look, what I want is to <i>sell</i> you a big setting with a lot of plots, all occurring <i>at the same time</i> (read : put a little pressure on your players) ; something that you have never seen before.

We do not want to play the same type of game. I'm telling you that for the type of game I want, no kind of technique can help me.\n<blockquote>When I play Burning Wheel, I want specifically to explore the characters and situations the group creates at the beginning of play.</blockquote>\nWhen I play (be it BW or some other crunch) I want specifically to explore the situations the group came up with, but I also want to address those issues <i>in the context</i> of a bigger picture. This is for me, as an <i>individual</i> and a player, the only way to <i>give sense</i> to those believes/purposes/situations. I want to explore the world, the stakes of the current world, thru those beliefs. But they are not the end by themselves. This is where I start ; I hope I will get challenged so that, either I end somewhere else, or I end there because this is what I want (given I have seen the other stuff).\n<blockquote>What does Avalanche offer me that I couldn\u2019t get either on my own, or from mining an established fictional world, like Westeros or the Forgotten Realms?</blockquote>\nAvalanche provides you with a storyboard of a living world without a lot of details (unlike Westeros). The world is alive (unlike FR): if you stay in an inn for a month, the world would have changed around you. And maybe to best answered your question : the <i>mining</i> part !!! Avalanche is built in a way that you wouldn't need to mine it to have something useful at the table.\n<blockquote>I don\u2019t think discussing things in terms of hypothetical situations is helpful.</blockquote>\nCan we agree, at least, that this would have be a <i>very different</i> game ? I'm not talking about details here, but about structural elements. You and your players wouldn't have approach the game the same way. And, for me, both ways are fine.\n<blockquote>I\u2019m sorry; I don\u2019t understand this one.

To my shallow roleplaying-mind, one can achieve something in a roleplaying game either through technique or through mechanism.  In Avalanche, what kind of mechanisms are in place for you to achieve the type of game you want? <br/><br/>Better yet, would you care to expound on this in a new thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
