I played Burning Wheel for a while as a social skill specialist.  (I had described her as a "lean, mean Duel of Wits machine".)  In that game, social skill use would typically be invoked by (1) an NPC would decide to do something that we didn't like; (2) I would deploy my social skill to make them agree; (3) if I won, they would go along.  <br/><br/>The problem I had was that this sort of social skill use came across as obnoxious aggression.  Besides how it felt at the time, it also influenced how characters acted later.  Other players and even the GM would tend to role-play characters acting resentful after they were forced to agree, rather than being friendlier towards my character.  <br/><br/>So I've been pondering about how to handle social skill use along different lines than treating it as a conflict to be won, and the opponent defeated.  I don't have a complete system yet, just some scattered thoughts about an alternate system: <br/>1) In the big picture, social skills should be used more for winning and keeping allies than for defeating enemies. <br/>2) A group with socially skilled characters should be more effective as a whole than one without.  Social skills aren't just about making other people obey you - they can help you and others work together.  <br/>3) Social skill rolls should be required for social interaction - not just an option.  Characters with low social skill should be the cause of conflict, not just bystanders or weak combatants if there is conflict.  <br/>4) Social interaction isn't just about getting your way - it can also be about communication.  Two people might be in conflict because of lack of social skill, because they don't realize their common ground.  <br/><br/>As for how to implement these...  In FATE, I think that working together could be handled as positive maneuvers.  Emphasize using Rapport or other skills for teamwork maneuvers that help others.  (Roll on the social skill rather than a physical conflict skill.)  I'm not sure how to handle conflict over miscommunication, but there should be required social skill rolls for social interaction - and that could be one outcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319808/#Comment_319808" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-09T13:08:33+00:00" title="April  9, 2011  1:08PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't have rules for it, or have rules that don't focus on winning or losing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319812/#Comment_319812" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-09T13:26:30+00:00" title="April  9, 2011  1:26PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of the issues might be that in a Duel of Wits, resentfulness on the part of the defeated is not always natural due to the compromise mechanics. They came in wanting something and they had to walk away without all of it, but they might have gotten some significant concessions from the victor.  People can (often rightly) consider that a win.  If the victor keeps their word/doesn't fuck them over in other ways/is proven to be right by circumstances the defeated might have very positive attitudes towards them.<br/><br/>In FATE, I've had some success with putting ideas on the opponent in the style of a maneuver.  The cop thinks you did it, you argue/coax/persuade/interact with him and he gains the Aspect "Maybe he didn't do it."  Then in future when you're doing something, you can call on that with a fate chip, or he can, when investigating an alternate suspect/theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319820/#Comment_319820" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-09T15:30:17+00:00" title="April  9, 2011  3:30PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>The problem I had was that this sort of social skill use came across as obnoxious aggression.

I've played a lot of Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard, and while sometimes the stake-setting would take longer than we'd like, I haven't had any notable problems with people being dishonest with it.  <br/><br/>I haven't had issues with the stakes.  I have the social skill - I beat someone in a conflict, and they willingly go along with the stakes.  The issue I have with that is that my character comes across as pushy rather than friendly.  In matters of role-playing outside of the stakes, the characters tend to act as if I have been aggressive/pushy.  So, for example, a merchant is being hostile and won't let me into his house to talk to his daughter.  There is a social conflict, the stakes are whether he lets me in to talk to the daughter.  I win so I get in and talk to the daughter.  However, in other scenes, the merchant doesn't friendlier towards me.  He acts as if I was pushy and aggressive in getting my way when he wanted to keep me out.  You could say that I *was* being pushy/aggressive, but that's sort of my point.  Using social skills to win conflicts comes across as being pushy/aggressive.  I'm interested in alternatives where social skills still have a marked use without coming across this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319862/#Comment_319862" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-09T23:47:23+00:00" title="April  9, 2011 11:47PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're such a girl, John.

Is it a social thing within the group, where you and your opponent just like seeing who can win conflicts and therefore do whatever you can to perpetuate them?  Is it something about that particular situation that called for the merchant to continue to be hostile, like your character's talk with the daughter producing unpleasant consequences for him, or your character's promises and reassurances turning out to be empty?  Is it the type of social skill being used (your character intimidated him or lied to him rather than making a charming, emotional appeal)?  Or is it just some kind of personal thing -- in real life you or the other people in your group avoid social conflicts and tend to see most examples of debate/persuasion as unpleasant and manipulative?<br/><br/><br/>Not that knowing this will necessarily help much with finding an answer, but it at least might narrow down what you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319870/#Comment_319870" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T04:25:59+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  4:25AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In FATE, we've used Fate points for quick social fixes: "Can I spend a FATE point to make him impressed with my authority?".

It feels like both you and the GM were not quite engaging with the system completely in Burning Wheel, in the sense that the future disposition of the opponent in the Duel of Wits was kept off the table--it wasn't your goal, and the GM made changes in attitude without making them part of the compromise.  <br/><br/>How would these work as ways of addressing that problem:<br/><br/>1) It is explicitly assumed by everyone that NPC attitudes won't change dramatically (for good or ill) as a result of a Duel of Wits unless that is part of the stakes / compromise.<br/><br/>2) The player and the GM put forward stakes / consequences that explicitly change those attitudes. Eg: "Fine, he'll let you see her right now, but when he thinks it over he won't like it and next time he sees you he'll be really angry."<br/><br/>Putting those in place might make the whole thing more functional, and I'm sure you can adapt them to Fate in similar ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319882/#Comment_319882" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T07:16:11+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  7:16AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this shows one of the problems with <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9234" rel="nofollow">our obsession with modeling all interactions as conflict</a>. Conversation very rarely follows that model in real life, after all. Effective persuasion doesn't involve "beating" your opponent, it means reaching a point of consensus.<br/><br/>With a FATE game like the Dresden Files, you actually have a pretty interesting way of modeling that, if you can think of zones not just as physical spaces, but potentially as emotional or ideological spaces. Mark out a map of the possible reactions\u2014maybe a spectrum from "Hostile" to "Friendly," maybe something more complex. Rather than marking off stress boxes, use social rolls to move one of the other characters to the next zone; or, roll some more internally-focused skill (Empathy, Discipline, Conviction, etc.) to see if you can find it in yourself to compromise a bit or actually listen to the other party, and move your own position closer. The "conflict" ends when you all inhabit the same zone.<br/><br/>When phrased as a conflict, I can sympathize with the other players who would tend to roleplay that result as having "beaten" the NPC, and anyone who feels beaten would naturally tend towards resentment. With this, I think the zone would provide a good roleplaying prompt. It doesn't look like a defeat, so much as a meeting, and the zone you met in tells you a lot about the attitudes everyone ended up with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319884/#Comment_319884" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T07:37:19+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  7:37AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2011 7:47AM by jenskot.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>I haven't had issues with the stakes.  I have the social skill - I beat someone in a conflict, and they willingly go along with the stakes.  The issue I have with that is that my character comes across as pushy rather than friendly.  In matters of role-playing outside of the stakes, the characters tend to act as if I have been aggressive/pushy.  So, for example, a merchant is being hostile and won't let me into his house to talk to his daughter.  There is a social conflict, the stakes are whether he lets me in to talk to the daughter.  I win so I get in and talk to the daughter.  However, in other scenes, the merchant doesn't friendlier towards me.  He acts as if I was pushy and aggressive in getting my way when he wanted to keep me out.  You could say that I *was* being pushy/aggressive, but that's sort of my point.  Using social skills to win conflicts comes across as being pushy/aggressive.  I'm interested in alternatives where social skills still have a marked use without coming across this way.</blockquote>\nCool, makes total sense.<br/><br/>How did the Duel of Wits scenes between you and the merchant play out? What were the actions like? How did you get what you want? How was the roleplaying?<br/><br/>It seems, how you roleplay the scene matters quite a bit here. You can have a Duel of Wits where your actions are pleasantries, complements, meeting on common ground, reaching understanding, sweet words, gifts and more. Or you can intimidate, debate, bully, lie, confuse, or generally be aggressive. <br/><br/>If you used pleasantries to win the merchant over, then unless the merchant's attitude towards you was part of the explicit stakes, the merchant player is still in the right to distrust your character rules wise. But it may also just be poor roleplaying and not honoring the fiction (although poor roleplaying is very subjective). It's a very grey area. People can also change their mind as a duel of wits isn't mind control. It's really impossible to fairly comment as it may come down to the nuances of the interactions between players.<br/><br/>That said, it is very possibly a meta concern. If you roll dice at someone, it may be seen as aggressive even if you are trying to be sweet and giving gifts, because on a meta level you are still using force to get what you want. Where offering a fate point or an Apocalypse World XP bribe might be soft enough to alleviate those meta concerns. Essentially using a carrot instead of a stick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319894/#Comment_319894" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T09:09:19+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  9:09AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of the problem should be alleviated through the role-play, right?

I want one thing and you want another. In order for me to change your stance I have to present you with information that you don't have, that makes my stance more acceptable. That's what persuasion is, figuring out what information you don't have and providing it to you. In the end, theres no reason to maintain a grudge because you really do feel differently than you did before considering the information at hand. That has to come out in the role-play...what did you tell the NPC that helped them to agree with you on this issue? It doesn't matter if the scene began and we both believe there's nothing that could change the others stance. The skill role says otherwise, so what was it?<br/><br/>Now obviously if one intimidates or coerces, that should also be be represented in the fiction and of course no one comes away from that situation feeling good about what was done to them. As it should be.<br/><br/>If the system allows for compromise and the results indicate it, obviously after all the information is presented no one is fully convinced but both parties have a better understanding of the others stance. And we've identified some common ground that benefits us both.

Is it a social thing within the group, where you and your opponent just like seeing who can win conflicts and therefore do whatever you can to perpetuate them?  Is it something about that particular situation that called for the merchant to continue to be hostile, like your character's talk with the daughter producing unpleasant consequences for him, or your character's promises and reassurances turning out to be empty?  Is it the type of social skill being used (your character intimidated him or lied to him rather than making a charming, emotional appeal)?  Or is it just some kind of personal thing -- in real life you or the other people in your group avoid social conflicts and tend to see most examples of debate/persuasion as unpleasant and manipulative?<br/><br/>Not that knowing this will necessarily help much with finding an answer, but it at least might narrow down what you're looking for.</blockquote>\nIn this case, its a couple of things.  First, the Burning Wheel rules for Duel of Wits do explicitly say that an individual character's opinion can't be changed, and that stakes should be something concrete and achievable (i.e. "The merchant lets me in to see his daughter" is acceptable, but "The merchant likes me" is not.)  The social skill used was "Persuasion".  <br/><br/>I don't think that social skills in real life are this way.  Rather, it is how the social conflict rules are set up.  I win the conflict by pushing as hard as possible.  The only way to finally win is by making argument points ("Point" maneuver) or possibly even insulting my opponent ("Dismiss" maneuver).  Giving concessions, making promises, or otherwise being nice to my opponent doesn't help me succeed.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Piers</cite><cite>More generally, I think there's a solution in emotions rather than persuasion. So not "I persuade him to do X" but "I want to impress her / make her fall in love with me / enrage him".</cite></blockquote>\nI'm with Graham, here. It feels like both you and the GM were not quite engaging with the system completely in Burning Wheel, in the sense that the future disposition of the opponent in the Duel of Wits was kept off the table--it wasn't your goal, and the GM made changes in attitude without making them part of the compromise.<br/><br/>How would these work as ways of addressing that problem:<br/><br/>1) It is explicitly assumed by everyone that NPC attitudes won't change dramatically (for good or ill) as a result of a Duel of Wits unless that is part of the stakes / compromise.<br/><br/>2) The player and the GM put forward stakes / consequences that explicitly change those attitudes. Eg: "Fine, he'll let you see her right now, but when he thinks it over he won't like it and next time he sees you he'll be really angry."<br/><br/>Putting those in place might make the whole thing more functional, and I'm sure you can adapt them to Fate in similar ways.<br/>In regards to Burning Wheel, the rules say that the Duel of Wits has nothing to say about an individual NPC's attitude - "Remember that these rules don't dictate reality or true feelings.  They only dictate public performance  and acknowledgement of the 'truth.'"  For example, the rules explicitly provide that an NPC can attack if he feels slighted during the duel (the "I Demand Satisfaction" option).  The opinions of an individual can't be stakes by the core rules, but it could be an interesting variant.  <br/><br/>I think the reason why BW has those rules in place, though, is because of the disconnect.  For the role-playing to feel natural, characters should be allowed to react to the events in the conflict.  And further, the conflict by the current rules is all about being pushy.

I believe that I relied mostly on the Point maneuver - it was usually my most effective tactic in shutting out an opponent.  I brought up different reasons why it would be a good idea for the merchant to let me talk to his daughter, and I quickly succeeded with minimal concessions.  (I don't remember if I used Dismiss or not.)  Pleasantries and compliments would probably fit under Obfuscate or Avoid The Topic - although the examples don't mention such.  However, you can't win with just those maneuvers - they are delaying and/or defensive moves.  To win in the end, you need enough successes using Point, Rebuttal, and/or Dismiss to reduce the opponent's Body of Argument down to zero.  <br/><br/>I don't think this was clearly bad role-playing.  By the rules, I think I did indeed come across as pushy.  He disagreed with me, and I made a series of argument points to make him admit that he was wrong and let me in.  However, that's how the rules tell me to use my Persuade skill.  For example, the rules make it so that a good last move to win a Duel of Wits is Dismiss, where you insult your opponent as a fool and a dullard.  <br/><br/>FATE is in some ways even more aggressive.  For social conflicts, Dresden Files is explicit that your moves have to <i>harm</i> your opponent, not just make points in your favor.  You win a social conflict by causing harm until the opponent is taken out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319909/#Comment_319909" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T12:35:12+00:00" title="April 10, 2011 12:35PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But Point doesn't have to be obnoxious.

There's a cognitive dissonance thing at work, where internally they have to justify the fact that they went out on a limb for you by convincing themselves that it was for a good reason. Otherwise, they have to admit that they were duped. This can build up until they're presented with incontrovertible evidence of the fact that they were fooled / coerced / manipulated, and even then they might reject the evidence.<br/><br/>It's how con games work, and also cults. Get someone to do you a little favor, and it becomes easier to get them to do bigger favors for you later. It seems to me this is sort of the opposite of how many games model the interaction. Some games give you a penalty for repeatedly trying to use social skills on the same target, when it should really be a bonus.

See, that's a reasonable point that would serve to wear down his BoA and isn't being an asshat.<br/><br/>It all depends on what was happening. You obviously needed to see her for something. Your points could have all been about giving that info to the merchant and him sympathizing with your plight. If what the character is saying isn't a logical piece of information that would be important to the situation being debated, its probably not really a very good point.</blockquote>\nAn individual point doesn't have to be obnoxious.  Point does have to be aggressive, though, and continued aggression in the face of denials on the opponent's part is usually obnoxious.  <br/><br/>The way the Duel of Wits is set up is this:  I state a position and the opponent states a counter-position.  To invoke the rules, we have to agree on the Stakes.  So I said that I needed to see his daughter to help her with her troubles, but the merchant Hondash was opposed to this.  In order to get to Duel of Wits, we had to establish that we were actually opposed, and from the start I made no secret of why I wanted to see her.  When we didn't agree, we went to Duel of Wits.  During the conflict, roughly, I gave Point after Point of why I should see her, and he gave Point after Point of why he shouldn't let me.  Then I reduced his Body of Argument down to zero, and he had to concede.  <br/><br/>Regardless of how reasonable each Point was, my pushing argument after argument in the face of his denials comes across as obnoxious.  If each side is trying to win the duel, then they will keep giving points in favor of their side.  This usually comes across as obnoxious on both sides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319912/#Comment_319912" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T13:12:46+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  1:12PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, makes total sense.<br/><br/>I've played many versions of Duel of Wits from Burning Wheel, Burning Empires, Blossoms, and Mouse Guard so I suspect they sometimes overlap in my head.

You can use an attack action in a chase or asking for someone's hand in marriage (which was a fun conflict we had in Mouse Guard). Attack is a direct way of trying to get your stakes. So in a chase, where my goal is to get to the finish line first, my attack may just be me running straight forward as fast as I can at any cost. <br/><br/>In Blossoms, you can use Duel of Wits to have Etiquette and Poetry social conflicts! <br/><br/>I don't mean for any of this to contradict what you are saying. I think Point used in the way you describe is a fair interpretation of the basic BW rules. I just want to offer ways we've used different official versions of the rules for non openly aggressive social contests. <br/><br/>That said, even these variations may not solve the issues you describe (maybe they will, it's impossible for me to say without trying it).

It can be rewarding to engage in a contest you know you are going to lose because you will grow quite a bit from it. I especially enjoy knowing I am likely going to lose, being the underdog, but aiming for a compromise. For some players, looking at the opportunities for skill growth in that back and forth can help alleviate some of the tension. But it depends on the person.

I've played lots of Burning Wheel (a year-long campaign and several one-shots) and Mouse Guard (three short campaigns and several one-shots), and one short campaign of Blossoms.  I haven't tried Burning Empires.  For example, I've helped in Poetry social conflicts in Blossoms, and lots of Mouse Guard conflicts.  <br/><br/>As you say, Attack and Point are about directly trying to get the stakes set up at the start of the conflict.  Asking for someone's hand in marriage isn't necessarily aggressive.  However, if they don't immediately accept, and you start giving reason after reason why they should accept - while they give reason after reason why they shouldn't - then it can definitely come across as pushy and/or aggressive.  This has nothing to do with how each reason is phrased, but rather with continuing to push for your original goal in the face of opposition.  In that case, the pushiness might be excused as being from love, but it is still being pushy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319917/#Comment_319917" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T13:55:46+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  1:55PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey John, yeah, I'm clear on how the DoW runs in BW so no worries there.<br/><br/>Perhaps we've strayed from your original design for this thread but I'll continue to comment specifically towards DoW for now. Keep in mind that if either party goes into the DoW knowing that they're just not gonna be comfortable with losing they should either just rework the stakes or simply decline the DoW. If the GM feels like there's just no budging on this issue, he should never have entered the DoW. Your stake for seeing the girl is simply unacceptable.<br/><br/>And Point, Point, Point is fine and I still don't see why it necessarily has to be obnoxious. If you're goals are to help his child and he's just being protective, that argument can exist on peaceful terms. As long as you're providing Points that actually make sense towards the welfare of the child and everyone at the table sees that, there's no reason that the fiction can't conclude with the father saying "Dammit, you're right....please forgive my gruffness but I worry. I welcome your assistance." It makes no sense for you to win the argument and for the merchant to actually let you in his house but to be pissed off about it. The character had to have said something that makes the result reasonable. <br/><br/>By even acknowledging a social mechanic you as players are entering a contract that says, "Yes, we agree that its possible to talk people into doing things they don't originally agree with and we'll strive to make the fiction portray how that happens in a logical fashion." When the mechanics say it happens, make it make sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319920/#Comment_319920" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T14:25:37+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  2:25PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I havent played BW, but it seems to me that dueling with wits is a poor choice of tactic to convince a father about his daughter.

Or Dismissing his concerns with "So we agree, then; you don't have to worry about me upsetting your daughter.  Thank you for letting me in to ask these few, brief questions, it helps a lot."  Or something along those lines, just basically making it sound more like you're mediating than debating, even though you're still doing a DoW.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>FATE is in some ways even more aggressive.  For social conflicts, Dresden Files is explicit that your moves have to <i>harm</i> your opponent, not just make points in your favor.  You win a social conflict by causing harm until the opponent is taken out.</blockquote>\nThere's definitely a lot of room in FATE to recast a social conflict in less aggressive ways, though; taking social or mental stress is a bummer, but depending on what conditions you apply, the actual harm done during the conflict can sound fairly mild.  "Willing to consider someone else's opinions," "newfound respect for life," "guilty conscience," etc..  And in practice, social conflicts in our group never went very far, because one side could always concede the argument before things went too far.  A social conflict that ended with one character taking the "filled with regret" condition felt different from one where the character left with "too frustrated to think straight," and led to very different kinds of interactions later on.  In the former, it was a very empathy-laden social conflict with dialogue about self-reflection and poignant personal revelations; in the latter it was a straight-up argument with aggressively-deployed sarcasm.  That's one advantage of how loosely FATE defines conflicts, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319931/#Comment_319931" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T16:59:22+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  4:59PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/stefoid-Well">@stefoid-Well</a>, DoW is just the game mechanic for resolving differences of opinion and moving the game forward.

By aggressive, I mean what in real life is called "not taking no for an answer."  For example, an aggressive seduction might mean that after a guy politely tells me he's not interested, my character keep trying at him until he says yes.  This is an issue in social conflict rules in that the skill rolls don't kick in until there are definite opposed positions.  i.e. If he is flirting with me and I'm flirting with him, there isn't any clear conflict so we don't go to the conflict rules.  He has to say no for there to be conflict.  At that point, my character will seem aggressive.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>To win in the end, you need enough successes using Point, Rebuttal, and/or Dismiss to reduce the opponent's Body of Argument down to zero.</blockquote>\nNot being familiar with BW, I'm curious:  are Point, Rebuttal, and Dismiss always defined as aggressive, pushy statements ("Therefore, you are an idiot; now shut up!"), or are they just generic handwavy words to describe "a statement of my position," "a problem with your position," and "a statement that your position can no longer be held"?<br/><br/>Because if it's the latter, I'm wondering if you can defuse some of the pushy aggressiveness of a Duel of Wits by adding some extra color.

That is the description of the maneuver given in the rules.  So it goes beyond pushy into being insulting.  Point is more generically defined, but just because it isn't insulting doesn't mean that it doesn't come off as pushy.  The definition of a point is that you are presenting an argument for your original position.  Further, your opponent is going to be doing the same - presenting an argument for his original position (i.e. the Stakes of the conflict).  Regardless of how each one is phrased, if I keep meeting my opponent's denials with insistence on the same position, that comes across as pushy.  <br/><br/>In the example I gave, I might ask nicely to come in like you say, and the merchant tells me no.  At this point, we establish that we have a conflict.  As my opening move, I politely bring up a good reason for me to come in, and he again denies and makes a point against my seeing his daughter.  I again make a politely-phrased request for the same thing, and he again denies the request and pushes his position that I am not to see her.  If this were happening in real life, I would be coming across as pushy.  In other words, I'm not taking no for an answer.  It's not that any individual request is insulting, it is that I keep insisting on my original position.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>There's definitely a lot of room in FATE to recast a social conflict in less aggressive ways, though; taking social or mental stress is a bummer, but depending on what conditions you apply, the actual harm done during the conflict can sound fairly mild.  "Willing to consider someone else's opinions," "newfound respect for life," "guilty conscience," etc..  And in practice, social conflicts in our group never went very far, because one side could always concede the argument before things went too far.  A social conflict that ended with one character taking the "filled with regret" condition felt different from one where the character left with "too frustrated to think straight," and led to very different kinds of interactions later on.  In the former, it was a very empathy-laden social conflict with dialogue about self-reflection and poignant personal revelations; in the latter it was a straight-up argument with aggressively-deployed sarcasm.  That's one advantage of how loosely FATE defines conflicts, I think.</blockquote>\nWell, Dresden Files explicitly defines an attack as doing harm to an opponent.  An opponent can choose to take a consequence in different ways, but when I define an attack it has to be something that will work towards taking the opponent out.  It seems rather tricky to stick to this and yet have the attack not come across as at least pushy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319936/#Comment_319936" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T17:56:41+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  5:56PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, would it feel less pushy or obnoxious if, when you scripted an unopposed Point and you reduced their Body of Argument by some number that they reacted more appropriately?

If you get a good hit, then the opponent considers that a powerful, good point in your favor - but he keeps arguing for his original position.  In the end, if I win, the opponent acknowledges that I have made a solid case.  <br/><br/>Especially for those new to Duel of Wits, I think it works pretty well for its intended purpose.  Two people have defined, mutually-opposed positions - and they publicly debate about that until one concedes the other's point.  I think that this is perfectly realistic.  If someone makes a cogent, well-reasoned argument then the other may well acknowledge that their point is better than their own.  However, that doesn't make them *like* the arguer, and they may well consider the winner pushy.  I remember well the poetry duel in Blossoms Are Falling, where one monk pointedly outshone another in public recital.  <br/><br/>Rather than trying to "fix" Duel of Wits - which works fine for its purpose - I'd like to have more options where high social skill is concretely, mechanically useful without it coming across as being pushy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319944/#Comment_319944" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T19:36:01+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  7:36PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, I'm really not understanding how this is necessarily a game design issue. Doesn't whether or not your use of social skill is pushy depend entirely on the specifics of use and the initial disposition of the person it is being used upon? <br/><br/>Honestly it sounds entirely like a roleplaying issue to me and I don't see any particular social mechanic being able to keep players or the GM from having characters act resentful. Assuming I'm just being dense though I'll try and give some helpful suggestions.<br/><br/>One thing I would do is make a "no" actually mean no. Once a character/npc has stated their position as being directly opposed to yours than no nice form of social maneuvering can work. You have to resort to intimidation, blackmail, etc. So you have to actively, knowingly, resort to being pushy at that stage. Then any resentment would be well earned. This makes the more pleasant social skills actually be for winning and keeping allies, as opposed to using leverage to manipulate your enemies.<br/><br/>In order to change a "no" into a "maybe" and give you a chance to work your social skills again you might have to perform some act that would make an impression and give you an opening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319950/#Comment_319950" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T20:11:05+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  8:11PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>I think there may be some miscommunication about what is meant by "aggressive".  By aggressive, I mean what in real life is called "not taking no for an answer."  For example, an aggressive seduction might mean that after a guy politely tells me he's not interested, my character keep trying at him until he says yes.  This is an issue in social conflict rules in that the skill rolls don't kick in until there are definite opposed positions.  i.e. If he is flirting with me and I'm flirting with him, there isn't any clear conflict so we don't go to the conflict rules.  He has to say no for there to be conflict.  At that point, my character will seem aggressive.</blockquote>\nI've definitely seen this happen quite a bit. I see two great points here.<br/><br/>I just want to restate (hopefully correctly) what John is saying above...<br/><br/>1.<br/><br/>If character 1 says "do this" and character 2 says "no" but then character 1 keeps repeating "do this" again and again till character 2 says "yes", it's going to come off as really aggressive. Imagine Kathy proposes marriage to Bob and Bob says no. Then Kathy keeps trying different tactics to get Bob to say yes, no matter how subtle those tactics are... it's pushy. <br/><br/>2. <br/><br/>Many conflict rules aren't used till one side says no. We don't know if it is a conflict till there is clear opposition. But once there is clear opposition followed by pressure to change... it is hard not to come off as pushy. <br/><br/>In addition to the above, here is my own actual play observation...<br/><br/>An NPC saying no to a PC is very different than 1 PC saying no to another. As a GM, my NPCs only exist to make the PCs lives interesting and make their story worth telling. I have no ventured interest in an NPC getting their way. I just want to create exciting situations for everyone involved. So when I have an NPC say "no", I don't actually care what happens either way. As a GM, I'm not invested in my fictional characters the same way players are invested in player characters. When I say "no" as a GM, what I'm really saying, "I think it would be really entertaining to make this a conflict." I'm not actually saying "no." <br/><br/>BUT when a PC says "no" to another PC, often no actually means no. Or, "I don't want my character to do this but if it is going to be an issue, then lets make it a mechanical conflict." And then even though they agreed to go to mechanics, there investment means there is going to be a certain amount of tension that could cause issues in how that conflict is roleplayed out and how the characters interact later on. <br/><br/>So how do we deal with the above? <br/><br/>We have a few ways. I will make a separate post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319952/#Comment_319952" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T20:21:00+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  8:21PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2011 8:23PM by Chris McNeilly.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Commenting on your 1 above jenskot:<br/><br/>I agree that is being pushy and obnoxious.

But it's my feeling that that is NOT what is taking place under a successful Persuasion check, or whatever, in the game. That may be a failed check. A successful check means we both start off in disagreement but one character manages to present information that is actually meaningful to the target. And that information is significant enough that it either changes the targets initial stance or at least makes them sympathetic to the persuaders point of view.<br/><br/>After all, if we're even agreeing that Persuasion is appropriate, we have to be saying, "Hey, they don't agree with you right now but it's reasonable to believe that you could say SOMETHING that would change the way they see the situation."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319953/#Comment_319953" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T20:40:33+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  8:40PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Im interested in this because my game also employs 'social conflict' where you reduce your opponents will to win, like hit-points in physical conflict.  And in an effort to make the outcomes less black and white '<i>you get your way 100% or you dont</i>" I have introduced 'concessions', which is if you make a hit on your opponent, they will concede part of your outcome.  "Y<i>ou cannot talk to my daughter, but I will pass on a message...</i>"<br/><br/>Currently, the rules allow 4 such rounds of conflict (any more is ridiculous circular argument).  But still, for the successive three rounds, you can continue to put forward your position, and if you dont totally get your way by the end of the time-limit, you may at least win further concessions.  <br/><br/>But perhaps that should be tweaked, Im thinking because of this thread.  Like, if you continue to put forward your case, even after being granted a concession, then that is pushy, regardless of how charming or otherwise you are.  I think you should be risking concessions gained if you do that.  <br/><br/>example:  trying to seduce someone.  Perhaps in the first round you win, and gain a concession - some kissing.  At this point, you can accept you got some kissing and leave it there, or continue to advance your cause and risk a slap in the face?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319955/#Comment_319955" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T20:50:00+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  8:50PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is how I avoid these issues in Mouse Guard (when they are actually problems, which depends on the players)\u2026<br/><br/>1. Characters in an extended conflict can't say "give me what I want" followed by "no" repeatedly. <br/><br/>Imagine it was a fight, not a social conflict. Imagine someone kept narrating, "I chop your head off" followed by "no you don't." We avoid, "I kill you." That's what the end of the conflict is for. The same is true for social conflicts. You can't say the equivalent of "no, I absolutely won't give you what you want." We don't know if you are going to say "no" yet till the end of the conflict. Instead the body of a conflict is people trying to actually persuade each other. Tell us why it is or isn't a good idea. Don't narrate each action as if it is the end of the conflict when it isn't. Otherwise it feels like ramming head first into a brick wall. <br/><br/>We also sometimes agree that we can't repeat ourselves in an extended conflict.<br/><br/>2. Instead of someone saying "no" to start a conflict between player characters, we say "would it be interesting if this was a conflict?" If character 1 says "do this", character 2 says "convince me" instead of "no". And if someone really does want to say "no", then no actually means no.

Of course repeatedly going back to an already concluded argument would be considered obnoxious. But I don't think that's what we're discussing. For example, BW doesn't revisit the argument. You have one debate that lasts over several rounds of giving evidence. The argument then concludes, one time, and you don't revisit it. As a matter of fact, you CAN'T revisit. The conclusion is binding. <br/><br/>I would assume that most social skill conflicts would be handled similarly. Once you have the outcome, that's it. Final answer.<br/><br/>Edit: That may have sounded snooty, sorry. Didnt mean it that way. Just saying that I've been working under the wrong assumption if Johns primary complaint is about repeatedly trying old arguments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319966/#Comment_319966" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T21:51:45+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  9:51PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not repeating the same argument, but simply persisting in the conflict.

Is persuading someone to do something dramatic?  Is eking out a bargain with someone with concessions on both sides dramatic?<br/><br/>Obviously the context of what is riding on the persuasion or bargain attempt lends weight to dramatic potential of social conflict, but often there are other types of social interaction/conflict that isnt so much about characters getting what they want (characters overtly seeking goals) but about 'revelation, realization, etc...'  Often people get into emotional arguments with no conscious realization of what they are actually arguing with each other about, or why.  The type of argument that starts off with 'you left the toilet seat up', and ends with 'Ive been having an affair for the last 3 months and Im leaving you'.<br/><br/>How do you model that type of social conflict?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319973/#Comment_319973" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T22:59:55+00:00" title="April 10, 2011 10:59PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>This is how I avoid these issues in Mouse Guard (when they are actually problems, which depends on the players)\u2026<br/><br/>1. Characters in an extended conflict can't say "give me what I want" followed by "no" repeatedly.<br/><br/>Imagine it was a fight, not a social conflict. Imagine someone kept narrating, "I chop your head off" followed by "no you don't." We avoid, "I kill you." That's what the end of the conflict is for. The same is true for social conflicts. You can't say the equivalent of "no, I absolutely won't give you what you want." We don't know if you are going to say "no" yet till the end of the conflict. Instead the body of a conflict is people trying to actually persuade each other. Tell us why it is or isn't a good idea. Don't narrate each action as if it is the end of the conflict when it isn't. Otherwise it feels like ramming head first into a brick wall.</blockquote>\nRight.  I agree with this, and this matches what I do.  Each move needs to be different.  <br/><br/>However, moves have to push towards winning your defined side of the argument.  When it's your turn in the conflict, you can't say "no" absolutely, but you also can't say "yes".  So you need to respond to "here's why we should do what I want" with "OK, but here's why we should do what *I* want".  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>2. Instead of someone saying "no" to start a conflict between player characters, we say "would it be interesting if this was a conflict?" If character 1 says "do this", character 2 says "convince me" instead of "no". And if someone really does want to say "no", then no actually means no. Or, "I'm not comfortable with this conflict."</blockquote>\nThis seems tricky to me.  If someone only says "convince me", then they aren't taking an active role.  If they passively listen and try to be convinced, then there isn't a conflict - just an extended task.  In a conflict, the opponent has to take active moves to push their side of the argument.  i.e. They have to make Points (in Duel of Wits) or Attacks back against the one who started the conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319983/#Comment_319983" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-11T01:58:37+00:00" title="April 11, 2011  1:58AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems that people are arguing past each other here (ironic for a thread on clear communication). <br/><br/>For the "visiting the merchant's daughter" situation, it seems to me that there are two ways of resolving the issue.<br/><br/>One is to make the merchant agree to let the PC see his daughter, whatever he feels about it.<br/><br/>The other is to make the merchant feel that the PC seeing his daughter is a good thing, whatever he does about it.<br/><br/>The first is often handled with a skill called "Fast Talk"; it's about actions taken, not changes in emotions or attitudes.<br/><br/>The second is often handled with a skill called "Oratory"; it's about attitudes and emotions, not the actions taken.<br/><br/>The BW DoW explicitly only does the former type of interaction. In the merchant's daughter example, I think that John is more interested in effecting the latter change.<br/><br/>Seen in that light, is another way of stating (part of) the OP a request for mechanical support for making changes to characters' emotions, attitudes and perhaps even goals?<br/><br/>If so, there are some models for how to do it, generally involving mechanical carrots, not sticks. Mentioned upthread were examples from AW where characters gain benefits for following the advice of others. In FATE, you could imagine Henry V making a Leadership test to give his troops the Aspect "Once More Unto the Breach", which they can self-compel for fate points when renewing an attack. <br/><br/>As for teams working together, the GoO Tekumel game had the Teamwork skill.

In most circumstances where social manipulation is involved, if you ever get a point where the other guy says 'no' and you have to say 'yes', you've already failed. There certainly is a kind of socially adept person who is all about getting to that point and then still badgering/arguing his way to victory, but that will only really fly in certain circles that accept a level of argumentativeness as standard social procedure (eg. politics, academia, internet forums.)<br/><br/>But there is a whole subsection of social ability that really has to do with never appearing to be in conflict with anyone, even as you get what you want; and with, in fact, arranging things socially so that everyone involved feels like they are getting what they want. A very charismatic person tends to win people over as part of their natural demeanor, not by reaching a point of stark opposition and then confronting the people with the inferiority of their position.<br/><br/>So really the problem seems to be about at what point in the fiction you engage the mechanics; the players need to perceive a kind of soft-edged conflict of interests prior to it becoming a conflict that is so obvious that even the characters involved realise it is a conflict. And the system needs to deliver on ways for a proactive, socially adept character to stake out their position long before everyone else involves understands that that is what is happening. Improving someone's general impression of you to the point that they are reluctant to engage in social confrontation, for example.<br/><br/>For me, the Duel of Wits has always worked in the fiction by being strictly limited to public-facing arguments; the assumption of an audience (and the inferred admission, by both parties, that this audience holds sufficient power to sway their actions) makes the interaction easier to understand. It also allows for characters to be 'convinced' to take an action that they are not actually personally convinced is the best one; they take it because they perceive the audience to be so far in favor of it that not taking it would damage their reputation, which is a worse outcome than taking the 'wrong' action.<br/><br/>The fact that lots of people are perceiving this as a "it's roleplaying" problem suggests to me that Burning Wheel just doesn't model the part of social interaction that jhkim was talking about, not that it actually models it fine if you just interpolate a whole layer of roleplaying on top of the mechanics. Personally I'm a lot more interested in thinking of ways to model this than going over the many ways in which the Duel of Wits does not. I like the idea put forward of how to do this in FATE*, where you could use maneuvers to basically put conditions on people like 'I like PC X!' or 'PC X has my best interests at heart' -- these conditions could then serve as guidelines to players in terms of setting a mechanical threshhold for social opposition. As in, if you have +4 worth of Aspects of the basically-I-like-this-guy sort, then you can think 'does this social conflict matter enough that I am willing to pony up 2 FATE straight off the bat, just to get it started?' These would be guidelines for the <i>players</i> as to their character's mostly-subconscious social behaviours.<br/><br/>Similarly, Aspects such as those outlined above could also do double duty for modelling how a socially successful leader can help groups work together, since you could also tap/activate/whatever the Aspect in circumstances where you were acting to help That Guy You Really Like, or whatever.<br/><br/>Again though, this is going to rely on players cultivating a new skill or a new appreciation of when to 'go to dice' -- because you do it before a conflict, or before what we traditionally recognize as 'conflict.' It's kind of like a 'conflict mitigation' stage; and I think a lot of us have spent a lot of time trying to avoid a very similar social behaviour at our tables, where someone who is more socially adept manipulates the story through 'good roleplaying' so as to avoid any conflicts that are bad for his character. The solution to that has generally been to push to conflict, and therefore to dice, sooner -- so that this maneuvering can happen only as part of the mechanical conflict, limiting any social advantage a player may be wielding over the table -- but it may turn out that by doing so we have also cut out a significant opportunity for the <i>characters</i> to exercise a similar sort of in-fiction social maneuvering which is actually completely appropriate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>* My god did I just say I thought FATE was good at doing something?

Just pure discussion/persuasiveness. Furthermore, is it possible to achieve with both parties remaining respectful to one another at the conclusion?<br/><br/>If your answer is "No", then obviously there's going to be a problem with trying to model such an exchange with any game mechanic. If your answer is Yes, then it should be pretty easy to do with any type of resolution system.<br/><br/>If the answer is "Yes, Sometimes" then it gets sticky as we have to somehow figure out how to even decide if we're in one of those situations where its appropriate. If I go into the situation thinking "It doesn't make sense for this person to be persuaded" and you go thinking "Yeah, this is reasonable and here's why" then we're much more likely to come out on the other side with discomfort over the resolution.<br/><br/>My whole point throughout this discussion has been that if you're playing a game that has a social mechanic for conflict resolution (even something as simple as Roll vs. Willpower or something similar) AND you've decided to utilize that mechanic...then everyone at the table has already bought into the situation with a resounding "Yes".  <br/><br/>[My thoughts on Burning Wheel (skip this if you're not interested in BW specifically, I feel like the BW portion of this discussion is actually pretty peripheral to the real thrust of the discussion):<br/><br/>Ice Cream Emperor has thrown out some real nuggets of gold. BW's Duel of Wits really is best suited for debates that have an audience that is significant to the discussion. Public debate. That's where the "You win, but I still disagree" philosophy really does make sense. For me, that outcome is very incongrous with a one on one discussion where the "audience" is the two characters talking.<br/><br/>I find it much more fulfilling to assume in one on one situations that the outcome really does change the mind of the participants. That's why declining the duel should always be an option. Duel of Wits is not mind control, but I'm pretty sure the rules specifically say that it does not preclude the possibility of mind change.<br/><br/>Duel of Wits is a weird beast though to base this discussion on because its a bit schizophrenic in some ways. Its operating on two levels, Player vs. Player and Character vs. Character. Sometimes it can be about convincing someone in the fiction and sometimes its only about Players coming to an agreement and moving forward. There's also the public versus private split and what a conclusion means in those two environments.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319990/#Comment_319990" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-11T06:30:16+00:00" title="April 11, 2011  6:30AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2011 6:35AM by jenskot.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>2.

My apologies.<br/><br/>Saying, "would it be interesting if this was a conflict?"or "convince me" isn't being passive. It's a meta, out of character method, to signal the start of a conflict. It removes the pushiness you described earlier when you start conflicts by saying "no". Once you start the conflict, you don't have to be passive. <br/><br/>Kathy -- "Will you marry me?"<br/>Bob's Player -- I think it would be awesome to make this a conflict.<br/>Kathy's Player -- I agree, let's do this!<br/>Bob -- "Will I marry you?" ::hesitates and looks unsure:: <br/>Kathy's Stakes -- Bob will marry me.<br/>Bob's Stakes -- Kathy will promise to leave her job where she is overworked.<br/>Kathy's Attack -- "Bob, we've been a happy loving couple for 10 years... I can't think of any reason we shouldn't get married."<br/>Bob's Defense -- "I do love you, but what will marriage prove? We don't need to be married to prove we love each other."<br/>Bab's Attack -- "And I love spending time with you... when I see you... but you already seem married... to your job!"<br/><br/>If this was Mouse Guard, it would be easy to continue to model this conversation using Maneuvers and Feints while never appearing aggressively pushy.<br/><br/>And if Bob started with, "no... I won't marry you" and Kathy kept pushing him to change his mind... that would be pushy. Starting the conflict with "no" already creates an aggressive situation.<br/><br/>But even better... if Bob's Player actually means no as in... "no, I don't feel comfortable making this a conflict" it creates a clear opening for them to be honest immediately without starting a conflict people feel weird about later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Social skill that isn't obnoxious aggression - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14121/social-skill-that-isnt-obnoxious-aggression/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Social skill that isn't obnoxious aggression - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14121/social-skill-that-isnt-obnoxious-aggression/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content='I adore the original post.

original post.  <br/><br/>The 4 "scattered thoughts about an alternate system"...  ARE an alternate system.<br/><br/>The 4 points are so succinctly-stated and persuasive, that simply reciting any of them at the table verbatim-- is likely to win-over other players, <br/>with a minimum of meta-fuss.<br/><br/><br/>I am reminded of a con game last fall, where my input tended to be broad and cartoonish.<br/><br/>A couple other players had a more nuanced take on the relationship between a step-father and step-son-- who shared little affinity for each other.<br/><br/>One of the other players told me bluntly to back-off and give the other player a chance to enact what he was envisioning.<br/><br/>And, because the other player was truly gifted as an actor, he did immediately demonstrate what he was going-for.<br/><br/><br/>As others have said above, this solution relied on the player's skill to convince me.<br/><br/>What I'm saying now is-- a less-skilled player could have similar results against me if they come armed with John Kim's 4 points, and use them<br/>as arguments in favor of handling outcomes that-way, when these issues arise.<br/><br/>I don't believe the issue is 'too much emphasis on conflict', but rather a lack of grasping that conflict is nuanced.  John's points are the antidote.<br/><br/>Trying to shoehorn John's points into workable <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=579" rel="nofollow">procedural cues and mediating cues</a> will, <br/>if successful, make you Vincent Baker's equal.   But, if you miss the mark, you'll have written a confounding ruleset, in which I can't <br/>grasp why you're making me do various mechanical gymnastics...         tons of games fall into this category.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319999/#Comment_319999" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-11T07:54:28+00:00" title="April 11, 2011  7:54AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys, I've really enjoyed the discussion but I know now that I've really misinterpreted what it's about and that's been detrimental to what John wanted to do here.

This is super-super common for my new players coming in from other RPGs, especially ones that never addressed social fighting. If all you have is a hammer the whole world is nails, and all that.<br/><br/>I think, also, that DoW reflects BW/Luke's general attitude toward conflict. I think the game is built around framing up strong confrontation, and I do think that that's a reflection of the creator and his aesthetic. So, yeah, there's also that.<br/><br/>We've run DoWs that were straight-up seduction, careful nuanced negotiations, red-faced screaming matches, two friends deciding on which fork in their lives to take.<br/><br/>My personal protip for players who want more out of their DoWs: make the contents of each volley count in the fiction. You're not just rolling an action, you're saying something of real importance and then rolling to see what that statement did to the other guy's will to fight. Sword blows are all same-same in combat because the only goal that matters is killing the other guy. But in a DoW, it <i>matters</i> that you insulted my parentage, or that I've promised you coin in return for your loyalty (not knowing that you will view the bribery as an affront to you honor).<br/><br/>Make those things show up in the compromise and in the roleplaying afterward. Don't forget what was actually said during the Duel, just because you rolled dice for mechanical effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320007/#Comment_320007" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-11T09:16:28+00:00" title="April 11, 2011  9:16AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I will admit to not reading the entire thread; I skimmed some of it because it was a bit TL.  However, two important mechanical things:<br/><br/>1) RAW, you shouldn't be engaging in a DoW to convince your *opponent in the Duel* of anything.  It's supposed to be two people competing with each other to convince a 3rd person of something.  Seriously, I just checked the rules, that's what it says.  p. 96<br/><br/>2) You can't use Persuasion on a Dismiss.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320045/#Comment_320045" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-11T13:15:56+00:00" title="April 11, 2011  1:15PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of this does seem specific to the DoW mechanic, since it's the only social-y mechanic in BW.  It has the disadvantage of requiring at least a couple of rolls.  I wonder if you could cut down on the perceived aggressiveness by:<br/>1. collapsing something relatively small like this into a single skill check.  Then you don't have to roleplay a series of "pushy" moves to convince the other side.<br/>2. using much smaller points.  I knock politely.  I look concerned.  I hold my hat in my hand and look down.  This cuts down on the pushi-ness (if you want to roleplay it that way.)<br/>3. using more sympathetic points.  I know she's important to you.  I'm worried about what might happen.  I'm trying to help a friend of yours.  This can cut down on the eventual feeling of resentment.<br/>I think a lot of it comes down to a constraint of the DoW rules, though.  Which aren't really intended to change your opponents mind (as Matt points out.)<br/><br/>I do think Fate does a cleaner job of this.

Paying more attention to what is being said in the fiction and then using the dice to see what sort of an impact it has can definitely add dimension to any social conflict, but I don't really think it addresses the original issue. Especially since as far as I remember, DoW has no built-in ability to concede, unlike DitV -- though possibly it has this explicitly in the rules and it just gets overshadowed by all the other bits.<br/><br/>Either way I think there is still a gap in most rulesets for the kind of social interaction jhkim is talking about, and the kind of socially successful/adept character he has in mind.<br/><br/><br/>* An implicit audience is what can make 'two people talking in private' Duels of Wits effective even with a straightforward take. Most of us operate in our lives with an implied audience; we observe our own actions and opinions from the outside even as we take them, etc. Also, if the person you are 'arguing' with is someone you respect, they themselves serve as an audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320155/#Comment_320155" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T12:42:13+00:00" title="April 12, 2011 12:42PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cy</cite>I do think Fate does a cleaner job of this.

Because okay, if Bob has put an Aspect on me -- 'Bob is my Friend', that's one thing. But if we're arguing about who gets to ask the pretty girl at the counter out to the movies, and his very first move is to pull in that Aspect -- 'I thought you were my Friend!' -- that says something about everybody involved. In the same way that if I have all these aspects stacked on me and I still decide to oppose Bob socially -- let's say, on a slightly more serious matter like whether or not to torture a captured spy -- then that says something about how important that argument is for me. But it still puts me at a disadvantage if Bob gets to bring in 'Bob is my Friend', 'Bob set me up with my current wife' and 'Bob is really smart, he knows more than me about everything.'  All the sort of social 'advantages' one can build up over the course of mid-to-long-term social relationships.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320224/#Comment_320224" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T21:11:17+00:00" title="April 12, 2011  9:11PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can concede in DoW's.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320227/#Comment_320227" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T23:05:41+00:00" title="April 12, 2011 11:05PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, you're usually going to only have one long-term aspect related to a person.

Which is a handy way of saying how important this is to your character.<br/><br/>For NPCs, these aspects will usually be short-term, put on by maneuvers (or possibly previous Consequences.)  The equivalent of damaging points without actually causing stress.  They just tilt the playing field towards you until it's clear they're going to fall eventually.  It might be nice if something like Pacifism had a bit more mechanical weight without FP backing it up.  Btu I'd probably give some a FP for Pacifism if they forced a social conflict to Stress them out when conceding would clearly be the "right" move.<br/><br/>There's always this balance between social skills being Mind Control and just pressure.

Play to get the father to accept you and play to agree upon his terms. See? It's totally possible to play a DoW not coming off as a totally egocentric bastard that only can see one side of things.<br/><br/>But the thing is, if you just want to be charming and gentle and good, why not just give the father what he wanted in the first place?

In general, I feel this is getting too much tied up in particular conflicts and especially in the one example of the merchant's daughter.  If people could bring up some alternate examples of social conflict as well as other social skill use, that would be great.  <br/><br/>There was a good point that social skill hasn't helped much with allies since AD&amp;D's Charisma.  Spirit of the Century lets you take minions, but that requires a special stunt - it isn't a function of your regular Leadership skill.  As a side note, social skill isn't necessarily about being nice.  A character could be manipulative and scheming and not nice at all and yet be socially skilled.  The point is that they shouldn't <i>come across</i> as pushy or aggressive - especially at first glance.  There are a lot of different kinds of social skill.  For example, there could be a fanatical leader who does come across as aggressive and rarely gets anywhere socially with people not in his camp, but who inspires great loyalty in those who are with him.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Doug Bonar</cite>Late to the thread, but one thought doesn't seem to have shown up.<br/><br/>Maybe you are going to the mechanics too late.

It seems like with some social skill should kick in *before* it gets to the point where there is a definite conflict.  The way it is played in some games, a socially-unskilled character and a socially-skilled character are both identical until the point that there is a definite conflict.  It seems like social skill should kick in earlier to head off conflict.  However, that goes against the usual grain of some conflict resolution systems.  It's important not to look with hindsight.  We don't necessarily know what the conflict will be.  For example, maybe the merchant will be OK with letting me in, but wants to stay and speak for his daughter rather than letting me talk to her alone and candidly.  If we're engaging before the clear conflict, then we can't act as if we know exactly what the conflict is.  <br/><br/>I'd like to suggest more the idea about having lack of social skill create conflict.  I have in real life often seen people argue and get angry at each other even though it turns out they had no substantial disagreement over anything.  They just misread what the other was saying, then got annoyed about how they were reacting.  This is tricky to run as mechanical conflict resolution because there aren't clearly agreed stakes, at least from the characters' points of view.  Still, I'd like to see more problems arise from low social skill.

It strikes me a little bit like like 'random encounters' that happen from time to time in some games, whilst traveling from point A to point B.  <br/><br/>"Grog is buying a length of rope from a merchant, lets turn it into a conflict because Grog has poor social skills."  That kind of thing?<br/><br/>I figure if Grog is involved in a social situation where there is already something significant at stake, then its already a conflict in the broad sense of the term.  Thats where Grogs poor social skills can kick in screw things up worse.  Poor social skills shouldn't be the only reason for the conflict, is what Im trying to say.  You could narrate colorful poor social skills whenever you like anyway - "Grog goes down to the market to buy some rope and comes back with a black eye and no rope -- anyway, back to the story...."    But otherwise there would have to be something else at stake - maybe Grog is a wanted outlaw and there are guards at the market that might be drawn to a commotion and recognize him.  That kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320600/#Comment_320600" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T14:34:42+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  2:34PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot of breadth in "lack of social skills."

You're implying that the conflict was one-on-one and that the stakes were that I changed the merchant's mind, but I was already explicit that this wasn't the case in post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2316&amp;Mode=like">#16</a>.  The duel was not one-on-one, and it did not change the merchant's true state of mind.  Indeed, that was my big point here - that the merchant later acted annoyed that he had been forced to admit my argument was stronger.  My social skill let me win arguments, but my character tended to be resented rather than liked later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320642/#Comment_320642" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T19:36:16+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  7:36PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You were still trying to get *your opponent in the duel* to do something for you/allow you to do something!<br/><br/>If you follow the RAW, your opponent may not like you afterwards, but at least the target of the duel, the audience, will likely be charmed or think better of you.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320676/#Comment_320676" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T23:13:40+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 11:13PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>You were still trying to get *your opponent in the duel* to do something for you/allow you to do something!<br/><br/>If you follow the RAW, your opponent may not like you afterwards, but at least the target of the duel, the audience, will likely be charmed or think better of you.</blockquote>\np96 "Though the Duel of Wits cannot make a character like or believe something, it can force him to agree to something - even for the time being."<br/><br/>p104 "A Duel of Wits is over when one party's body of argument is reduced to zero.

In my Spirit of the Century campaign, I felt like Empathy wasn't as useful as it might be - but the details are hazy in my mind right now.  <br/><br/>Besides these, I'm pondering about how - assuming cooperative players - a PC group with a good set of social skills should be more effective than a PC group with all low social skills.  <br/><br/>Another issue is: how should we represent skill value in establishing trust?

The stakes can't be mutually contradictory, and they can all end up succeeding (or failing.)  Something like:<br/>\nOne player gets to pose a Stake their character wants.<br/>\nIn turn, each other player can add a new Stake.  It must be possible for these stakes to succeed or fail independently from previous Stakes.<br/>\nOnce everyone has had a turn, players can spend some sort of resource, or take a penalty, or maybe just without cost propose more stakes in turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you've got a bunch of compatible stakes on the table.<br/>\nEveryone makes a social skill check.<br/>\nThe winner of the check rolls one d6 per stake on the table, and assigns one to each stake.

The system tells you your character is now ANGRY, so what do you do with that? Your character is now FRIENDLY. And so on.<br><br>You might see strategies like "provoke" or "charm". Provoke might be used to manipulate someone's disposition toward you downward and charm, vice-versa.<br><br>I think it might be very interesting to have a player who wants, at the authorial player level, to get some chieftain to join his character's cause but because his disposition toward you is ANGRY, your first goal is to charm him, not to force him, so that the chieftain's player is obligated to frame their points in friendlier terms.<br><br>BW sorta-kinda has this approach very lightly sprinkled into its social conflict system via "soothing platitudes" and "poisonous platitudes" skills, which the player is obligated to play toward.

I think its perfectly reasonable for a character to want to get another character to like, hate, appreciate them, etc...   I also think its perfectly reasonable for a character to want that at the same time as trying to achieve something else.  Im doing it right now, I want to convince you of my point of view and I want you to like me or at least not think Im obnoxious and pushy.  How am I doing?

The GM has a responsibility to water down unreasonable expectations like getting someone to instantly fall in love with you, or divulge top secrets or something at the drop of a hat.  that sort of thing should be the target of a long campaign of social activity, if at all.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343454/#Comment_343454" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T04:13:37+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  4:13AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2011 4:16AM by stefoid.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            necro:<br><br> jhkims original post is a good one, and I have been struggling with rules for challenging social situations as well.

I don't have a complete system yet, just some scattered thoughts about an alternate system:<br/>1) In the big picture, social skills should be used more for winning and keeping allies than for defeating enemies.<br/>2) A group with socially skilled characters should be more effective as a whole than one without.  Social skills aren't just about making other people obey you - they can help you and others work together.<br/>3) Social skill rolls should be required for social interaction - not just an option.  Characters with low social skill should be the cause of conflict, not just bystanders or weak combatants if there is conflict.<br/>4) Social interaction isn't just about getting your way - it can also be about communication.  Two people might be in conflict because of lack of social skill, because they don't realize their common ground.</blockquote>Your analysis is very good!<br/><br/>Here is what I do in my frpg <i>Fabula</i> ...<br/><br/>The social skill is a broad tradition-skill, and does this; <br/>- it tells how to make birthdays, weddings, funerals, feasts, and are used to check how characters handle such occasions<br/>- it includes mending your own clothes, doing daily chores, working a farm, etc.<br/>- it is used to behave correctly, establish contacts, get friends and finding/winning sweethearts (typically done in festive social occasions)<br/><br/>It is used as a <i>pro-active</i> skill, not a reactive one. So it is used to inform the players how they characters do in social occasions, and then we play out the happenings accordingly. The "conflict" is not with other characters/NPCs, but with the social hopes and ambitions of the character.<br/><br/><b>Typical play example:</b><br/>- Player Geir is the lone ranger Nimrod. He is invited in his sisters wedding.<br/>- Geir says he will try to behave politely, which is fairly simple (skill of 7 + D20 must reach 10 or more to succeed). Him saying this establish Nimrod as a social outcast, who has done some bad things in the past (we don't know what).<br/>- Geir rolls a 5, with a total of 12; success!<br/>- We play out the scene, or a range of small scenes at the wedding, Nimrod being a nice brother all the way; not very eloquent, but conscientiously polite. It ends with his sister thanking him warmly for coming (and doing the effort), and his new brother in law being very friendly. <br/><br/><br/><b>Another typical play example:</b><br/>- Player Geir is the lone ranger Nimrod. He is invited to his sisters for the new year feast, and there's a lot of people coming. His sister says several of the women are single and on the look out ...<br/>- Geir says Nimrod will look for a girlfriend there, which is quite hard (skill of 7 + D20 must reach 30 or more to succeed). Him saying this is sending Nimrod in a new social direction, hopefully ...<br/>- Geir rolls a 5, with a total of 12; a far way from success!<br/>- We play out a range of small scenes at the feast, Nimrod being a clumsy man around the women, stepping on toes, getting irritated, drinking too much and starting to shout his frustration. His brother in law with friends cut the shouting short, and locks Nimrod in the smithy, to calm down. It ends at the breakfast table the next morning, with his sister refusing to talk with him and his brother in law shaking his head  in sadness.<br/><br/>One roll, and a lot of informed and enjoyable social interaction to be had from it. ;-)<br/><br/>The point is, I believe, not to focus on conflict in social interaction, but to focus on how to inform the players how to interpret their characters in social situations, based on what their ambition is and how their skills serve up. And then to let the social interplay develop in liege with that. It leaves the social interplay flexible and enjoyable, and something we are free to play out, and that is important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343580/#Comment_343580" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-22T03:10:36+00:00" title="September 22, 2011  3:10AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thats what they call fortune in the middle, isnt it Thomas?

For instance <i>Credible to Fred (3)</i>.  And using that in any situation where it would be appropriate to modify Freds behaviour based on your Credibility.  "<i>Sure Fred, you can take him out, he's just an Ogre runt..</i>."  <br/><br/>Somehow being good/poor in social situations should enter into it.   So perhaps a character might spend some time trying to build a relationship with another character of some sort.  And that gets marked down on the sheet.  But is the relationship really as reliable/solid as the character thinks?  He'll find out if he attempts to leverage it, using his social skill which could range from poor to great.  A character with poor social skills might find out latter he is not as liked/credible/sexy as he thought...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_343582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343582/#Comment_343582" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-22T04:33:55+00:00" title="September 22, 2011  4:33AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2011 4:34AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Thats what they call fortune in the middle, isnt it Thomas?

It's a simple solution, and one that works very well.<br/><br/>Mechanics that goes further in framing the social interaction invariably fails to come up with the flexibility and nuances necessary.

So how about just providing the character with social tools (means) and letting them select which and how they will accomplish their ends with them.<br/><br/>Tools I can think of:<br/><br/><b>seeming</b>: portray yourself in a certain way using appearance and/or words<br/><b>reading</b>: trying to work out the underlying truth of a situation based on verbal and/or non verbal cues<br/><b>bonding</b>: establishing an emotional connection with someone based on friendliness, respect, common-ground, attraction, etc...<br/><b>asserting</b>: establishing a status relationship with someone based on authority, dominance, credibility, leadership, obligtion, etc...<br/><b>communicating</b>: understanding or helping someone understand.<br/><br/>I think if you look at a social challenge as being broken down into employing different styles of one or more of the above, and employing them to achieve goals, then it solves both the 'short circuit' problem, and the problem of only having a hammer as your only tool.<br/><br/>The relationship-engineering comes mainly from asserting and/or bonding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_343688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343688/#Comment_343688" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-22T23:39:08+00:00" title="September 22, 2011 11:39PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2011 11:46PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, Steve, about the tendency amongst players (including GMs) to let skill-checks substitute roleplaying. It's very common, and hard to avoid. So I'm using both <i>fortune in the middle</i> and <i>fortune in the end</i> in my main classical rpg.<br/><br/>I just realized that I have a different understanding of <i>social skill</i> than you. <br/><br/>When you refer to someone manipulating a guard, to get into somewhere, I consider it a "political" skill. Skills like leadership, bluff, flattery and so forth, are not part of the social skills in my game. They are skills for political conflict, and typically used with <i>fortune in the end</i>.<br/><br/>The social skills in my game are not used to end a conflict, but to inform interpretation of character in social situations. There are five of them, altogether. Three of them are tied to the classes in society; one social skill for farmers, one for burghers, and one for nobles. And then there is a similar social skill for criminals, and a very special one for the ceremonial life at the kings court. All of them are used, in main, to feed character play in social situations (inns, dinners, festivities, dances, etc.). The one exception is the social skill for criminals, that may be used to fix and change your status in the criminal hierarchy. When we use it that way, it works as a "political" conflict skill.<br/><br/>So, I use <i>social skills</i> for normal social interaction (where people try to be nice to each other). Manipulations taking place in social situations are not considered part of normal social interaction, and are solved using <i>political conflict skills</i>.<br/><br/>I hope this enlightens you as much as it has enlightened me. I've done this for years, but it was just now I realized that this divide between social and political skills is quite important. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343691/#Comment_343691" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T00:26:14+00:00" title="September 23, 2011 12:26AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Im trying to do above is list a set of tools that can be put to any purpose, manipulation being but one.

being a subtle theme, you need to be very clear about the different venues of play, to expect ordinary players to handle them.<br/><br/>Interaction on the theme of informal social structures has been little done in role-playing games.

I propose for you not to do that, but to design methods for indulging in social interaction that don't lead to conflict, or any particular conclusion.

The tease is, however, based on an observation that anglo-american game-smiths have a tendency to put more weight on mechanics than I like. I like to think of how to use both <i>mechanics</i> (resolution systems) and <i>techniques</i>(verbal interactions) in game-design, both in modern and classical design. By using mechanical and technical tools in different variations, as your game needs them, I believe we have a greater chance of developing (over time) better role-playing games. As of now, anglo-american designers are still too lopsided in favor of mechanics. But they are coming around ...<br/><br/>But back on issue: what I'm trying to say here, is that if you want <i>social skill that isn't obnoxious aggression</i>, you have to look at how skills are used, and what the different use of them are most likely to produce. So you have to be careful with what kind of goals you set up, and how you deal with them; striving for goals often leads to in-game conflict-resolutions. Nothing wrong in having conflict-resolutions in games, per se, but using skills to win a conflict is most likely to produce winners, and <i>loosers</i>. That is not very healthy in a social context.<br/><br/>What is really healthy, though, is to immerse yourself, with co-players, in social interaction that recreates golden moments, moments of insecurity and release (or shame), and other kinds of moments that makes you feel alive, as your character, in the game. There is great joy to be had in that, and it is not well served by mechanics alone. Formalizing the game in too strong mechanical terms makes friendly social interaction harder to achieve. You have to think about how to feed the verbal interaction, to make it able to recreate the nuances of real life social interaction; including the basically friendly nature of it (us striving to be liked, and to understand each other). Feeding this interaction is often better done with a kind of "freedom of expression". That is; trusting the players to produce the nuances, based on their own experiences, and helping them by opening up the playing field, so that their nuances may pop out, and flourish.<br/><br/>When you succeed in doing it, it's like being granted a second personality with a life of its own, a totally captivating and thrilling experience. So go for it, Steve!<br/><br/>I once made a game with absolutely no conflict in it (Muu), and it worked very well (hilarious, and meditative, at the same time).

So you have to be careful with what kind of goals you set up, and how you deal with them; striving for goals often leads to in-game conflict-resolutions. Nothing wrong in having conflict-resolutions in games, per se, but using skills to win a conflict is most likely to produce winners, and<i>loosers</i>.
