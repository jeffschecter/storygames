Practically speed reading it. I have a deadline by which to finish it and feel like I have a competent grasp of the system. (If you really want to know why, PM me or something.)<br/><br/>Burning Wheel is a very, very intentional design. But without playing, and probably without playing for extended periods of time, it's hard to understand why some parts of that design are there.<br/><br/>So I figured I'd create a thread to ask a few questions in, as they come up/trouble me.<br/><br/>Any help would be much appreciated.<br/><br/>Question Number One:<br/><br/>Why aren't all Circles tests immediate in nature? Unless you want to pay for immediacy in higher obstacles, the default is the GM will introduce the contact at some point, maybe not even this session. The GM could choose not to let you and Harry meet until two sessions from now, couldn't he? I mean, unless you pay the +3 for "now or player decides".<br/><br/>It feels weird, because the importance of Circles seems to be finding the people you need, *when you need them*.<br/><br/>Question Number Two:<br/><br/>In Naming the Unknown (pg, 114), it says that "When trying to find a contat named in a previous Circles test, the player may search for named contacts without invoking any additional specificity penalties (i.e. it's the same obstacle as it was the first time)." Let me make sure I've got this right:<br/><br/>I can specify that I'm looking for this particular orc hunter. It's an uncommon occupation (+2), but he's at approximately the same station as me, I don't care where he is, I can find him whenever... The obstacle is 3.<br/><br/>Next time, even if I need him in a specific place, immediately, and let's say he's also gotten a promotion to Senior Orc Slayer... he's still going to be an Ob 3 test, right?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84481/#Comment_84481" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T00:09:44+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 12:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Why aren't all Circles tests immediate in nature?

But I would think that the gaming group would definitely make things work for their timing, rather than Luke's.<br/><br/>As an example for a circles test that you might not need immediately, how about you're looking for a guide to take you north, but you have things to do in town before you go. Or maybe you are looking to buy an unusual item and you make a circles check to see if you know a guy. <br/><br/>I can't give you AP, cuz Burning Wheel is one of the games I have read but not played yet. I'm hoping to change that soon. One thought that did occur to me is that while immediacy may not necessarily be critical, it doesn't seem like waiting around for a few sessions would add much to the awesome.

Is how quickly the NPC shows up an important element of the conflict? If not, don't include those obstacles. Only use it when the timing of an NPC's appearance is an important issue.<br/><br/>It's the same with any of the other obstacles. Does the NPC's station relative to the PC matter to the situation at hand?<br/><br/>This allows the player to drill down into what's <i>really</i> important about the NPC to her, while leaving all other details in the hands of the GM. The more the player decides she needs to specify about the NPC, the harder the roll becomes, while the more details she leaves in the hands of the GM, the easier it becomes.<br/><br/>At the same time, I think it's important to keep in mind that the mechanic's major thrust is not about whether or not you can find a particular character, but how that character feels about you. I generally recommend that the GM always invoke the Enmity Clause when failure occurs unless he has a good reason not to.<br/><br/>As to question 2, yes, you're correct. There is a bit of tangentially <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Burning_Wheel_Revised_Errata#Relationships.2C_Circles.2C_Affiliations_and_Reputations" rel="nofollow">related errata</a> though. The first time you bring the character into the game, you should add up the Circles + Affiliation + Reputation you used to bring that character in, and subtract it from 10. The number that remains is the number of times you need to bring in that character before he becomes a Relationship. Then you can bring that character into the story without rolling Circles at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84627/#Comment_84627" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T09:25:20+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  9:25AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe<br/>\n<br/>\nLets say you are a teacher at a wizard's academy. The headmaster's daughter has become infected by demonic magic, and the headmaster is away, in the capital, with the Emperor. So you have to cast the exorcism ritual yourself, and hope for the best. Hmm. It would be nice to have some help, right? Okay, use Circles to create an apprentice who knows enough to Help you (and maybe fight the demon?).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have the time to look over prospective assistant, test their skills, etc - no additional Ob.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have about an hour or so before you need to do the ritual, I'd say that's +1 Ob.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are in the middle of the ritual, a bunch of students are watching, and you just say "Wallace, you've memorized this ritual!

Valuable in its own right, for sure, but not exactly what was advertised.

I was surprised by the gaudy amount of dice even 3 Lifepath characters can get on a test through FoRKs, Helping, Artha and Linked Tests.

Say you want to find a master of the Dragonfly style to train you to become a master warrior. This is very different from wanting him right here, right now to help you slay the bandits that are about to beat you up and take your lunch money.<br/><br/>So you make your circles roll to find your master, and you don't specific "right here, right now". The next thing that happens is the GM takes the resutls of your test and turns it into a bang:<br/><br/>"OK, the only known master lives on top of this mountain on the other side of Ogre pass" or<br/>"Scamander, the master of Dragonfly style is a cantakerous man who lives right here in town. He takes an immediate disliking to you and wont' teach you unless you prove to him you're ready."<br/><br/>Circles and a lot of thing in BW (Resources, for example) are about what the character wants and what they have to do to get it. The "what they have to do" part is meant to be fun/cool/awesome adventuring stuff. It's a way of engaging the characters in the story and flagging stuff to the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
