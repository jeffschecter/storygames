Other than that, the only place "orders" seem to be referenced is in the Rank writeups.<br/><br/>Gregor, what's your intent behind the "orders"? <br/><br/>There's nothing mechanical to them, so they seem more like story hook type things than anything else -- you only care about them if you care about them, but the system's not gonna <i>make</i> you care. And that's totally cool. I'm already dreaming up ways for NPC officers to start pounding Order 6 into the heads of their underlings, probably via NFA E-damage attacks.<br/><br/>But I want to make sure I didn't overlook some vital graf explaining something like "you can't break orders, no way no how" or something like that. I'm sure *that* particular instruction isn't in the book, because it seems like "do you care about following orders, and if so how far can you be pushed?" is one of the core questions asked by the game.<br/><br/>A followup subject that is IMO totally okay for this thread: What are other 3:16 players doing with Orders? Some are very evocative (like Order 6, Order 8, Order 10!, and 14 and 16 look like likely end-game issues), while others ... I'm not sure what to do with. Like, how are players (PC players or GMs) treating the Corporal's order to "Maximize the kill ratio" different than, say, the Trooper's order to "Kill as many lifeforms as you can"? Ditto the Officer orders about ensuring no creatures survive in an encounter/on a planet/all planets/all the Cosmos. Just looking for inspiration here.<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167790/#Comment_167790" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T14:57:23+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  2:57PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2008 3:06PM by Eric.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the Corporal's order:<br/><br/>This order deals with a ratio, specifically the ratio of (Kills scored)/(Soldiers Engaged). This is critical. Suppose you have 3 Troopers: Alice, Bob, and Charlie.<br/><br/>Alice, a Trooper, kills 40 bugs per mission (high FA, upgraded Slug Rifle).<br/>Bob, the Corporal, kills 100 bugs per mission (high FA,  maxed-out E-Cannon).<br/>Charlie, the Sarge, kills 10 bugs per mission (Low FA, likes using their sidearm).<br/><br/>The ratio is 150 bugs/3 soldiers, or a 50:1 ratio. <br/><br/>Now suppose Bob _kills Charlie_. The ratio becomes 140/2, or a 70:1 ratio! Of course, Charlie's player will probably bring in a replacement, who may well be summarily executed if their FA and weapon selection isn't improved to Bob's liking.<br/><br/>So, the Corporal has an incentive to kill under-performing comrades if the Corporal decides to take that order seriously.<br/><br/>Edit: I realized this little quirk in the shower the morning after reading the book. I began laughing hysterically. It's something of a commentary on my personality that my wife was not phased in the least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167791/#Comment_167791" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T14:59:23+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  2:59PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh that's hot. <br/><br/>Keep 'em coming.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167792/#Comment_167792" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T14:59:51+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  2:59PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2008 3:07PM by Eric.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, note that we don't really know _when_ the ratio is assessed.

Unless, of course, the Sergeant is the worst, since this order may well not prevent suicide.<br/><br/>Order 5 (no alien survivors) combined with Order 3, Order 9, or other "obey your superiors" type Orders, creates a number of potential paradoxes. For example, suppose you're ordered to capture a living alien for experimentation. You can't satisfy all those orders at once! Even if you throw away lower-rank orders when you rank up, you still probably have inter-squad paradoxes.<br/><br/>Order 10 (never retreat) is pretty hilarious when combined with Force Weakness. <br/><br/>Order 12 (report insubordination) is also hilarious the first time you run into a Order paradox. So is Order 14 (kill those who disobey Orders). The latter might force you to suicide if you take it seriously and hit a paradox, particularly when combined with the Sarge's "protect your Troopers" Order.<br/><br/>Order 15 (kill all life) says _life_ in the cosmos, not _creatures_, so you are pretty much forced to genocide humanity if you take it seriously. Order 11 potentially does the same thing if someone isn't careful about what they say to you in the context of that Order. <br/><br/>Order 16 (never return to Terra) has only two ways to ensure its complete success: kill the Expeditionary Force or destroy Terra. They can't return if they don't exist or if the planet isn't there to return to. Conveniently for you, these are completely mutually compatible. Plus, hilariously, "protect Terra" isn't on any Order list.<br/><br/>Edit: also, while the term "creatures" is consistently used in the text to refer to xenomorphs, it is never actually defined as such explicitly. That opens up a lot of fun interpretations.<br/><br/>Remember how HAL went insane in "2001" due to a paradox of contradictory orders?

As I read the text, the only real recourse that a higher-ranking officer has in the face of an obstinately insubordinate underling is summary execution.

Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Anyway, a dead Trooper kills no bugs, but is also no longer a Trooper. It doesn't matter when you make the calculation, actually, though that does affect when you should execute the team scrub. <br/><br/>Option 1: The ratio is calculated continuously (after every combat round, say).<br/>Conclusion: Removing the worst performer is a good option as soon as you recognize them as such.<br/><br/>Option 2: The ratio is calculated based on the dead bugs at the _end_ of the mission divided by the Troopers around at the _beginning_ of the mission.<br/>Conclusion: Remove the worst performer between missions.<br/><br/>Option 3: The ratio is calculated based on the dead bugs at the _end_ of the mission divided by the number of surviving Troopers at the _completion_ of the mission.<br/>Conclusion: Remove the worst performer just before mission completion.<br/><br/>Finally, being nice and helping your teammates is fine and dandy if you mean "get them to use better weapons," but is a potentially disastrous plan if you mean "use NFA actions in combat to hand out +1 modifiers." That's actually counter-productive. The only thing that gets you more kills is higher-scoring weapons. An un-upgraded unarmed attack and a maxed-out E-Cannon both remove a threat token, but one only ever scores 1 kill and the other scores 50.5 kills on average at optimal range. As the Corporal, you probably have one of the best kill-scoring weapons in the squad. If anything, everyone else should be taking NFA actions to help _you_. Every bug that Mr. 1d6 Slug Rifle removes is _lost potential_, and the Trooper firing it is hurting your ratio every time they remove a threat token.<br/><br/>Of course, the only what for them to level up is to ignore that. Mr. 1d6 Slug Rifle needs all the shots he can take to try to overcome your huge weapon advantage, the ratio be damned. <br/><br/>Anyway, this scheme maximizes your team's ratio for a given number of Troopers. At that point, the only way to make that number go up is to eliminate the scrubs.<br/><br/>I'm quite fond of 3:16's Order setup. It seems quite nicely designed to set everyone at odds not only with each other, but with themselves. The players have a chain of requirements that _cannot_ be simultaneously satisfied, and that's quite amusing from the GM's perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168024/#Comment_168024" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T14:07:20+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  2:07PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As one of my players emailed to me:<br/><br/>"Orders remind me of the goodness that comes from Belief conflicts, except that the orders conflicts are baked in, no player effort required."<br/><br/>Which I think sums it up nicely.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168029/#Comment_168029" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T14:43:47+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  2:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another fun source of Orders hilarity:<br/><br/>Sometimes "Trooper" is used to generically refer to a serving member of the Expeditionary Force.

From his POV in the game there are a finite number of bugs facing him at one time. Maximising the kill ratio is about making sure no bugs escape and potentially removing underperforming troops - however that's a dodgy proposition because what if that one lost trooper is the difference between killing the big mother bug or seeing the whole squad getting wiped out in the last encounter?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm starting to see the potential of Orders though. I skipped over most of them as a bit of colour but they all can potentially affect how the game plays out.

Again, Legalistic perspective. Also, this is the same mindset that fuels both ultra-successful stock traders (when they get lucky) and the traders that wipe out whole firms (when they get unlucky).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168063/#Comment_168063" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T16:13:08+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  4:13PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My feeling is that the meta-gamey-ness of the Orders comes down to how the GM chooses to provoke/pursue/enforce the Orders.

So if I have NPC officers who are breathing down the neck of, say, a PC Lieutenant -- even to the point of getting into a nasty NFA E-damage duel -- most likely the Lieutenant's player will attempt the same down the line.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168434/#Comment_168434" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T02:11:43+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  2:11AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Each suit has a front facing display.
