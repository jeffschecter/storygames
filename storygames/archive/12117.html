It's what I do late at night when I can't sleep.  I've been taking notes with just this idea in mind.  The realization I came into is that doing it as an RPG is hard because personal vision of character would constantly be at war with fidelity to format.  The Law &amp; Order writers do a lot of interesting smoke and mirror stuff to cover this.  Like how many times a character will be "suspended" right at the end of a season with understanding that the suspension ends right at the start of the next season.  It's way to have character decisions LOOK like they have consequences without having to actually deal with the consequences so the format doesn't get broken.<br/><br/>One VERY interesting idea Christopher Kubasik came up with was to basically have the GM play the cops and the players take on the roles of the suspects from week to week.  The behavior of the suspects is often whats actually in doubt over the course of an episode.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271279/#Comment_271279" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T18:59:08+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  6:59PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would it look like <a href="http://ipressgames.com/serial.html" rel="nofollow">Serial Homicide Unit</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271284/#Comment_271284" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T19:07:14+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  7:07PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'd probably be 6"x9".

Then they'd switch in the next session, always going back to their police characters. The main location for the LARP would be "the station" and we would have supplemental locations that were crime scenes and witness homes and so on.  The cool part is that you wouldn't even need to travel to the LARP to be in the LARP, the "cops" would come to you. It broke down on the large number of locations needed - apparently a lot of gamers won't volunteer their living spaces (or the living spaces are horrible) even for a few minutes for an in-character conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parke" title="Parke"><img alt="Parke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v97/mikker/Zoosmell.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parke">Parke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271304/#Comment_271304" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T22:15:21+00:00" title="May 14, 2010 10:15PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would look canceled.<br/><br/>I think you'd need two different mini-games: one for investigation, one for courtroom drama.
