That combo of sight/sound/words fortuitously reminded me of a couple of articles I just saw on how some elements of the IDF was using critical theory to shape how they fought urban battles: <br/><br/>"During the attack \xe2\u20ac\xa6 soldiers did not often use the streets, roads, alleys, or courtyards that constitute the syntax of the city, as well as the external doors, internal stairwells, and windows that constitute the order of buildings, but rather moved horizontally through party walls, and vertically through holes blasted in ceilings and floors. \xe2\u20ac\xa6 <b>Moving through domestic interiors this maneuver turns inside to outside and private domains to thoroughfares</b>. Fighting took place within half-demolished living rooms, bedrooms and corridors of poorly built refugee homes, where the television may still be operating and a pot may still on the stove\xe2\u20ac\xa6. <br/><br/>Aviv Kochavi, then commander of the Paratrooper Brigade, explained the principle that guided the attack of the refugee camp of Batala and the adjacent Kasbah (old city) of Nablus:<br/>This space that you look at, this room that you look at, is nothing but your interpretation of it \xe2\u20ac\xa6 We interpreted the alley as a place forbidden to walk through, and the door as a place forbidden to pass through, and the window as a place forbidden to look through, because a weapon awaits us in the alley, and a booby trap awaits us behind the doors\xe2\u20ac\xa6 This is why that we opted for the methodology of walking through walls. [\xe2\u20ac\xa6] <b>Like a worm that eats its way forward, emerging at points and then disappearing</b>. We were thus moving from the interior of homes to their exterior in a surprising manner and in places we were not expected, arriving from behind and hitting the enemy that awaited us behind a corner. [\xe2\u20ac\xa6] I said to my troops, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Friends! This is not a matter of your choice! There is no other way of moving! If until now you were used to move along roads and sidewalks, forget it! <b>From now on we all walk through walls!\xe2\u20ac\x9d</b><br/>- Eyal Weizman, Walking Through Walls, <a href="http://eipcp.net/transversal/0507/weizman/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://eipcp.net/transversal/0507/weizman/en</a><br/><br/>The concept of burrowing through houses, and of turning private domains to battlefields, seemed to fit well with other aspects of the 'global war on terror' as well as the war in iraq in terms of intercepted communications, interrogations, winning/losing hearts &amp; minds, improvised explosives etc. So a game with three sets of characters, and players rotating among these perspectives:<br/>insurgents/ terror cell/ guerilla squad<br/>anti-terrorist special forces/police/military unit<br/>civilians in house/apartment, in the heart of the urban battlefield<br/><br/>game system could use strings as a measure of breaking points, connections, and count-downs<br/><br/>each turn players can place a string to create a 'worm-hole' through the house or show a connection (phone call etc) or shorten a string by cutting it (always place/cut same amount, or roll die to determine length added/cut?)<br/><br/>string represents:<br/>tunnel through house- complete penetration helps military<br/>fuse- count down to \xe2\u20ac\u02dcbomb event'<br/>breaking point of family in house, at end point they join terrorists, or turn in terrorists<br/>cool of terrorists to lie low<br/>will of captive/suspect under \xe2\u20ac\u02dcenhanced interrogation\xe2\u20ac\u2122 <br/><br/>need strings/ yarn (maybe different colors), ruler, scissors<br/>map of apartment/house, showing door(s) and adjacent buildings/streets<br/><br/>So any brainstorms on a string system would be welcome<br/><br/>Also, should this kind of game have a visible political stance, or, because players shift roles, be neutral/opaque or something?<br/><br/>thanks                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94141/#Comment_94141" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T07:37:12+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  7:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark, that's really cool.

One string represents something that the faction wants to accomplish: ie set off a truck bomb at a checkpoint, get a visa so their children can join relatives in syria, find out who in the neighborhood is acting as a spotter for sniper in the apartment block to the east. This goal will be written on the card along with a list of three characters from each side. The goals don't need to be set at the same scale of significance or with the same time scale- you could have the civilians leaving their house to find food during a daylong ceasefire on a religious holiday; the terrorists tracking an official's commute for a month to id the best location to seize him, and the military interrogating a captive for 5 minutes about the location of suspected ieds.<br/><br/>The other string (hopefully a different color or texture) represents something bad that could happen to the side while they are waiting for/pursuing their goal. I think, rather than having one bad thing written on the side's card, each player will have privately noted a consequence down. <br/><br/>When players cut lengths off the strings, it represents progress towards goals or an increased likelihood that a bad consequence will happen. So each string is like a countdown or a fuse, whether it is good or bad or measuring a minute or a month. <br/><br/>The other use of string will be to weave through the apartment or house that the civilians live in to show rooms being commandeered and/or holes being punched in walls by the military (or possibly the terrorists). I think players will draw a crude map of the home showing exterior and interior wall and what's to each side of the dwelling. The during play, you can punch a hole in the paper and thread a string through the map. This will have some consequence in terms of shifting civilian sympathies or triggering negative consequences etc.<br/><br/>The question for me is why players would cut one string vs another (after roleplaying scenes)- just interest in an outcome, some strategy, do shortened strings have other mechanical feedback on the system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
