I think there's fun stuff in there. I think it's been poorly supported in just that way: "Here are rules that are the physics of the game world. Also, there's a guy who decides when physics apply." That won't construct a game world with an objective, scientific basis; it'll create a world with a mysterious and fickle prime mover.

If the "physics" aren't fun, the players will find something fun to do, instead. It seems like it would be better to make rules that enforce "how the world works" ("lightsabers can cut through anything" "The coolest head wins the fight" "The wisest master is the dead one.") in a fun way, rather than assuming nonfun rules and having someone fill the gaps improvisationally.</p>\n<p>Note that, as designer of the game, I've already made the moral choices here.

It's sort of an alien safari. You have a character who acts as sort of roving eyeballs in an alien environment. The rules have to do with a) figuring out what you see and b) making sure that fits with everything else that's been seen already. Any "story" that evolves out of this will come about because humans can't help but tell stories. Any moral that comes out of it will be ambiguous at best, and more likely a cheap and crinkly thing, easily seen through.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68752/#Comment_68752" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T22:37:01+00:00" title="May 12, 2007 10:37PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh - You really owe it to yourself to read Jan Morris' "Last Letters From Hav".

But I have a <i>huge</i> desire to play a game set in a fairly historical 13th Century Europe.  Not to overcome challenges; not to tell stories with a tidy little moral at the end.  Just to <i>be</i> there.<br/><br/>The trouble is, I don't know any games that really make this work.  A very large number of RPG's--such as, say, GURPS--have elaborate rules for combat, or for how many batteries a Cloning Vat requires, or how much something costs in such-and-such time period.  But there are few, if any, rules for individual psychology (of PC's or NPC's) or rules for determing how cultural institutions behave.  <br/><br/>Exploration of character, exploration of setting - perhaps even exploration of situation---all of these are essentially left to the fiat of individual players, beyond a pretty gross level.  (Your character is 5' 4", is moderately bright, and is afraid of spiders.)  If I'm here to really experience being a peasant in Medieval Bavaria, the game isn't doing much of the work.<br/><br/>Thus, maybe the thing is to isolate (a) what people want to explore, (b) figure out how that thing behaves, and then (c) make interacting with that thing entertaining and game-able.  I would guess that for people who want to explore humans or their institutions, something deeper and more subtle than a d100 would be required, but I'm not basing that on anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68842/#Comment_68842" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-13T23:53:03+00:00" title="May 13, 2007 11:53PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, what sort of conversation are you looking for here?  <br/><br/>I'm happy to babble about Sim-like ideas, but I think there's a conceptual divide, because I like many of the games with what I think you're calling physics-like rules.

James <em>can't</em> fail to stop Blofeld from blowing up the world. What, is it gonna be Gamma World if you fail?

But that means you need the system to support it. Otherwise, you improvise it with uneven results. Once you've got a system down, then you can use it and you don't need to keep improvising.</p>\n<p>Buzz, the issue I have with the thread you link to is what I'm saying here: I think Sim is shortchanged by not having systems that support it. The example Balbinus gives are great, but I'm pretty sure Willow doesn't have hit points. It just doesn't make sense to measure things that way if that's not what the game's about.

It's that "what would <i>really</i> happen" impulse - taking <i>parts</i> of the source material and excising them for exploration while keeping a basic "RPG model" of mission-oriented tactical play. The thing is, in this mode the tactical, mission-oriented elements are part of <i>technical</i> preferences, not <i>creative</i>.

The joy of gambling. Yes, if you go to a poker game with fifty dollars in your pocket and lose all fifty, you come away from the game feeling grouchy and down and kicking yourself that you sat down at the game at all. If you win five hundred, you come away walking on a cloud and feeling like you're fifty feet tall.  Similarly, when your 007 character takes a risk and loses, thereby dying, being maimed, captured, losing the bad guy, etc. it feels bad.  But if there is no chance you will die, be maimed, be captured, lose the bad guy (whatever the stakes are), then there is no joy when you avoid those consequences and come through like a badass.  <br/><br/>Yes, yes, we can all set the stakes to whatever we want, but when watching a Bond movie, it's the action that gives us the thrills.  On one level we know that Bond is going to be awesome, on another level we feel thrills when the false suspense that he might not be this awesome is resolved.  In a game based on an action property, to get the thrill of action, there has to be some suspense. There has to be some gambling. As a result, sometimes you are going to lose and feel bad.<br/><br/>2.  A rules set that "gets out of the way", either due to player skill or designer artifice, is one that is easily tweaked by play groups to hit the (often very narrow) sweet spot of fake tension and real tension.  I know this thought is verboten, System Matters, blah blah blah. But there's a big difference between: Ian Fleming Bond novels, John Gardner Bond novels, 60s Bond movies, 70s-80s Bond movies, 90s Bond movies, and the Casino Royale film. A system that gives me a big muddled grab bag from which to assemble my Bond game is exactly right for a big muddled property. Something really clear and tight and coherent and precise is totally fucking wrong for me and would fall over in a big quivering pile of suck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69099/#Comment_69099" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T20:53:32+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  8:53PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2007 8:55PM by timfire.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>1.

That has a review of the basic game and also summaries of the four missions (3-5 sessions each) of the campaign.  I also made a <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=9726.0" rel="nofollow"><b>Forge thread on the campaign start</b></a>, in the Actual Play thread.  There wasn't any particular interest in that post, and I didn't post for later stages of the campaign -- though we had a ton of fun with it.  <br/><br/>The first adventure was a published one, but the later ones I created.  This was set in the mid-eighties, and I came up with the concept of naming the later adventures after eighties songs -- thus giving each one its theme song.  I retroactively named the first adventure "Down Under" since it was set in Australia.  The others were "When Doves Cry", "Hit Me With Your Best Shot", and "Everybody Wants to Rule the World".  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>See, for me, that's the<em>very essence</em>of pre-Casino Royale Bond. Without that, you're not playing Bond. And given that there's no support (that I recall) in the game for that kind of goings-on, I'd have to say that you <em>can't</em>play a James Bond character with those rules.Naturally, I'm not saying that the game's not fun. Obviously it's fun. But it sounds like it's not what I go to for a James Bond experience.</blockquote>\nWell, I don't think we're disagreeing here.  I was simply saying that I liked the JB007 RPG as a game and thought that it was good design.  I don't particularly care about essences per se.  As I commented in the original, I pictured Ian Fleming rolling in his grave over our campaign -- this since one of the PCs was gay, and thus met up with sexy NPCs like Phil McCracken and Ivan Moorcock rather than women.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Whether the rules need to make the assumptions you list is dependent on one's tastes. I've run and played in JB007 RPG adventures/campaigns without making those assumptions, and we still had a lot of fun. Perhaps we would have horrified a genre purist, but we didn't care.</blockquote><p>Then you're breaking out of Simulationist, and probably into Gamist play. If you're playing to defeat the evil genius/the GM/outshine each other as agents, that's what you're doing. Whether Q says "Now listen closely, [agentname]" <em>does</em>matter in a Sim context. I want to <em>be</em> in a James Bond movie when I play that game. I don't want a James Bond mask on the same game I played last time.</p>\nSigh.  This is an obvious false dichotomy -- that either a James Bond game has to involve going through a plot formula with no chance of failure or divergence, or it has to be the same game as last time.  This game was vastly different than the previous two games we'd played, which were Lord of the Rings and Dogs in the Vineyard.  <br/><br/>The players were not trying to beat the GM or outshine each other.  I think they did a good job of helping each other shine, actually.  They were trying to beat the bad guy, but the important thing was defeating him <i>in style</i>.  <br/><br/><br/><b>JD -</b> The James Bond 007 rules didn't get out of the way at all.  I picked it because I was enthusiastic about its system.  They helped drive the game -- especially things like the chase system, seduction, hero point spending and rewards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

If we think Simulation as something as something that seeks to simulate a setting - providing a living, breathing world in which the character interact - it's very hard to build a system that supports the experience. System that provides a way to handle the physics supports one small part of it, and depending on the quality of the resolution mechanics, might do a fine job doing it. System that would cover the other aspects of it - that now requite either improvisation or preparatory work, or usually mix of both - sounds like a holy grail one just does not find.  Plot formulas sound like an attempt to install control to an enviroment that's chaotic in nature.<br/><br/>I'd rather see mechanics that ensure that there's enough material in the chaotic system to ensure that things happen - character and character background creation, relationships, collaborative stuff that happens before the actual play - and material that communicates the system without being a rules mechanic. I might be representing minority here, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69123/#Comment_69123" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T03:59:16+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  3:59AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, have you seen <i>Dead of Night</i>?

I think what you need is to design the rules in such a way that the group doesn't need to jocky to determine where and what the creative limits are, as you folks are doing in the James Bond example.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance one thing I like about Heroquest, even though I've only played Mike Holmes Narrativist reinforcing method, is keywords. Keywords tell me in a mechanical way what a culture is about, they affect my ability to do things in the world, and I can choose to have my character reinforce his culture or play against it. This makes the world more real, and my character more real. My ability to do things in the fiction are not artificially created on a meta game level, but on who my character is. What I mean by this is my ability to do stuff doesn't derive from my class of cleric, from strength + trait, or everybody rolls a d6 for conflict resolution, but from who my character is in the world. If he's from Crazy Barbarian tribe, he's got big freaking sword, knowledge of the Ice lands, crude humor, frost resistance, foolhardy, etc. This means that I'm more effective when I use my big freaking sword, to do dangerous things, in the Ice Lands, while making jokes about my opponents shriveled member. That reinforces my character, his culture, and the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake the game so that the fixed fiction of the game book is what I need to use to manipulate the created fiction of the game and then I think you are supporting Sim well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69136/#Comment_69136" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T06:19:53+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  6:19AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clyde, your point is taken, but I would hesitate to use HeroQuest as an example of Sim supporting design, especially if you were playing with Mike H.

It's also possible for a Game to promote one CA, and be supported by another. For instance, most forge baked games use Gamist play to support their Narritivism. That would mean it's also possible to play a Narritivist game supported by sim, which is how I would personally classify Mike's games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly I wasn't holding up all of Heroquest for inspection, just Keywords.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69175/#Comment_69175" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T08:01:52+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  8:01AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, having risk built into the system is gamist, just like simulating a genre or work that has difficult thematic choices is narrativist. In other words, not at all.<br><br>Where do the thrills in action movies come from? We know on some level that it's all a big ruse, completely fake. Nobody is going to kill James Bond. Nobody is going to cripple John McClain. The bad guys will be captured, if not now, then in a later sequel. The plan of the bad guys is not going to happen. The fact that everyone on the screen takes the threat seriously, though, is what gives us the license to believe in the fake suspense.<br><br>There's a similar aspect to many action-oriented games. You write up detailed combat rules so that the audience (players) will take the threat to their characters seriously, thereby investing in the thrill of the action. The fact that sometimes you are able to carry out the threat is simply a freedom of the medium that movies and TV shows don't have, not some dreadful mistake on the part of the designers allowing for outcomes that don't perfectly match the source material.

Newman</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>This is an obvious false dichotomy -- that either a James Bond game has to involve going through a plot formula with no chance of failure or divergence, or it has to be the same game as last time. This game was vastly different than the previous two games we'd played, which were Lord of the Rings and Dogs in the Vineyard.</blockquote><p>Dogs in the Vineyard supports a particular CA and supports its own type of Situation. That's not what I'm talking about. Lord of the Rings is a great example: there is<em>nothing</em>in there that's not in two or three other games. The one reason I bought the game was because I'd been thinking about addiction mechanics and I was told that the Ring mechanic was good. It is total garbage specifically because of its adherence to fantasy RPG clich\xc3\xa9.</p>\nWell, I agree the the Lord of the Rings RPG is total garbage, but not simply because of adhering to the clich\xc3\xa9.  If it was just that, it would be derivative and stale, but at least playable.  As it stands, though, it is total garbage which isn't even playable without ignoring rules regularly and patching things up.  <br><br>James Bond 007 is quite unlike that.  It was original, holds up well, and has a lot of nice features like the hero point awards, the emphasis on level of success rather than success/failure, and good coverage of actions like chases (with the fairly unique bidding system), seduction, interrogation, and gambling.  There are few games like it.  (Though there is Tonio Loewald <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foresight</span> which directly rips it off.)  <br><br>As far as GNS-classifying my campaigns, my experience has been that doing so has generated a lot of heat and no particular light.

It was like 20 years ago so please excuse me for lack of details. I had two players, my brother Jason and my friend Mark, who made up agents and they went on their merry way trying to do agenty things. I think they failed some critical roll and the villain got away and managed to place a bomb on a train and blew up the person they were protecting. Something like that. Anyway, we thought the game sucked. It didn't give us the kind of experience that we wanted.<br/><br/>For us, we wanted to feel like James-fucking-Bond. We wanted to succeed most of the time -- or have clear alternatives when we failed. We wanted to come out of gunfights without a smudge on our clean, pressed suits. Most importantly, we wanted more tools to say, "No, fuck that, this dumb-ass thing doesn't happen." Instead, we were slave to the dice, which said *whiff* "you miss." Sucktastic.<br/><br/>I am <i>not</i> saying that other people can't have great Bond games. I'm saying that I felt that, playing the game as written, it will only rarely produce the kind of Bond game I want. I might be able to run a game and get results I liked better by ignoring rules and replacing them with fiat but then I'm in uncharted territory. Only because I have huge amounts of GM experience and some game design experience do I feel qualified to toss the rules over my shoulder and wing it.<br/><br/>Sim-supporting rules need to address the desire of players to say no. No, that shit does not happen. No, Bond would not get killed. No, Bond would not totally fail his mission. No, Bond would not get hit in the balls with a knotted rope. Not in <i>my</i> 007 game. This is the "constructive denial" thing I talked about in one of the other threads. By saying no, the players are saying what the game is not, and therefore they're defining what the game is. Carving away everything that isn't an elephant.<br/><br/>Sim-supporting rules can go the other way, too. They can give you tools for locking down what is in the game. Universalis does this. Really, though, it's built around a clever mechanic for saying no disguised as a yes. While you're saying "yes, this!" the other players are outbidding you and saying, "uh, I don't think we want that in this game."<br/><br/>Mechanisms that give GM override powers can support Sim. This basically tells everyone at the table that one of the GM's responsibilities is to protect the integrity of the Sim-space, be it verisimilitude, rulespace, or whatever you're using to get your jazz on.<br/><br/>Mechanisms that give players a trump card for the rules (fate points and the like) can support Sim. Did you just whiff a roll that you <i>know</i> you should have made ("Zornan the Barbarian NEVER misses when he's angry!)? Spend a Reality Point and change the die roll to an automatic success. And any other player can spend a Reality Point to counteract yours if they think you're doing something bogus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69243/#Comment_69243" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T10:45:27+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 10:45AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is probably an aside to all this talk about the James Bond RPG (which I never played, even though for some reason I have the 'Dr. No' boxed adventure *shrug*)... but reading this thread has finally started to clear my perception on what Sim actually <i>is</i> (or rather, I suppose, one aspect of what it could be). I totally dig rules that are explicitly coupled to the expectation that a genre/book/movie creates. <br/><br/>I... I... think that I like Sim play. Does that make me a bad person *wink*?<br/><br/>To Jason's point concerning RPGs allowing the chance to occasionally back up the 'threat' of failure inherent in any game system, I agree to a point. I think that the defining aspect is actually one of risk versus a predestined outcome (and give your mention of stakes escalation I am sure you are way ahead of me on this one).  An element of risk in the dice rolling makes things more exciting (although risk-less mechanics show that it is certainly not necessary)... but for me and my always flawed grasp of Sim, if this risk allows James Bond to fail in a way that is not consistent with the genre expectations then the game design has failed to deliver what I am looking for.<br/><br/>For instance if, as part of a fight scene, James gets shot and killed by random mook 103 (because the GM got a good roll)... then to me, that is no longer James Bond. On the other hand, if the consequences for failing a fight scene were that James gets captured and brought to the villain's lair (a bad plan for the villain if there ever was one), then you have satisfied my genre expectations without eliminating some element of risk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69244/#Comment_69244" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T10:45:28+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 10:45AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2007 10:50AM by jhkim.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Edit:</b> <i>Sorry.

Because if you play rookie agents, then rather obviously, things will be vastly different from the James Bond source material.  Playing Double-0 rank agents, my experience was there was nearly no whiff in the game.  For our game, chances to succeed were generally over 100%, and the question was instead over what Quality Rating of success you achieve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69246/#Comment_69246" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T10:50:55+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 10:50AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish I could remember.

I generally ran Champions and JB007 by the book.  In Champions, there is an explicit stage prior to the game where you set up the options for that campaign.  There is a step-by-step set of questions with worksheets and everything.  For example, Sorcerer does a parallel process, with a stage prior to the campaign where you determine what Humanity is and so forth.  <br/><br/>Also, most games have explicit times when you invoke the dice mechanics, and times when you don't.  For example, in Dogs in the Vineyard much of play is essentially freeform with no dice-rolling or mechanics involved -- just like in much of Champions play.  Since in both cases that is what the game explicitly directs you to do, I don't consider that ignoring the system.<br/><br/>There are certainly games where I was forced to ignore the rules.  Towards the end of my recent Call of Cthulhu campaign I was often dropping out of the rules entirely, and in the Lord of the Rings RPG we had to modify and ignore rules from the start.  That's different than saying something like "don't play out every minute of a trip round-by-round" -- which is explicitly in the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69285/#Comment_69285" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T12:00:45+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 12:00PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread, especially the JB007 portions, could not possibly be better evidence that genre-based Sim and physics-based Sim are two different creative agendas.

Like with Bond RPG, where what you get is a pretty focused system for "paramilitary/espionage adventure" or whatever, which may or may not have anything to do with "the Bond experience", however you want to define that. Or with GURPS Swashbucklers, which is really just GURPS with some historical splats and "flavored" combat rules, and may not help produce content that you define as key to the swashbuckling genre.<br/><br/>So, if you're hip to buying into the ideal that's presented to you, even if it doesn't match your initial expectations, it's all good; if you're not, you have friction. Is that where we're at?<br/><br/>I think it's pretty troublesome to approach "supporting Sim" as a generic goal. Case in point, all the banter above about Bond and what it does or does not provide relative to expectations. It strikes me that, from a design perspective, you can only really talk about "Sim of X" and "Sim of Y". <br/><br/>This makes GURPS and its descendants all the more interesting to talk about, because as it stands, it's not "Sim of" anything. It's more like giving you a chassis and saying, "Hey, this thing produces certain results under certain conditions. If that reminds you of or suggests an ideal, cool beans. If not, maybe you can tweak it with these alternate rules so it'll match closely enough." This approach seems imprecise, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Does all Sim-focused design have to come front-loaded with an ideal, then, for optimal support? Or is the real key to "generic" Sim design the ability to use game currency to negotiate over properties of the ideal, like Adam Dray suggests?<br/><br/>And isn't Universalis already that game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69293/#Comment_69293" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T12:20:28+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 12:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>This thread, especially the JB007 portions, could not possibly be better evidence that genre-based Sim and physics-based Sim are two different creative agendas.</blockquote>\nMike, is there any debate that there can be conflicts within each mode?

The more general suckiness, compared to a lot of these never and more narrative games, is that the latter tell you very exactly how to play the game, whereas a lot of the "mainstream" games really do not, but rely on the player expertise to figure it out.\n<blockquote>Also, most games have explicit times when you invoke the dice mechanics, and times when you don't.  For example, in Dogs in the Vineyard much of play is essentially freeform with no dice-rolling or mechanics involved -- just like in much of Champions play.  Since in both cases that is what the game explicitly directs you to do, I don't consider that ignoring the system.</blockquote>\nI don't know if there is a difference in ignoring rules and just using them very sporadically; the DitV rules kind of imply that you should use the rules and use them often, if only by not really telling anything about how to freeform (or play in between invoking the rules) and straight out telling you to escalate as soon as possible. Not escalating often - spending an entire session just sitting around the campfire and bonding - might not be ignoring the rules, but feels kind of playing the game in other way than it was meant to be. Which, I think, is an excellent thing.<br/><br/>The problem with a lot of mainstream/sim games is that apart from telling you how to use the character creation and resolution system, and giving you a lot of inspirational material, they don't really touch the subjects of running or playing the game, preparing for it and the like. They just hand out a small portion of the tools in the box and trust that the players have their own tools with them for the rest. The approach that a lot of these Narrative games use, extending the rules to cover the stuff that mainstream games have left for players, kicks my Sim style to the teeth since I already have my own tools and I consider a lot of them to be superior since they've been tailor-made. This might be my personal limitation, though I'd suspect it's shared by a lot of Sim folks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69303/#Comment_69303" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T12:30:45+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 12:30PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find the physics-sim vs. genre-sim distinction to be unnecessary, and incomplete.

Through choice of aspects, players are telling the GM what genre elements they feel are important and want to explore. At the same time, the GM is given a mechanism for encouraging use of those aspects or rewarding players when HE has a genre element that he wants to explore (like giving players Fate points to let the villain escape).<br/><br/>It encourages traditional 'physics' style play while still providing an explicit method of maintaining genre boundaries.

When you play D&amp;D 1st or 2nd Edition, you're buying into a certain kind of fantasy game. The rules are the setting, even without additional setting guides. Setting is part of system. I have never played GURPS Supers, so I can't comment on it. I suspect the people who play it for a long time play it because it gives them a supers experience that makes them happy. At least, I hope so!<br/><br/>Just because it doesn't (for sake of argument) make me happy doesn't mean it doesn't support Sim. It just means it doesn't support the Dream that I want to have. It could be the best supers-supporting Sim game out there, but if I wanted to play a Star Trek game, it's gonna suck for me. <br/><br/>You can go the Universalis or Fudge or FATE route and strip out the things that you think will be contentious, right? Hey, I can use FATE to play Star Trek or Superfriends or Lord of the Rings. It has no specific Sim support for those genres exactly but it has some pretty fucking nifty tools that allow me to customize my game for any genre, so that's sweet. I have to do a little game design (craft a magic system for LotR and a powers/stunts system for Superfriends, maybe) but it's pretty lightweight work. <br/><br/>Am I making sense? Am I rambling?\n<blockquote>d20 example? Star Wars. Totally packed with character and setting details, totally has all the names of all the Star Wars things stretched across D&amp;D's rules chassis. Does the result remotely remind you of Star Wars?<br/><br/>And I know that genre and property emulation aren't the only forms of Sim play. But it's the biggest one, so I'm sticking with it for now.</blockquote>\nOkay, good example. I've played both WEG Star Wars (D6) and WotC Star Wars (D20). I also wrote a percentile-based Star Wars game when I was a teen; I'd classify it as VERY Sim.<br/><br/>I'll turn the question back on you: Do the character and setting details NOT support Sim? How can they not? A Star Wars Sim player wants to get his brain into his version of the Star Wars universe and rock and roll in it. I mean, fuck, who wouldn't? So first, you have to have a clue what that universe is! D20 Star Wars hands you a good deal of setting information that helps you wrap your brain around it. It gives you character options that let you imagine being there. <br/><br/>Does it put you in the movies? Not really. Is it trying to? I don't think so. It's trying to put you in the Star Wars universe. You might not even be on the Rebel side. <br/><br/>When my friend Jesse ran SW D20 for us, I played a little tech dweeb. He was a lousy shot with a blaster and mostly ran from combats. As a player, I totally got my groove on by playing with the universe like it was a big Star Wars engine. I expected bits from the movies and books to be there and Jesse complied. My favorite scene was where we were helping some Rebels at a secret base and I met this starship engineer/designer. He was totally awesome and pretty much overshadowed all of the PCs in coolness. So I wanted to play with his computer, and I wanted to impress him with my own starship design skills, and Jesse asks me to roll and I toss out a natural 20. He tells me that I get to do something really cool and I suggest that I designed the A-wing. He laughed and said okay, when the supercool designer guy wakes up, I've been up all night and he finds my rough A-wing design on his computer -- and he steals it and doesn't credit me. Sweet!!<br/><br/>Where was the Sim support for this? Certainly not in the dice rolling bits. Interpreting a natural 20 as something cool isn't really a rule, nor would it be much of a special rule. The Sim support was the setting material. Whether the setting was written in the game books or brought into the game from our experiences at movie theaters is irrelevant. We brought our own expecations and experiences into the game, and the setting material was an important part of it. <br/><br/>I'm not saying setting always supports Sim. I'm saying any part of the game can support Sim. It's all just tools for supporting any Creative Agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69328/#Comment_69328" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T13:09:21+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  1:09PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DirkGently</cite>The more I think about it... the more I think that the Aspect system from SoTC/Fate may be the closest thing to a perfect "genre" Sim without creating an explicitly tailored rules set (or going all hippy and using Universalis *grin*).</blockquote>\nDamn!

with something else here, which is "immersion sim" (to try to start a flamewar).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, the "risks" that some people are citing are, in fact, often not at all about gamism as some suspect. Oh, to be sure, the form of sim in question emerges from play that was sim/gam incoherent, and games that support that. But it's a valid form of play in and of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically where somebody wants to "be" James Bond. You can't get the feel of what it's like to be shot at as James Bond, unless there's a chance that you might get hit and killed. Or so the theory goes. This attempt to be "in" the game is a very important sub-brand of sim. In fact, in looking at sim as trying to reduce the appearance of the other two metagame urges (in order to make the illusion of reality more fecund), we can see that this is, in fact, somewhat important to almost all sim play. Put yet another way, we don't want to see players making decisions, we want to see characters making decisions, as the characters "would" if they were real.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, "Genre Sim" is neither common, nor much sought after. It's what "narrativists" like Josh think that sim is all about, but rarely actually is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat supports sim is quite a broad question, as it is with either of the other two modes. There is no one correct answer. A particular rules-set probably only supports one sort of sim well, if at all. GURPS supports combat and the like in most any genre (interestingly this rarely leads to "realisitc" decision-making, something that it's supposedly realistic system should theoretically produce).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUniversalis is more "non-gamist" than it is narrativism, and only "non-sim" in that it doesn't do anything to support sim. It's narrativism supporting nearly by default (the argument goes that in promoting conflicts that benefit everyone, it promotes players creating their own premises through the conflicts). SOTC is, I'd agree, good for Genre Sim. It also drifts very easily to narrativism, however. How much that constitutes a problem for it being sim supportive is a matter of how much you think that ketchup ruins the taste of a good burger. Probably not a big deal, as you can always just use less ketchup.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69355/#Comment_69355" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T13:54:40+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  1:54PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2007 1:59PM by misuba.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I just totally disagree with this:<br><br><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>This thread, especially the JB007 portions, could not possibly be better evidence that genre-based Sim and physics-based Sim are two different creative agendas.</br></br></blockquote>\nI don't see the evidence here of two different CAs.

I'd argue that you're not really buying into a supers game at all. I have played it, and used it as an example specifically because of that - the default scale on which GURPS resolves things breaks like so much dropped china when you try and scale it up to superhuman levels. The rigidity there is its own worst enemy, as are just about any attempts at standardizing rigid causal effects for supers play.<br><br>I have an issue with calling that "support" for supers-Sim, because it will almost always fail to produce output to meet expectations for that genre. Are there folks out there who's ideal really is "the range of outcomes provided by the GURPS mechanics and framework"? Probably a few, but satisfying them in this context is a no-brainer.\n<blockquote>I'll turn the question back on you: Do the character and setting details NOT support Sim? How can they not?</blockquote>\nBy themselves? Not necessarily, anymore than me describing something to you helps you to experience it. Can it give you an idea of what the experience will be like? Sure, but that's all. You have to marry those details with a system that will allow you to experience the ideal. \n<blockquote>Does it put you in the movies? Not really. Is it trying to?

Which suggests certain narrative expectations. Which d20 doesn't do anything to create or fulfill - and in fact, in order to fulfill the "dungeoneering" elements required by the mechanics, tacks on arbitrary stuff to characters that doesn't remotely resemble anything in the media. Chewbacca has Trailblazing? What? Where'd that come from? <br><br>And if putting you in the media is not the goal, why does one of the bullets on the website say it lets you "craft an exciting story full of the depth, energy, and entertainment of the entire Star Wars saga"?\n<blockquote>Where was the Sim support for this?</blockquote>\nNot anywhere in that game book, according to your example. You had expectations for content, which your GM provided.

Sure, but that's all. You have to marry those details with a system that will allow you to experience the ideal.<br><br>No, not by themselves. No single aspect of system supports Sim by itself. (I'm not allowed to begin any new words with an S. Okay?)<br><br>Right now, I have in my head an image of a big, heavy wooden platform labeled Sim (or Creative Agenda, if you want). There are a bunch of people lifting it and some gamers playing on it. The lifters have t-shirts with labels. One says "Setting." Another says "Techniques." Another says "Character." Another says "System." And so on. Who supports the platform? All of them. None of them do it alone.<br/><br/>That's what I mean when I say that the setting material in D20 Star Wars supports Sim. It's just one thing doing some lifting.<br/><br/>I think you're making an argument that D20 has a lot of stuff in it that makes for a lousy Star Wars game. If so, let me wholeheartedly nod my head with you. I'm not disagreeing with that. I'm just saying that it also contains a bunch of stuff that supports Sim. Maybe not enough though.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>Where was the Sim support for this?</blockquote>\nNot anywhere in that game book, according to your example.

So far, you could be playing any RPG with a Star Wars theme and have the same result from actual play.<br/><br/>None of this adds up to Sim support coming<i>from the game</i>, to me.<br/><br/>I didn't make my point clear. The Sim support for my cool Star Wars A-wing moment was the setting material. I don't know A-wing fighter stuff is in the rulebook or not. It doesn't matter. It could have been. If instead we'd been playing Stellar Battles, in a weird science fantasy of my GM's design, all the setting material would have to come out of the rulebooks and I think you could see how it would support Sim play. The more setting stuff you write in your Stellar Battles book, the more players have to draw from to support Sim play.<br/><br/>That's all I'm saying. Setting can help to support Sim. (Even if you get your Setting from a source outside the rules, as Sim players <i>often</i> do. Reference any of Silmenume's threads about Lord of the Rings role-playing on The Forge.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69377/#Comment_69377" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T14:34:53+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  2:34PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2007 2:36PM by DirkGently.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>In fact, "Genre Sim" is neither common, nor much sought after.

Or, it hasn't come along for Tolkienesque fantasy, at which point things will really explode.<br/><br/>More of my hare-brained opinions: Genre Sim is like Narrativism in many ways, two of which are: 1) tools intended for Narrativism are often very useful for GenreSim, and 2) the various folks working on what has become the Big Model can <i>almost</i> be said to have invented GenreSim as much as identified it.

But, I think it's possible for system elements to effectively cripple or nullify the efficacy of setting/color material for supporting Sim. If you tell me "supers", and I get all hyped up about supers, and then you present me with a gritty, super-precise, chart-based hit and damage system, all the effort you spent getting me hyped up about supers not only goes to waste, but actively helps in creating disappointment.<br/><br/>The Star Wars d20 stuff is the same way for me. Yeah, it's all the stuff I recognize, but the way it all interacts and works is so, so wrong. So, it ends up harming my interaction with those setting elements, too.<br/><br/>Hence, I can't really call it "support" at that point, because all the elements are working to each other's detriment.

The idea that everyone is going to take away from a muddled, incoherent or "incomplete" property the same kinds of things for the same kinds of game with the same kinds of group is insane and nobody who has played and enjoyed licensed games for any length of time believes it. In other words, a super-focused Star Wars game that produced a game like the one that you like probably would be hated and spat upon by my group as being nothing like a Star Wars game that we wanted.

The holy grail of Sim games (which I don't think has been created yet) will probably have to involve allowing players and gamemasters a high level of customization to make sure that everyone is on the same page to alleviate that same problem.<br/><br/>I don't think that this excludes a very focused design or a 'generic ruleset'... and I see an increasing movement towards this sort of thing. Look at the rules to the new Spycraft, for instance. Although the rules overhead is way too high for my group, there is a lot of strong stuff in there about mechanically emulating the look and feel of a spy genre chase scene (or hacking scene, or interrogation scene). There is also a list of dials in the back and suggestions for how to explicitly tune them to get the system to work like you want. Though I mentioned it earlier, SoTC is another excellent example of genre emulation in the rules without a hard and fast list saying "these are the things you must do".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69616/#Comment_69616" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T08:52:56+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  8:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa, lots to answer here.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, while I think that Genre Sim is relatively rare, as I then say, I think that games like FATE do it well. So it does exist as a newer phenomenon in greater quantity. Put another way, if you like Genre Sim, I think that right not is a good time for you. Systems to support it strongly are appearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I have been called on that statement, in terms of whether I can back it up, and I should say that this is just my own observation. The point I was trying to make is not that people do not play genre sim (much less should not), but that as a proportion of sim play I think it historically has taken a back seat to the prevalence of more immersion-driven sim. That is, where something like James Bond does not seem to support Genre Sim, that's because it intends to support Immersion Sim.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe border between Genre Sim and Immersion Sim is like where somebody says, "I know that James Bond always gets the bad guys, but without a chance to fail, it doesn't feel like I'm there and in the action." That's stilted, sure, but hopefully you get the idea. That's not to say that Genre Sim can't have a chance to fail. It means that in each of these something different is being cherished at the expense of something else. In Genre, we do more to promote the genre, at the expense of the feeling of "being there," whereas in Immersion sim we sacrifice the story looking like a James Bond story for the feeling that we're "being" James Bond.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, does the whiff factor support immersion sim? Tough question. It's going to come down to whether the people playing think that the level that the factor is at is "realistic." I'm not saying that James Bond is, in fact, well designed to deliver what it intends. Merely that this seems to me to be the goal. It man, in fact, fall short of even that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd is that possibly in part because of the rules also being from an era that assumes some gamism in play (meaning that the system promotes multiple modes, and thus incoherence)? Probably. James Bond, you have to understand, was pretty remarkable for it's time in how it made much of any attempt to model genre. Top Secret, actually, had started down this road with the inclusion of Fame and Fortune Points. That's a very rough beginning. But it's a tiny move from "Gamism Spy Dungeons" to something a tad more like the genre. James Bond was a huge leap forward from that. Tremendous. Just including rules for car chases, for instance, meant that they would occur in spy play (whereas before, as I say, the play was all about traipsing across quadrille rendered maps with rooms with contents descriptions). Rather, some people were doing this stuff despite these systems to be sure. But the systems were trying hard to keep up. Top Secret at least allowed you to have your character behave heroically while he still had points. As opposed to those dungeon crawling cowards who run as soon as they're out of magic missiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstanding a Genre Sim focus, games today can go even farther down these roads, and do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, some people playing freeform moved that way to avoid any gamism intrusion on their sim (just as some moved that way due to the same cause in order to get narrativism in play).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam, for you, Uni might produce sim. For you playing with me, it might produce narrativism. This is the really difficult part about saying that Game X supports Mode B best. Because Mode B is produced by the players, and, as JD would tell us, no system survives contact with the players. You can only talk in gross generalities of what it "probably" does for "most" players. The only thing you can say for sure is, "Game Y supported Mode A for me."<br/>\n<br/>\n(This is why many have moved on from GNS to discussing Creative Agenda. It's less important that the system produce Mode C than it support activities in play that produce <i>any</i> coherent agenda, whatever that is. What mode does Universalis support? We can go around and around about that. What I can be proud of - if I can - is that most people who play it seem to "get" what the play is about, and everybody plays along those lines. Which neccessarily is informed to some extent by the players and how they actually play. With Uni, you don't seem to get players going different directions, even if it's not precisely one direction provided by the system. The group picks a single way to play. This seems to produce a quality experience most of the time. The players provide the fun, we just provide a method by which to agree to how to get at it. One of the qualities of the system is the extent to which it facilitates getting to this agreement. If you can get there by "just playing" that's optimal. )<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69654/#Comment_69654" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T10:23:56+00:00" title="May 16, 2007 10:23AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Mike.  <br><br>I responded about your comments on JB007 on the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3037&amp;page=1#Item_15" rel="nofollow"><b>James Bond 007 gaming</b></a> thread.
