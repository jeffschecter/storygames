I'm <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/viewforum.php?f=15" rel="nofollow">running one</a> and it is (as always) a wonderful luxury (and a dangerous temptation) to be able to dissect what's happening moment-to-moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I'm seeing is that PBP removes one of the layers of feedback that gives people confidence.  Around a table, if you say "Hey, I'm going to play a Lesbian-Stripper-Catgirl-Ninja" and you aren't immediately greeted by a cold and stony silence punctuated with the sounds of crickets chirping ... well then, you gain a bit of confidence that the idea is not <b>completely</b> out in left field.  Right or wrong, you can derive a lot from the body language at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in PBP, <b>every</b> response is greeted (at least for a while) with cold and stony silence.  It's not an instant medium.  And it's impossible to tell the difference between "Tony's not at his computer" and "Tony is at his computer, wailing and pulling at his hair, trying to figure out some polite way to respond to my suggested character type."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would probably be the right time to point out, positively, that I love my players and I am tremendously enjoying their character concepts ... right?  But if they're the type to worry ... how do they know that?  Even if I just said that I loved everything they've done to date, how do they know that I'll love <i>the next thing</i>?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm finding that people are deliberately looking to map out some restrictions ("How much can I say about an NPC's actions?"  "What sort of character types can we play?") and I think that it's a way of gaining the same confidence through another mechanism.  If the game specifically says "You may not play robots or pirates" (though I can't imagine a sensible game that <b>would</b>) then you gain a little confidence to say "Well, a lesbian stripper cat-girl ninja is not either a robot or a pirate."  That gives you some more confidence.  If the game explicitly says that Ninja is an allowable class and Cat-Girl is an allowable species then you really get a <b>lot</b> of confidence that other people are going to accept your contribution.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this the justification for laundry-lists of character types/origins, or shopping malls full of distinctive equipment?  Not to <i>inspire</i> people to be creative, but rather to give them very explicit assurance that they can be creative in specific ways without crossing the line and distressing their fellow players?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60537/#Comment_60537" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T07:52:35+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  7:52AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely.

If those two, together, are enough then they prime the pump and from there on in you just go, go, go!  But if they <i>aren't</i> enough then groups can flounder, until somebody takes the chance on offering something <i>without</i> the assurance that it'll be okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this why so many indie games are narrow-focus?  Is a narrow focus and the constraints it implies an <i>alternative</i> to huge lists of equipment and feats and the explicit approval <i>they</i> imply?  I think it may be, but I think that both of those may be missing an intriguing <i>other path</i> that gives people the confidence and structure to create constraints and approvals from whole cloth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I'm thinking particularly of <i>Mortal Coil</i> and it's magic system ... a system that gives people a meta-structure of how to create constraints and approvals, without actually offering people any pre-determined constraints.  It's the fuzzy grey area between play and design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61074/#Comment_61074" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T13:28:08+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  1:28PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play by mail is an interesting way to play a game. I remember playing board games play by post thirty years ago and running the GDW RPG EnGarde pbm in High School at around the same time. It cuts out all the interaction between players of face to face games but gives you a strategic distance from it as well so you can view games as problem solving. There is an emotion to it but I wonder if it could be termed story now?<br>\n<br>\nEngle Matrix Games have always been done pbm (now pbem) and show why constraints are vital. The scenario of the game helps get everyone on the same mental map/matrix. Without it people talk past one another too much. Next, limits on action help people be able to see the game happening. No constraint means an "I win" statement can happen. That's no fun for anyone. I like to think of games taking time - say a face to face game lasts twenty turns. The drama of play is enacted in the actions of those turns. A pbm game could go through the same set of actions - just over a longer period of time. No one will agree on what the right number of steps should be but you know when there are not enough or too many (it's choppy or drags).<br>\n<br>\nPbems are unforgiving in many ways. If a game does not grip people they drop out and the game dies. So many die on turn two! I find it helpful to give people a clear understanding of when turns are adjudicated and get reports out regularly. I also love it when people kibitz while they play. It mimics the banter of a face to face game. <br>\n<br>\nI know my background has been in pbm wargames but I've used these ideas in story driven Matrix Games (murder mystery, spy, horror, etc) and had them work.<br>\n<br>\nChris Engle<br>\nHamster Press = Engle Matrix Games                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61082/#Comment_61082" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T13:51:56+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  1:51PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2007 1:52PM by Vaxalon.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking at this now from the point of view of <a href="http://www.skyseastone.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Phases/MainPage" rel="nofollow">Phases</a>, I have explicitly laid out just the kind of constraints you're talking about.\n<ol>\n<li>You start off as a fairy.</li>\n<li>You have to add one imprint to that.</li>\n<li>That imprint can either be of a Pattern initiate, or not.</li>\n<li>If it's a pattern initiate, you get <i>this</i> thing, at <i>that</i> price.</li>\n<li>If it's not, you get <i>this other thing</i>, at <i>that other</i> price.</li>\n</ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61085/#Comment_61085" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T14:13:21+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  2:13PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred:  I've looked over your character creation stuff, and I have absolutely <b>no</b> sense that I could create a character with any degree of confidence.

But I have to admit that even when a lot of effort was put into that for the play-by-wiki projects, these projects always failed. And it's precisely for the reason that Tony cites, which is that there's relatively little social feedback on a timely basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo chargen in Universalis, so that's refering to after play starts. Tony's point is about the chargen limits, but, beyond that the same problem applies to every post. Did I go in a direction that people like? Sure, Universalis has a challenge mechanic, but in asynchronous play that's got the same problem that any feedback has - we're not sure why it's not forthcoming if it's not. Do people really not object, or are they just too busy to respond?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in practice, I think Tony has an excellent point in general that further constraint seems like a good idea. But, that said, without constraining to the point where there's no creativity left allowed, can you ever get to the point where there's no doubt as to how the other players feel about what's provided (or little enough to be comfortable)?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is worse than that. I'm currently of the belief that, in fact, thematic play is largely about the feedback you get. It's not a purely creative act, but about putting themes out there and having them validated as interesting or not. To me, if you're not getting that feedback, then there's no point to playing at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why I think that the Uni-wikis die. I don't think that, after the Tenet phases, that anybody ever produced anything that was "out of bounds" for the games we played. Instead I think the problem is that people created great stuff, but felt like they were doing it in a social vaccuum most of the time. It feels stillborn.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly I think that gamism or more purely exploratory play works a lot better in these media. Because in a gamism framework, your "score" (whatever that may be in the system at hand) stands in as an accepted social feedback. If you've attained level 60, then you know that people will respect that accomplishment. So it makes the play worthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn more simmy play, the pure act of creativity is the reward itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn narrativism play, if you don't have feedback, you don't have play, in my opinion. Such feedback does happen in PBP play, but it's so non-instant, and relatively infrequent, that it doesn't have that "shaman storytelling" effect that I think is important. At least that's been my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61283/#Comment_61283" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T06:24:05+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  6:24AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But Mike...<br><br>There are PBEM's out there that have been running successfully for YEARS AND YEARS.
