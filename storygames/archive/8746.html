Until, well, my puzzler is sore.<br/><br/>Basically, it boils down to this:<br/><br/>When you reward a behaviour, or create a mechanism, people will often become blind to the actual virtue being rewarded or the thing the mechanism supports - they just see the reward and the mechanism, and act accordingly based on those things.<br/><br/>In my head, this is the opposite of the fruitful void idea - the fruitless structure.<br/><br/>And I keep thinking "Hey, I've seen that in gaming".

Like, the natural thing for my guy to do next in an argument is to hang a threat over his enemy's head, but he sucks at <i>intimidate </i>so now I have to consider ways to get him to simply <i>persuade </i>the other side. This doesn't fit with either my vision of the conversation nor my internal model of what I feel my character is "supposed" to be good at, so there's a hiccup. But it's waaay better if you just talk it out, and an impartial mediator (the GM) tells you what to roll. The result? Just because I think my guy prefers to threaten and yell doesn't mean he's actually any good at it! Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>In some ways I like it when the mechanics shape play choices: I look at my character and see he's better at persuading than intimidating, so I play him as a smooth talker and not a tough-talker. But it seems inevitable that my personal vision of the character isn't mechanically well represented, so there's a gap between how I think things should go and how the mechanics support/deny that vision.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193454/#Comment_193454" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T14:49:16+00:00" title="February 20, 2009  2:49PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2009 3:47PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait wait wait...<br/><br/>For the record, this exactly is <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=119" rel="nofollow">The Fruitful Void</a>.<br/><br/>As Vincent writes, using <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> as an example, "The arrows are all procedural elements of the game, as you can see. What's inside the whirlwind? Inside the whirlwind is what really matters."<br/><br/>I would say the procedures are there to provoke the real reward.  What many people consider the "reward cycle" isn't the reward cycle or the reward.  It's a process you go through to get to the thing that "really matters."<br/><br/>To draw from Schwartz's example, the job of Janitor of a Hospital has many procedures, but the reward is the interaction with the people in the hospital.  The janitorial procedures allows the Janitor interact with people and make decisions about how to interact.  But interacting with people and how one chooses to interact with people, which isn't listed as a procedure, is the payoff.<br/><br/>If you just jump from procedure to procedure - paying attention to nothing else - thinking you're going to get a great payoff, you'll be disappointed.  I've noticed a bunch of posts lately about how rushing from conflict resolution to conflict resolution isn't really satisfying.  Like that.  That kind of play is the guy who thinks he's going to be satisfied as long as he's focused on his incentives at work and stops paying attention to how or why he's doing the work.<br/><br/><br/>I found the talk more relevant to the search for game designs that try to keep players from hurting each other with "social violence," "brutality" or "abuse" or whatever crazy buzzwords the kids are throwing down these days.  Schwartz's point is, and I agree, you can't force "practical wisdom" through rules or rewards -- and trying to put up guard rails to prevent people from having to learn to be practically wise via (supposedly) protective rules only absolves folks from having to pay attention to how they're actually treating other people.  If people at a table are treating each other badly,<i> they should learn to pay attention and not do that....</i> not wait for the rules to clean up their behavior.<br/><br/>But it's a different thread and I'll write something up later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193456/#Comment_193456" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T15:18:37+00:00" title="February 20, 2009  3:18PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, that's a really interesting thought train there.

It's not the important part. If people just follow the arrows round and round, and never actually put anything in the middle, yeah. Suck. I have played that game.<br/><br/>Relatedly, the function of the good kind of mechanical reinforcement of social interaction is very similar. If you want to follow the pointers, they'll make things better. If you fail to follow them, the mechanics won't support and reinforce you, so the whole thing will fall apart fast.<br/><br/>For a long time, the usual systematic response to social crap-giving was "here is how to use mechanics and GM force to deniably punish deviance". That's the suck. Having mechanics that positively leverage NON-ass behavior?

How so, or not so?</blockquote>\nVery much so.<br/><br/>The idea that mechanical incentives may make you loose sight of the real deal makes a lot of sense to me. That's what I call carrot mechanics.<br/><br/>Whether it's about extra dice or extra points or penalties of some sort, a lot of roleplaying games include mechanics aimed at making you play in a certain way because you want a reward. Most prominent are rewards for acting in accordance with certain preset characteristics (if your character is greedy, you get a reward for acting greedy), but there are many others variations.<br/><br/>Some mechanics may work that way even though they're not really meant to be carroty. For example, in order to make characters evolve naturally based on their experiences you may want to let them improve skills based on how often they use those skills during the game - but then, in Oblivion, you get people jumping everywhere they go to get a better jump skill. In pen and paper games people won't usually act that silly, but the skill improvement systems in Pendragon or Call of Cthulu or Mouse Guard may still influence players to lust for tests even in situations where a test doesn't really make the game more fun.<br/><br/>Now, I do believe that carrot mechanics may teach players how to make games more fun. Reading about stunts in Exalted made me realize that action scenes often become more exciting if you involve the scenery. I hadn't thought about that before. But now I've <i>learned</i> this, so if I want to describe a cool action scene I'll keep the scenery in mind, <i>regardless</i> of what bonuses I get from doing so. It's like training wheels on a bike. (And I would hate it if in the middle of an action scene I were to realize that right now all these chairs and rugs and chandeliers I'm introducing are contributing only extra dice, not any extra action.)<br/><br/>The problem arises when the system pushes you in a direction that you don't really feel will make the game more exciting, but that will get you a carrot. Or even when the system doesn't push you in an irritating direction, but the carrot distracts you a little from all of the cool roleplaying that is going on. That's why I don't like mechanical rewards that encourage certain player behaviours: I want the only player motivation, the only reward anyone is concerned with, to be <b>FUN</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193621/#Comment_193621" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T00:56:25+00:00" title="February 23, 2009 12:56AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Magnus.

Rewards are only as powerful as we let them be. In a game with mechanical rewards, acting without regard to the reward mechanic is a statement of character. Reward systems can be leveraged to provide fictional positioning. They're useful for a lot more than just "training wheel" effects, and it seems to me that one skill of play is to know when to ignore them. Compulsive pursuit of mechanical reward, even when fictional integrity or expression indicates otherwise, isn't a rules problem. It's a people problem.</blockquote>\nI think there's another angle to this that often goes undiscussed: Not every incentive works for every player. If the player doesn't care about killing the other guy faster, he won't be incentivized by the prospect of earning kill-the-other-guy points. If he doesn't care about taking the narrative reins of a scene, all the bribery in the world won't pull him toward actions that provide that opportunity. Then you start running into folks reinventing the games they're playing to fit the incentive scheme they need, and then you're into JD's "nobody plays by the rules anyway" territory.<br/><br/>Honestly I think incentive disconnects are a leading cause of "I don't get it" moments in RPGs.

I find it much less intrusive to have the structure of play pointing me in the right direction - so that of I just play my character with conviction, and follow the rules, I'll get where I want to be - than I do being always in the director's chair, playing up at that meta level. And I say this as someone who is in no way an "immersive" player, and is comfortable with director stance. But I like it at a more moment-to-moment, shot-to-shot pace than at a narrative-structure level. Letting the structure keep me on target so I can concentrate on portrayal is a plus for me, and makes the moments I consciously choose to defy the structure more significant.<br/><br/>But I can see that others might have different tastes in the matter. I do kind of wonder about one thing, though. You keep talking about rewards in terms of "scoring points." Do you see them as fundamentally competitive and quantitative?

I think I'm somewhere near Magnus on this.  Mechanical rewards (including XP) are there to encourage players to do stuff that you want them too; therefore, if they're already doing what you want them too, there's no need for a mechanical incentive.  Consequently, in line with this thread, I see mechanical incentives as teaching tools that are only necessary until the players have figured out what they're supposed to do and remember to do it consistently.<br/><br/>Additionally, in many games, mechanical incentives could be successfully replaced with social incentives.  Like, if you want players to... uh, always describe the crazy hairstyles that characters have, you could have a rule where, anytime someone describes their characters' hairstyle, the other players' characters have to give that character complements.  Assuming that players enjoy having their character received compliments, boom, you now have a social incentive as powerful as any mechanical incentive.<br/><br/>However, like mechanical incentives, you might want mandatory social incentives like that to fade away as the group becomes more accustomed to doing things instinctively.  After all, it might not always be appropriate for hair-compliments to be injected directly into a scene, so once players learn to describe and compliment each others' hair, you probably want to allow them more leeway to determine when it's appropriate to do so.  However, mechanical incentives can be harder to fade out than social incentives.  Take Primetime Adventures for example.  Fanmail in PTA is built into the way the token economy is calculated.  If players forget to give out fanmail, even if they are still throwing "awesome!" social rewards to the other players in the group, the game gets kinda funky, because the players might end up not having enough fanmail to spend on extra cards.<br/><br/>In other cases, if a mechanical incentive is rendered unnecessary by the play culture of the group, it can throw the play culture of the group off. For example, if you watch a bunch of experienced indie gamers sit down and play Wushu, for example, it can be really weird.  Wushu gives you a mechanical incentive for describing additional details of your characters actions, but most indie roleplayers I know have no problems with descriptions, so they describe the maximum number of details every time, which sometimes makes things strangely overblown and leads to non-essential details being described.  The social culture of a lot of indie roleplaying games already awards people for describing things in a cool or shocking way, so it doesn't really connect well with a significant portion of Wushu's mechanics.<br/><br/>Does that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193670/#Comment_193670" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T09:20:26+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  9:20AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>It does, thanks!<br/><br/>I do see that phenomenon in my play groups, so that helps. It also reinforces, for me, that the phenomenon you're talking about is culture-specific and not universal. I've also played in groups where the point of play was to chase mechanical incentives because earning them was <br/><br/>a) a form of score-keeping (which I suppose is a way to earn social validation, although by no means does one lead to the other)<br/><br/>and/or <br/><br/>b) a way to bank (hopefully) insurmountable advantages for future tactical conflicts.<br/><br/>I would hesitate to call those groups "bad" or "dysfunctional" or whatever, but their motives for play -- the stuff that incentivizes them -- is perpendicular to the motives of the play culture I think we're talking about here.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193672/#Comment_193672" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T09:28:49+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  9:28AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Paul, I was just chatting with Eric and said: "This also assumes a non-competitive play environment, where gaining mechanical incentives more often or before your opponents isn't the name of the game. Because, in those cases, yeah, you might give people social rewards for being stupid so they'll keep doing it."  You see this in poker tournaments and the like, right?  I mean, in friendly competition, it might not be that cutthroat. I've seen GMs warn their players before they make a poor tactical decision, because the GM ultimately wants the players to win the fight, making the competition more an illusion than real.  But, yes, there's definitely play cultures in which seeking mechanical incentives is the entire intent of play.<br/><br/>I still wonder whether you could simplify these games by removing most of the mechanical incentives and replacing them with Magnus-style declarations about "what play is about" and having very specific options about what the characters do (4E does this, as does Mouse Guard).  Like, you don't need an incentive for players to seek out the next encounter in D&amp;D, right?

The alternatives are not binary "chase rewards for competitive advantage" vs "we all know how to play, stop harshing our mellow."

I'm in the midst of a somewhat Getting Things Done-style overhaul of my routine, and so thinking positively of systems that are easy to set up and check without requiring constant maintenance thought or emotion. Sometimes I'm inclined to think of applying a comfortable, satisfying reward system much as I do eating meals and taking my medications regularly: in good stretches I could skip some without any harm to speak of, but I keep to the routine so that bad stretches are less likely to come along.<br/><br/>In this regard, lots of game mechanics are, for me, less about creating good stuff than about deterring the emergence of bad stuff, where "bad" means "not what we want by playing this game this way at this point".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193683/#Comment_193683" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T09:59:17+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  9:59AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or competitive-versus-the-GM.<br/><br/>I mean, consider a player who says "I have no incentive for giving anyone fan mail." I mean, <i>my mind boggles</i> at that. In fact my gut reaction is to peg that guy as an asshole. But he truly may have absolutely no incentive to hand strokes out to other players. He gains no mechanical tactical advantage, he himself is not earning social validation (or at least can't perceive that he <i>will</i>, because people will think he's cool because of his generosity), etc.<br/><br/>Mostly I'm playing the Devil's Advocate here, because I'm very much in the storygaming-style culture. But I've got good friends who have derived literally decades of fun out of competitive-style RPG play, and for them the stuff we're talking about is alien, pointless, or both.<br/><br/>Mark: I do think there's room for rewards as a pacing mechanism, but even then that assumes that pacing is important to the players. It might be important to the designer, but the folks playing may not agree. They may in fact find such a scheme directly interferes with their fun! I've got a very good friend who pegged many of these sorts of mechanisms in Burning Empires as, and I quote, "The death of fun."<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mrigashirsha" title="Mrigashirsha"><img alt="Mrigashirsha" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mrigashirsha">Mrigashirsha</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193686/#Comment_193686" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T10:13:43+00:00" title="February 23, 2009 10:13AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul B: I find my life much happier since I started giving up more. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But seriously, I have friends who really, really thrive on highly competitive roleplaying who have an insane sort of fun that's glorious to watch. They don't spare one inch of mercy for themselves any more than they do for each other when they play, and it's fascinating to see. But it's also true that I have somewhere close to precisely zero to say to them as an author or player, and that they have very little to offer me apart from the fun of any art practiced well.

Following the rules should itself be rewarding in a game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I think that's certainly true of games with an element of chance. There's also the game form where the psychological pleasure (probably) arises from pattern recognition and pattern completion -- Chess, Go, etc.</blockquote>\nAlright then, this is the <i>other</i> psychological root of why we play games in the first place :P\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>On that same note, I think combining intermittent rewards with pattern completion is where you get mega-addictive games like Tetris, Bejeweled, etc.</blockquote>\nFor me, pattern completion is the reason I enjoy those games in the first place.<br/><br/>Hmm..<br/><br/>Perhaps there's some grand illusion going on here, where play is the actual reward, but we need to be tricked into it with a Scooby Snack.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I'm not sure RPGs have tapped into that yet. If such a game existed, could that support the fiction-making at the core of RPGs or would it be a distraction?</blockquote>\nD&amp;D already taps straight into this kind of play, and ends up being a distraction IMHO. However, that has more to do with the <i>kinds</i> of patterns being completed than the completion itself.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Magnus</cite>It's like training wheels on a bike.</blockquote>\nI JUST used exactly the same analogy to describe FATE points in FATE recently.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Mechanical rewards (including XP) are there to encourage players to do stuff that you want them too; therefore, if they're already doing what you want them too, there's no need for a mechanical incentive.</blockquote>\nIndeed. The only thing left is the play itself, which is what I'm there for.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Consequently, in line with this thread, I see mechanical incentives as teaching tools that are only necessary until the players have figured out what they're supposed to do and remember to do it consistently.</blockquote>\nUnless of course the incentives become the <i>reason</i> for play, and reduce actual play into a soulless repetitive exercise.<br/><br/>Slot Jockeys don't enjoy continually pulling the lever. In fact, they often turn off emotionally and work like robots. That's the <i>last</i> thing we want in an RPG though. Ironically, they are also usually more driven in play than someone who enjoys pulling the lever for its own sake, committing that action more often and vigorously. But that enthusiasm for play is an illusion, and the opposite of what a good RPG should be encouraging.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Additionally, in many games, mechanical incentives could be successfully replaced with social incentives.</blockquote>\nWell, as long as all the players involved are skilled at engaging with others socially, as opposed to engaging with the rules mechanically.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>However, like mechanical incentives, you might want mandatory social incentives like that to fade away as the group becomes more <b>accustomed to doing things instinctively</b>.</blockquote>\nThis is what I meant when I said a good session should work like a Ouija board.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>In other cases, if a mechanical incentive is rendered unnecessary by the play culture of the group, it can throw the play culture of the group off. For example, if you watch a bunch of experienced indie gamers sit down and play Wushu, for example, it can be really weird.</blockquote>\nIn fact, this kind of thing can render what was meant to be a game, not a game. The players have just become too good at it for the rewards to be rewarding. You could even say that these indie gamers you mention have <i>outgrown</i> Wushu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194062/#Comment_194062" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T04:10:53+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  4:10AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite><br/>Does that resonate with you?

Or am I missing something?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195464/#Comment_195464" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T10:46:59+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 10:46AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I just ask Marshall and Simon if they have ever played Shadow of Yesterday?

In my experience, playing a game tells me a lot more and often dispells misaprehensions I had. So, have you guys played the game?

So does PTA for that matter. Keys in TSOY and issues in PTA are similar to kickers in Sorcerer -- the player creates something they're interested in and the GM draws on that for inspiration.

I can't get really interested in conch-passing storytelling games either, the ones where I'm supposed to be responsible for creating a good story. As far as I'm concerned, I want the rules mechanics to take care of that part so I can focus on playing my character / throwing nasty stuff at the player characters or whatever other fun things there are in the game to be done. "Making a story" is not on my list of fun things for roleplaying simply because when I want to make a story, I write one.<br/><br/>Looking at TSoY in this context, though, the xp rules of the game work very well in giving me what I want: instead of me the player getting more control over the fiction the xp gives my character more control over his environment, his fate, his society, his friends and enemies - which in turn directly drives frozen conflicts of his life towards resolution now that he finally has the power to do something about it. Considering that TSoY is an epic hero game (as opposed to something like <i>Sorcerer</i>), this is exactly what we want to happen in the game - we want characters to change and find their path to power so they get to be in those epic narrativist moments where they have the power to make genuine choices they couldn't before. "When last we met, old man, you were the master and I was the pupil" and all that sort of stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195623/#Comment_195623" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T10:07:32+00:00" title="March  5, 2009 10:07AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>which in turn directly drives frozen conflicts of his life towards resolution now that he finally has the power to do something about it. </i><br/><br/>Ok, <i>that's</i> interesting.
