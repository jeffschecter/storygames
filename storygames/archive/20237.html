At the end of each scene, all players are free to move their token to a field that resonates most with them. This a simple informal way to inform and inspire each other where the story or the game should go.<br/>Additionally, a concentration of tokens on a specific field indicates that there might be a need in the group that needs attention.<br/>If players feel something important is missing on the compass, they are free to add an additional field that represents what is important to them.<br/><br/>Feedback &amp; experience so far has been very positive. Let me know if you think something like this could be useful in your game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445949/#Comment_445949" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-04T05:16:54+00:00" title="July  4, 2015  5:16AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting!<br/><br/>But does something like "Action" mean you want more of that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445950/#Comment_445950" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-04T05:17:06+00:00" title="July  4, 2015  5:17AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting!<br/><br/>But does something like "Action" mean you want more of that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445955/#Comment_445955" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-04T19:57:51+00:00" title="July  4, 2015  7:57PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul: Exactly. However, basically the spaces can mean whatever you want, as long as you all agree on it.<br/><br/>Here is an explanation of the specific spaces (again, feel free to use whatever you want, of course):<br/>\u2022 I'm ok - Choose this if you are overall content with how things evolve for you as a player as well as the overall<br/>story.<br/>\u2022 I need break - This you as as the player expressing a need. Feel free to get up and leave the space if you need<br/>to. You should feel comfortable being involved in the game.<br/>\u2022 Speed up - You would like the overall pace of the game to go faster. Less time should be wasted in details for<br/>you and the story should move forward.<br/>\u2022 Take more time - Storyplaying is rushing too fast for your taste. You would like to take more time and pay<br/>attention to the details.<br/>\u2022 Roleplaying - You would like to spend more time roleplaying, immersed in the scenes immersed in-character.<br/>\u2022 Plotting - You would like to spend more time scheming plots, advance character development and talking<br/>about where the story is potentially going.<br/>\u2022 Action - You would like to see more action scenes.<br/>\u2022 Dialogue - You would like to see scenes based on intense, interesting dialoues.<br/>\u2022 Stability - At the moment, continuity within the story without too many suprises or abrupt incidents is<br/>important to you.<br/>\u2022 Twist - You would like to see a game changing twist in the story.<br/>\u2022 Intimate - At the moment, you would like to see scenes with a focus on a few characters in a more intimate setting.<br/>\u2022 Epic - At the moment, you would like to see things happening on a grand scale, at least relative to your story.<br/>\u2022 Light - Within the story margins, you would like to roleplay scenes a bit more light-hearted. Perhaps, you<br/>prefer less dramatic things at stake in the scenes.<br/>\u2022 Dark - Within the story margins, you would like the scenes to get grittier. Roleplaying should be probably more<br/>tense or dramatic for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445959/#Comment_445959" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-04T21:54:19+00:00" title="July  4, 2015  9:54PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445961/#Comment_445961" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-05T02:10:57+00:00" title="July  5, 2015  2:10AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is cool; I like it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445974/#Comment_445974" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-05T14:04:08+00:00" title="July  5, 2015  2:04PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a lovely idea, but I doubt I'll ever get to use it: my groups would laugh me out the room for being wildly oversensitive. Perhaps it's a culture thing? I feel that if a group was intimate enough to use this tool, they probably wouldn't have a problem with calling for breaks or openly discussing the strengths or weaknesses of a scene, or what they want to come next. <br/><br/>Is there a slightly more soft-ball version of this? Like a unobtrusive call-and-response round after each scene - GM quickly ask if people need <i>breaks, speed it up, slow it down, tension, pathos, humour</i>, and the players give their best auctioneer's nods to submit their votes on each. Majority nod for humour? Time for a light-hearted scene after that grizzly murder. I dunno - doing away with the prop element is the only way I'm going to get this to fly with grizzled Yorkshiremen.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446011/#Comment_446011" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-07T20:25:04+00:00" title="July  7, 2015  8:25PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a person in my life that I had trouble standing up to.

So I wrote "arguing notes", pre-written little text cards that said things like "Maybe we should slow down right now" or "I don't know if it's your intent, but you're making me feeel really bad".<br/>However... the tiny window of "being too shy to speak up but being brave enough to pass a note" is such a sliver. Formulating the phrases and putting them on paper helped me become braver and speak up more often. So I threw the notes away and started speaking up -- I don't always dare to do it but in those cases, I would've had a hard time with the notes as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446015/#Comment_446015" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T03:30:16+00:00" title="July  8, 2015  3:30AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "I'm okay" space seems like dead weight to me, and I don't like the shadow it casts on the other spaces.

For me it would feel socially safer to put my token somewhere if I didn't have to imply dissatisfaction. A space that says "surprise me," or "I'm good with whatever" could work, but I think it would work better without the neutral option.<br/><br/>Recently I've been recently doing this type of thing (less formally, and less frequently), by asking "what do we want to see more of?" I've had better results framing this as a positive ("what would be exciting to you", rather than "what do you wish would change") since people are reluctant to complain or to seem like they're complaining.<br/><br/>Love that this enables that negotiation quickly and quietly between scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446017/#Comment_446017" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T08:19:17+00:00" title="July  8, 2015  8:19AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">@Potemkin</a>.

Because of this, maybe the fields could be clearly paired up and perhaps people could have two or three tokens to communicate their feelings about multiple pairs.<br/><br/>I can see this being useful for playing online, because of the lack of face-to-face feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446018/#Comment_446018" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T08:26:58+00:00" title="July  8, 2015  8:26AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But the previous version had them paired up, Ricardo.<br/>Maybe there's some benefit to decoupling them.<br/>Such as when Lojban (a dorky language) was being developed, originally most descriptive predicates were comparative. "blanu" which means that something is blue, for a while meant "something is bluer than something else". you'd say "lo kanla cu blanu lo tsani" which would mean "your eyes are bluer than the sky". The idea was scrapped and now blanu just means "is blue". I'm happy about that change: predicate relationships don't have to be binary, not everything is a contest.<br/>(Lojban is pretty good about distinguishing between scalar and polar negation, as well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446031/#Comment_446031" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T12:00:44+00:00" title="July  8, 2015 12:00PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The "I'm okay" space seems like dead weight to me, and I don't like the shadow it casts on the other spaces. </blockquote>\nThis seems smart.<br/><br/>But I can also imagine not having the "I'm okay" space causing issues - if you're just enjoying the game, now you have to stop and think about where to put your token.

Flow ebbs, time "off the ball" and specific breaks are useful; checking with players to reaffirm the direction of flow and consolidate progress feels a whole lot more natural to storytelling, conversation and human sociability than pushing a token about to ask for a loo break. <br/><br/>Apologies if my tone seems belittling at all: your invention is lovely and I'm sure many people will find it useful, but I'm not one of them. I mostly want to hear the players own vocalisations of what they need and I'm content to pause the flow to find out.<br/><br/> Perhaps it's a culture-thing? I'm from that stock of hard-bitten British grognards who've been mercilessly hardwired to grab any shed of player vocalisation they can. Subtly and sensitivity aren't virtues that characterise many folk I play with. Game-mastery is all about managing multiple voices for me; your tool would be more effective for my table just as a list of options players can quickly choose from, but I wouldn't be worth my while to insult their intelligence to that degree.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446182/#Comment_446182" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T04:56:16+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  4:56AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Potemkin: yes, it can definitely be a culture thing.
