It's likely that these will be answered by watching Jenn's <a href="http://projectnpt.com/qa/" rel="nofollow">Q&amp;A session</a> or her <a href="http://projectnpt.com/demo/" rel="nofollow">Actual Play</a>. For right now, though, I can't watch those things and another format for questions &amp; answers can't hurt.<br/><br/>So, my first question is...what does play <b>look like</b> in the game? What do I do on my turn? On page 28, "Game Play: Rounds", we get this description:<br/><br/><i>The game is played in three rounds with each player taking a turn as the Mastermind. This means you will be a Mastermind three times. You will also be a nemesis three times. Think of all the plans you can accomplish! Minions! I suggest listening to the Masterminds as they are smarter and more evil than you. Remember to use your toolbelt when helping with a plan and always cheer loudly when you help a Mastermind succeed. Having more toolbelt items is good for business and the Minion with the most toolbelt items at the end can become a Mastermind of their very own. Masterminds, now you\u2019re ready to conquer the world. Remember there are only 3 rounds of play and once completed you must return to the International League of Masterminds. If you are unable to complete your three-step plan during the 3 rounds I suggest you try your darnedest to stifle the plans of your Nemeses. At the end of the game you will be asked to count the number of project cards you have completed and the number of qualities remaining. Each card is worth two points and each quality is worth one point. The Mastermind with the most number of points will take over the world. If there is a tie the Mastermind who thwarted the most plans (project cards won as a Nemesis) wins. Ruling the world takes cunning and decisive plans. Never underestimate your Nemesis and watch out for those Minions. Go now and try to rule the world, and do not come back until you are finished!<br/></i><br/><br/>What do I do on my turn? It says there are three rounds of play, and I'm supposed to complete my three-step plan. How, though? Am I narrating my plan?<br/><br/>It says earlier, page 24, under "Game Play: Mastermind Turn", that the Minions decide who to support: the Mastermind or the Nemesis, then throw their token in the middle of the table. The Mastermind &amp; Nemesis each roll Fudge dice, adding tokens in their favor as +1s. If the Mastermind wins they take a project card and give the Minions a toolbelt item (is this something made up on the spot, or does it come from a Quality?). If the Nemesis wins they discard a project card from play, essentially counting it as a point in their favor.<br/><br/>But...where does the fiction come in? Do we narrate things at all, or speak in character, or...? As presented in the text, it seems like what we're doing is writing a bunch of fun and wacky things on cards and character sheets (cool), trying to get minions on our side by maybe speaking in-character a little bit, rolling dice, collecting a card with a wacky plan on it, and then going to someone else's turn.<br/><br/>I just want to make sure I'm not missing something! It seems like maybe I might be.<br/><br/>Oh, you know what? Page 47. The summary of Playing the Game. That says how to play. I get it. So I narrate how I'm undertaking the next step of my plan (a Project card that's been turned over) using one of my Qualities. I persuade the Minions by offering a new toolbelt item. Nemesis describes how she's trying to stop my plan. Nemesis persuades Minions. Minions vote, we roll dice. This step of the project is completed or not, depending on the roll.<br/><br/>The questions that remain:<br/><br/>1. Do we narrate the outcome of this step of the project after we roll dice? Like, if I'm the Mastermind and I win, it's all, "And my evil Nemesis, Dr. Octagonacologist, attempted to thwart Project Taco by poisoning the meat but my Meat Ray just filled all the tacos back up as soon as he tainted them! The world is in love with my tacos."?<br/><br/>2. Are the Minion Toolbelt Items something that the Mastermind &amp; Nemisis create on the fly during play?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jennisodes" title="Jennisodes"><img alt="Jennisodes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jennisodes">Jennisodes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401089/#Comment_401089" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T13:19:13+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  1:19PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi <br/>As the Mastermind you are narrating the step of the plan (on your first turn it will be the 1st step and if you succeed then on your next mastermind turn (Round 2) you'll be able to try for step 2) using 1 quality and the word on the card. Then you persuade the Minions to help you by offering them a new toolbelt item. This item can pertain to your plan. (This is created on the fly during play). <br/><br/>The Nemesis then describes how she is going to stop your plan using one of their qualities. They persuade the Minions by offering them a different toolbelt item that is awesome and can pertain to their plan or quality. I tried to give the players room for their imaginations to flow and be silly and crazy coming up with ideas. <br/><br/>Minions vote using voting tokens. Each vote gives a +1 to the roll. Each Minion describes how they are going to help the person they voted for using one of their toolbelt items. (In the beginning you only have 1 toolbelt item but during play you get more so then you have more choices!)<br/><br/>Then the Mastermind and Nemesis each roll 4 fudge dice and add any votes given to them. You can narrate the outcome of the step if you'd like but it is not required in the rules. Depending on how much your group likes to roleplay and narrate feel free to add it in. <br/><br/>I hope this answers your questions!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401092/#Comment_401092" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T13:34:54+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  1:34PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jenn, that's crystal.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
