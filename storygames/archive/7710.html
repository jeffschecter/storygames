We got together two weeks ago to define our setting (Paris 1993), flesh it out some (creating a few locations of note as well as describing the supernatural powers that be) and making characters.<br/><br/>Our first game was this Sunday.  I haven\u2019t talked to the other players to find out if they are comfortable with me using their names, so for this post I\u2019ll use character names and we\u2019ll see what the players think for future endeavors.<br/><br/>Cast:<br/>Storyteller<br/>Francois (me)<br/>Iron Fur<br/>Uri<br/>Sonya<br/>Richard<br/>Pale Fist / Bobby<br/>Worm<br/><br/>Our goal was to introduce our characters, go through our first change, form a pack and then pick a totem.<br/><br/>What rocked:<br/><br/>The first change.  We had short vignettes of each character before they changed doing something traumatic.  One lupus (born wolf) was challenged for primacy of his pack, one got shot by a cop, and another got into a fight with bears.  Of the homids (born human) we had gang violence, nearly being taken out by a SWAT team, overdosing on heroin, and having your masterpiece defaced by peers.  Each of these scenes were charged with a lot of emotional energy and made for great lead-ins to our first changes.<br/><br/>The storyteller had each of us play NPC characters (most of whom would die) in each other\u2019s scenes to antagonize the PC until he thought the PC was going to loose it and then would call \u201cRAGE\u201d and move onto the next character.   After he had described all of our changes, he went back and allowed the player to narrate the rest of their first change.<br/><br/>We didn\u2019t roll any dice, we just acted out what made sense.  The wolf bites you, I shoot it, etc. and had a great time playing up ridiculous French accents.  The gore level was very satisfactory and each scene was very telling about what was important to the new cub.<br/><br/>My character had no say whatsoever in who became Alpha.  I\u2019m playing a Bone Gnawer (the absolute runts of Werewolf society), so it is totally fitting that my character\u2019s opinion would never be consulted.  See below, however for how the selection didn\u2019t work.<br/><br/>What could have been improved:<br/><br/>Having done it again, I would have asked the storyteller to let the player call \u201cRAGE\u201d when they wanted to.  In my case I really wanted to go further before my character has his first change.  I had envisioned him getting into a fight that he couldn\u2019t handle and the scene was less intense than I was expecting.  On the other hand there was a scene for the Uri when he was fighting two bears where it seemed like he didn\u2019t have much to do until the first change happened, so he was waiting a bit.  The scenes played out fine but I think they could have found more intensity is the player was the one to call out for their first change.<br/><br/>The totem picking processes was long and arduous.  It didn\u2019t feel at all in keeping with the spirit of the game.  We all did blind votes for totems, eliminating ones we few or no votes until there were just a few to pick from.  There is nothing democratic, nor nearly that political about Werewolf, so for me this just felt inappropriate.  We\u2019re done with it now, but were it possible, I\u2019d try to devise some kind of mini-game to choose totems. I\u2019m thinking something along the lines of Dual of Wits to establish who can pick the totem and the concessions that winner makes limits his choices.  This would fit well with the \u201cI am the leader, I choose, but I choose on behalf of my pack\u201d mentality that Werewolf is all about.  I don\u2019t fault the storyteller for this, it is just an awkward part of the game.<br/><br/>What I didn\u2019t like:<br/><br/>Our alpha was picked for us, in a somewhat arbitrary manner.  I think the storyteller didn\u2019t want to game to drag into one endless contest of the characters asserting dominance over each other, but frankly the very first thing werewolves would do is establish a pecking order.  I know its very non-plot advancing but I think it does worlds for character development.  The trick is to keep the conflicts short and bring them down to the dice.  \u201cOkay, neither of you like each other, you fight, make some rolls, winner asserts dominance, done.\u201d  The rolls could be social, physical or whatever was appropriate.  I definitely understand the desire to keep it fast (i.e. not go into actual combat as it takes too long) but I think some simple rolls to determine who wins would have done it.  You let the looser narrate the first part and the winner narrates the end, and you call it done.  If we had a few of those conflicts I think an alpha would have emerged of the player\u2019s election.   As is the result was that at one point one of the characters had the majority of the pack paying attention to him, so he became the pack leader.  The decision was made by the Storyteller based on this criteria: Most of the pack was paying attention to him and he had resources to provide a home and food for the pack.  Yep, those are good things to have in a leader, but as my character said \u201cI would have liked to see more blood on his claws\u201d. <br/><br/>-Sean                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171273/#Comment_171273" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T12:48:14+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 12:48PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, sounds interesting. <br/><br/>1) With the alpha thing, is there a way for the players to re-assert who is the alpha later on?

He left it open. As the pack changes, the Alpha may as well.  However as soon as the Alpha is established he has a huge advantage over any potential and that is that a) the philidox of the group must agree that the challenge is legitimate (no challenging for alpha on the grounds of him not showering often enough), then they must go through the beta, and in both challenges the challenger gets to set the contest.  It's a rough ladder to climb.  All of which may be totally awesome to play out mind you, but if there were players who wanted to make a grab for Alpha early, they are going to have a long road ahead of them.<br/><br/>2. Yes, we're all from different areas, tribes, breeds, etc. Here is the breakdown as much as I remember it:<br/><br/>Cast:<br/>Francois - Homid - Ahroun - Bone Gnawer<br/>Iron Fur - Lupis - Philidox - Get of Fenris <br/>Uri - Lupis - Theurge - Wendigo<br/>Sonya - Homid - Galliard - Silver Fang<br/>Richard - Homid - Ragabash - Glass Walker (Alpha)<br/>Pale Fist / Bobby - Lupis - Theurge - Red Talon<br/>Worm - Homid - Ragabash - Glass Walker<br/><br/>After our first changes (which we played out together but didn't involve any of the same characters) the Storyteller narrated all of the characters traveling to Paris (about half of them were already there) and being trained by their tribe as a werewolf.  The would be pack was all sent to a moot (a werewolf ritual gathering) and told by some elder "You are the questing pack of Paris.  Figure out what the hell that means to you."   That was the context for us all working together.  The one challenge was the Red Talon but the player was pretty aware of the problem with Red Talons and... well pretty much anyone but other Red Talons so he made him the runt of his Tribe, a total outcast sent to spy on humans because he gets along with them so well (the context being that the character is a big stoner and he likes humans because they introduced him to pot).<br/><br/>3. A large portion of the group really loves the setting material for WtA, much more so than WtF.  The game is epic, the challenges are usually more black and white, and the world is immersed in real history.  My hope was that we could use the old setting but port it to the new mechanics, but the majority of the group just wanted to try it as is.  We might still switch over once the agony of four rolls with varying difficulty vs. one roll with a fixed difficulty sets in, but we'll see.<br/><br/>-Sean                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner" title="Sean Nittner"><img alt="Sean Nittner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner">Sean Nittner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171382/#Comment_171382" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T21:49:31+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  9:49PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The storyteller read my response and wanted to correct my response to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  He's applied to join the forum, but in the mean time here is the correction.\n<blockquote>The alpha may be challenged at ANY time for ANY reason, so long as the pack is not officially at war (as decided by the pack/tribe/caern).  So yeah, you can challenge him cause he doesn't shower enough.  However, the challenge TYPE must be approved by the pack challenge master.  The pack challenge master can allow any type of challenge, but may lose wisdom for allowing weird challenges through (like: Banana cream pies at 10 paces, whoever has the least on them, wins!) .  The wisdom loss depends on tribe/affiliation (for instance, in the above, some bone gnawers and random interrupts(gw camp), might not lose wisdome for that.  A Child of Gaia may lose some wisdom for allowing a trial by combat.)<br/><br/>Also, the beta is SUPPOSED to be the buffer, but doesn't HAVE to be.  You won't be killed or something for letting someone through.  You'll lose honor, yeah.  But if the pack leader sucks and you, as beta, let a challenge through, you may actually gain wisdom. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven" title="buffaloraven"><img alt="buffaloraven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven">buffaloraven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171487/#Comment_171487" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T11:01:25+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 11:01AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I may mangle Churchill:  It's the worst form of totem picking except all the others that have been tried.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the minigame concept, except for the part where players who have spent points in totem may feel gipped if they have little/no say in it, even if the player who wins says that it is the best for the group.  Heck, I know players(some in our games) that would still be pissed even if it was their totem!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem boils down to that you are asking every player to invest in a group item, basically.  Doing that, and then denying them the ability to influence what totem is picked, has led to issues in the past, including purposefully breaking bans, reworking starting characters so that they have no totem points, and otherwise not functioning as a team.<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely agree that it doesn't feel very werewolfie, but I haven't managed to come up with something that lets everyone feel that investing in totem is smart and keeps everyone happy.

The totem is picked. Should the pack loose the totem, this is how I would resolve picking the next one, with the focus here on two priorities a) keeping the players happy and b) keeping with the fiction.<br/><br/>The mark of a good Alpha is how much strength he brings to the group.  He can therefore gain or loose renown by making good or bad decisions.  He must consult each member of his pack (either independently or as a group) and find out what would strengthen them as a whole.  He asks for their opinions and each member of the pack grants a boon to a totem and a bane to another (any totem of their choice).  Mechanically speaking the each player's boon and bane are worth a number of renown equal to their totem background.  Thus if Fran\xe7ois has a Totem of 2, and he grants a boon to Coyote, there are two points of renown on the line for the Alpha.  Once all the boons and banes are picked, the Alpha may select any totem he chooses, however there are these ramifications:<br/><br/>1. If he chooses a totem that is neither the boon nor the bane of any pack member, he looses 1 honor and 5 wisdom for not consulting his pack.  The rest of the pack all looses 1 glory for being cowed by their alpha.<br/>2. If he chooses a totem that has a bane, he looses twice the renown that was placed on the totem in both honor and wisdom, and the pack member that chose the totem looses two glory. The pack has not worked well together and it shows. This is a major incentive not to choose a bane totem.<br/>3. If he picks a totem that has a boon he gains glory equal to the renown placed on the boon and each of the pack members who picked that totem also gains one glory.  The pack makes impressed their Alpha and he has served his pack well by following their sound advice.<br/>4. Finally, so long as he chooses a totem with the most boons (or tied for the most) and no banes, he grants each of his pack one point of renown based on the nature of the totem (War gives glory, respect gives honor, Wisdom gives wisdom). Again, the pack as a whole benefits for being of one mind.<br/><br/>Here is the cookie you're going to give the players who are not the alpha.  After all of the Banes and Boons are cast but before the Alpha chooses, any wolf can switch their boon (but not bane).  Therefore if someone else granted a boon to a totem spirit that sounds pretty good to you and you think the Alpha might pick it (especially if there is a lot of renown on the line) you can switch your boon to match theirs. <br/><br/>Finally, if anyone is really unhappy with the choice, they challenge the alpha.  Not for his position, but for the right to choose.  The victor of this challenge gains some small bit of renown, the looser looses some and you return to the rules above to grant renown to whoever does pick with the exception that if someone besides the alpha ends up picking the totem they don't get renown for their own boons.<br/><br/>This is just a rough idea but I feel it better reflects the role of the pack and the alpha.  They advise, he chooses.  If he chooses well, the pack benefits, if he chooses poorly, the pack suffers and he may be challenged.  Also, the numbers are just suggestions; you could tweak them around to fit better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven" title="buffaloraven"><img alt="buffaloraven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven">buffaloraven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171570/#Comment_171570" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T15:03:09+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  3:03PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...I'm trying to rate this on where it could go.

I'm fine with the discussion, but not sure if this is the correct forum for continuing it.  If anyone is reading this discussion and has an opinion, please voice it.  I'm happy to take the discussion offline into email but I'll continue it here if anyone has anything to add or is curious about the future of the game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buffaloraven</cite>I think your perception of the alpha is a lot more powerful than mine. He's more...a sergeant of a platoon, in my view, and in yours s/he seems more like a general. </blockquote> I break it down to medieval Roman vs. German law.  Both of the military examples a largely Roman based position of authority.  That is to say the authority comes from the office one holds, not how well they govern.  My view of the Alpha is based on the Germanic tradition, where the chief leads his clan because he has the strength to control them, the loyalty to provide for them and the wisdom to prevent them from doing anything stupid.  He is respected for his individual merits rather than because he has a station.  Similarly, the value of each member of the tribe is too high to loose anyone. So where as the Roman model of punishment might include being imprisoned, sold to slavery, or made an outcast, Germanic law called for a price to be paid for crimes, if not by you then by your kin, so that the clan\u2019s numbers stayed strong.  That is basically how I relate to Werewolf.  In this role, the alpha makes the first and last call, but he better make a good one or he won\u2019t be alpha for long.  I think the position would be a very stressful one if we were playing a more serious game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buffaloraven</cite>I worry that giving backlash to a player who chose something as a bane may make people less likely to invest in totem. </blockquote> You could certainly remove that backlash if you want (it wouldn\u2019t harm the system) but the point of it was to reinforce to the Alpha, that when he makes a bad decision he hurts not only himself but the entire pack.  You could also spread it out (-1 glory to everyone, but I already did that for another situation).  My expectation is that this will very strongly urge the player towards making a decision that will make the rest of his pack happy.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buffaloraven</cite>I worry that allowing someone to choose one that was given a bane, especially if a bane can only be given to 1 totem per player, may make some players really unhappy. </blockquote> You could allow more than one bane of you wanted, but honestly I don\u2019t think it is necessary.  The Alphas reasonably choices are very few, if he picks one that isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s boon, he\u2019s boned, so really the only totems players need to worry about is ones that work <em>really</em> well for one and <em>really</em> crappy for another.  <br/><br/>In both cases your concerns are really good ones.  How might this piss off players, make them less invested in the game, and less exited about the totem?  I certainly can\u2019t guarantee that you won\u2019t have someone that is disappointed, but this is where players should be able to voice their concerns out of game \u201cOkay, I know I didn\u2019t put a bane on Toad, but for my character appearance is really important, please don\u2019t pick that one, it will jack my day.\u201d  This is a pretty reasonable thing for people to say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven" title="buffaloraven"><img alt="buffaloraven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven">buffaloraven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171581/#Comment_171581" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T15:52:38+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  3:52PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how to do your fancy posted bys, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywho, let's keep it going on here until someone says otherwise?  I'm sure its an interesting read anyway. ;)  Also, I'm not seeing this as a debate of what went wrong, but rather how to fix it, and in that respect, I think it might be a good thing to have on here?  The idea of players and gms ironing out the kinks of a game together and collaboratively.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn't going so much for the reasons why people hold their power, more to the extent of the power they hold.  In my opinion, a general has a lot more decree-type authority (you will do this!)  and I see that being more the province of tribal elders and Silver Fang kings.  I see the pack leader as more the sergeant role:  The one that tells you that it's time to go over the top, and then leads the way into the situation, but doesn't tell you to shine your shoes (unless an officer is around).  I think that's mainly because that's the type of pack leaders I've seen played (more 'do what you want on your own time, but when the situation is rough, I'm in charge.')  I've also seen the one who tried to grab too much power get deposed fast (the alpha says, 'we're going to this meeting in Crinos.'  The lupus who doesn't like Crinos says no, battle ensues, the alpha loses, new alpha)  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou're right in that last sentence, about people seeming reasonable if they said that, however, in our circle, we have a number of conflict avoiders who would rather their day be jacked than possibly start a conflict.  Which is on them, but at the same time, on us as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner" title="Sean Nittner"><img alt="Sean Nittner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner">Sean Nittner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171586/#Comment_171586" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T16:04:50+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  4:04PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Use the little quote link at the top to be all fancy like yours truely.<br/><br/>Ahh.. I get what you mean about power now.  And yeah, I agree.  The game will absolutely suck if there is one player telling everyone else how to tie their shoes (or whether to wear shoes for that matter).  We want a leader not a micro manager.  This is going to come out in play style though. Whether you tell people this is how Alphas lead or not, some players are just going to try and exert more authority than others.  Pretty normal in game and sadly, pretty normal in life as well.  Referencing our other discussion, I think a bossy alpha is a perfect opportunity for a conflict, you just have to set the stakes to not be about whether the alpha gets his way or not, but to be about whether he looks like a good leader or not.  Look at all the times Mal bosses his crew around.  The issue really isn't if they follow his orders, but if they respect him afterwards.   Do that and I think overly bossy alphas will back down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
