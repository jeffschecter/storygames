So I have just a couple of minutes to scrawl this down.  But if I don't do it now, I'll forget and never do it.<br/><br/>I taught Versus mode over lunch today.  My fellow player has been around RPGs but he isn't really a gamer.  However, he left me <a href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/2007/09/21/sons-of-liberty-playtest/#comment-19435" rel="nofollow">a comment</a> on my blog indicating his desire to give it a whirl.  So we did.<br/><br/>We ended up playing with a loose turn structure so that he could get a feel for how the game works, which went well.  And boy did we have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>In this corner, Thomas Paine (played by Jeremy).<br/><br/>In this corner, George Washington (played by Seth).<br/><br/>The issue:  censorship.<br/><br/>The actual issue text:<br/><br/>"In New England farms, the People consider censorship.  Supporters teach correspondence after detractors replace an arms cache!"<br/><br/>Now, oddly enough, I just realized that I completely reversed this in my head when we played.  "Supporter" meant "favored freedom of the press".  Oh well.  It worked out anyways.<br/><br/>I suggested that the issue was that there were still Tories doing nasty Tory things who were being rounded up.  But the new government was suppressing the publication of texts describing the rounding up of these Tories.  Need to protect the security of the nation and all that.  (Any correlation to modern-day events is purely in your head.  Really.)<br/><br/>So Thomas Paine stood to speak against the suppression and George Washington argued for it.<br/><br/>Without replicating the entirety of play, let's just say that things quickly went from bad to worse for Paine.  He tried to implicate Washington as a Tory sympathizer, even producing photographic evidence of secret meetings between Washington and the Tories.  But Congress wasn't paying any attention, and Washington just ran roughshod over Paine.  At one point, Jeremy was locked out of cards after I had a significant base of cards on my own side of the table, so I romped all over him.  Washington had Paine thrown out of Congress and kicked him when no one was looking.  Then he led the troops out to round up the remaining Tories.  Capitalizing on this, he launched a campaign for President, which he won in a landslide.  Then he had Paine imprisoned for the win.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, Paine wrote his memoirs, but he quickly realized that no one would read them.  So, when he was finally released from jail, he retired to the obscurity of private life.  Washington, who was by then the Emperor of the United States, made sure that the few copies of Paine's memoirs were suppressed.  Bad for security, you know.<br/><br/>And all this, even with the slower card play, in about 45 minutes.<br/><br/>So, yay!<br/><br/>Playtest comments <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24959.0" rel="nofollow">are at the Forge</a>, but I thought that I'd share here, too.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99625/#Comment_99625" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T18:38:57+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  6:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seth, that sounds awesome.

The game certainly can't emulate England's Glorious Revolution or the French Revolution (although some day I will make my French Revolution game).

And, since I'm me, my answer is in two parts.<br/><br/>First, no, I don't think that the game will translate well to another country's history.  The game is all about celebrating the mythos of the Founding Fathers, and there's a certain American feel to it.  I'm not trying to be a cultural imperialist here.  It's kinda like Unknown Armies, which is another game that rests heavily on American presuppositions.  British and German players have enjoyed the game, but there's a conceptual leap that needs to be made.<br/><br/>At the same time, the rules text lays out everything that you really need to know about the various Figures to be able to play the game.  After all, it's not really about the history of the American Revolution; it's about the myth of the Revolution, which is a different thing.  So, even if you don't know anything about American history, you should still be able to learn enough from the game text to be able to enjoy the game quite well.<br/><br/>And who knows?  Maybe you'll get some insight into the <a href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/2007/09/27/a-request-for-a-replacement-term/" rel="nofollow">collective psyche</a> of America.  Which could be a scary thing, actually.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
