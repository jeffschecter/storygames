                    Some of you may know I'm working to create a periodical very much like Daedalus in spirit if not also in name. It would take the form of online content in many forms and also print format via POD sources like Lulu. The sole emphasis is actual play, or "Make Play Better."<br/><br/>I'd like to collect some feedback from you to help shape my thinking on a some of this, so here are some questions for you:
<ul><li>Have you read at least 1 article of Daedalus or a similar 'zine? More than 1?<br/></li><li>Would you pay for a softcover "annual" (1-3 issues per year) of articles, even if they were freely available online? If not, what would you expect in a print volume to be worth paying for? Would you SUBSCRIBE to such an issue?</li>
<li>What do you think of advertisements? On the web? In print?</li>
<li>If you are a publisher, would you purchase ads on a website and/or print publication? Assuming a reasonable level of audience, would you be willing to pay up to $30 per ad per issue?</li>
<li>Would you be willing to write articles and assign rights to such a publication for a small fee ($15)?</li>
<li>Can you provide any other ideas or feedback?</li></ul> </div>

                            1. No.<br/>2. Yes, and I would subscribe, if it were an actual paper product. I have little interest in online 'zines.<br/>3. Advertisements are the devil's whoopee cushions. Actually, I don't mind advertisements in magazines, but online ads drive me to the edge of the earth to vomit.<br/>4. Yes (if/when I become a publisher), and $30 seems reasonable assuming a decent audience.<br/>5. Sure, if I had anything to write worth reading.<br/>6. Original content is a must. If people are just submitting re-edited blog posts, I wouldn't subscribe. Original mini-games would be cool...kind of like what Dragon Magazine did years and years ago (Crime Fighters anyone?), but that might be hard to pull off.                        </div>

                            I've read all the Daedalus issues available online, I've read Push, I've read way the hell too much Pyramid.<br/><br/>I don't know about paying for a print version if the articles are available online.  One thing that I'd seriously consider is if the print version was ad-less and the online version had ads (or do three: web-with-ads (free), print-with-ads (at cost), print-without-ads (cost+margin)).  It also depends on content: if something would be really damn handy to have in print-and-bound form at the gaming table (like, say, the Names Project), then I'd totally buy.  If it's all abstract theoretical stuff, I don't have any reason to have it in physical format.<br/><br/>Advertisements are okay.  Especially in this community, ads are actually useful to me more often than they're a nuisance.  New games to look at!  But, and I think Brent touched on this, animated online ads?  Right out.<br/><br/>I would totally buy a $30 ad in Daedalus or Son of Daedalus, Matt.<br/><br/>I think the design community needs an outlet for not-quite-whole-book articles and games.  I've got a few of them that can't really stand on their own, but I think are valuable nonetheless.                        </div>

<b>1. Have you read at least 1 article of Daedalus or a similar 'zine? More than 1?</b><br/>I've read Daedalus and, of course, all of <a href="denied:htt://ptgptb.org" rel="nofollow">Places to Go, People to Be</a> which is very much focused on making play better (and we do even have a new issue pretty much ready to go).<br/><br/><b>2. Would you pay for a softcover "annual" (1-3 issues per year) of articles, even if they were freely available online? If not, what would you expect in a print volume to be worth paying for? Would you SUBSCRIBE to such an issue?</b><br/>I'm not sure I'd buy what was freely available. I have done so with games but I'm less interested in owning print versions of articles. I've wondered about a best of ptgptb but given that I don't think I'd buy it, I'mnot sure it's wort persuing.<br/><br/><b>3. What do you think of advertisements? On the web? In print?</b><br/>We don't have any adverts on ptgptb so it costs us money to publish it but I'm not against such things. It's our policy and we're sticking to it. But Yog-sothoth.com seems to do quite well using a donation model.<br/><br/><b>4. If you are a publisher, would you purchase ads on a website and/or print publication? Assuming a reasonable level of audience, would you be willing to pay up to $30 per ad per issue?</b><br/>We might. We've given donations to support other roleplaying ventures such as a con in Brisbane and the Indie roleplaying awards but we haven't paid for ads anywhere yet.<br/><br/><b>5. Would you be willing to write articles and assign rights to such a publication for a small fee ($15)?</b><br/>Possibly. But we don't pay so the creation of a market is possibly not in our interests.<br/><br/><b>6. Can you provide any other ideas or feedback?</b><br/>I liked Interactive Fantasy because it was more literary but it proved not to have much of a market. Robin's Laws of Gamemastering sold quite well, but then Robin is well known. I'm not sure how Aaron Rosenberg's Gamemastering Secrets did. Most of these things are focused on the GM side of things. We've tried in PTGPTB to cover the player side too but it has been rather neglected I think. And something that explained to people how to play the new kinds of games would be a great help to many people, and perhaps widen the audience. On the other hand, the market is mainly d20, would your zine be aimed at them?                        </div>

I've been aware of it, but just haven't ever "gotten around to it".<br/><br/>I have read a few articles in Push, which... well: is it similar?

Assuming a reasonable level of audience, would you be willing to pay up to $30 per ad per issue?<br/><br/>Yes; yes (my impression is that Daedalus is heard-of enough and well-thought-of enough that $30 is a good deal, though I can't point to something specific as the cause of that impression)<br/><br/>* Would you be willing to write articles and assign rights to such a publication for a small fee ($15)?<br/><br/>I might be willing to do so with some of my one-off game designs.  I also recall that Lacuna got its start in Daedalus, no?  And Jared is selling it standalone and expanded now.  Which says to me that I wouldn't be too fretful about whether or not we could come to an arrangement if I wanted to take a design/article notion and go a fuller publication route with it after it showed up in Daedalus.<br/><br/>* Can you provide any other ideas or feedback?<br/><br/>I'm racing past thee at the moment, so my brain isn't digging deeper just yet.

Do what you must. If they advertise something of interest to me, I generally read them. I used to read all the ads in Dragon, for example.<br/>I'd advertise if I had a product to sell, for sure. It's a niche market and I think Daedalus reaches my market pretty well. $30 seems reasonable for a decent-sized ad.<br/>I'd write articles for a small fee, sure.                        </div>

                            Have you read at least 1 article of Daedalus or a similar 'zine? More than 1?<br/>
<br/>
-Yes. Daedalus was one of my faves, as it happens. I read Inter*Action and Push too in the print realm, and various online things.<br/>
<br/>
Would you pay for a softcover "annual" (1-3 issues per year) of articles, even if they were freely available online? If not, what would you expect in a print volume to be worth paying for? Would you SUBSCRIBE to such an issue?<br/>
<br/>
-I'd expect some of the print stuff not to be available online, I think. I'd certainly subscribe to a decent print publication focused on AP and technique.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think of advertisements? On the web? In print?<br/>
<br/>
If you are a publisher, would you purchase ads on a website and/or print publication? Assuming a reasonable level of audience, would you be willing to pay up to $30 per ad per issue?<br/>
<br/>
-I think context is all. Relevant ads are good. Stuff that follows on directly from content. On a pure numbers game, I suppose I'd have to sell fairly minimal number of copies of Covenant to make a $30 ad worthwhile. But as a reader, I'm more likely to investigate an authors other works than the advert beside an article.<br/>
<br/>
Would you be willing to write articles and assign rights to such a publication for a small fee ($15)?<br/>
Can you provide any other ideas or feedback?<br/>
<br/>
-Write yes. Assign, depends on what content it is.                        </div>

Probably not if it were free. Again, content would be important to this.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What do you think of advertisements? On the web? In print?</b><br/>
No problem with ads, I understand the need for them sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<b>If you are a publisher, would you purchase ads on a website and/or print publication? Assuming a reasonable level of audience, would you be willing to pay up to $30 per ad per issue?</b><br/>
Sure. Assuming a reasonable size audience, $30 sounds reasonable, but it really would depend on the audience size.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Would you be willing to write articles and assign rights to such a publication for a small fee ($15)?</b><br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Can you provide any other ideas or feedback?</b><br/>
<i>Personally</i>, I would want to see magazine level pricing, or maybe even $10 an issue. The one turnoff I have about <i>Push</i> is the $20 price tag. It seems high for a non-game (though I do realize that it's not actually that high for a once a year journal). But that's me personally.                        </div>

                            Obviously, I'm a little biased here, being involved in a similar project but...<br><br>I read Daedalus and Push (obviously) and the Nordic con books and lots of other things.<br><br>I would pay for print, assuming it was awesome. And I know you're not going to do something that isn't awesome.<br><br>I don't think I'd subscribe, given how hard it is to put stuff out on time (believe me, I know).  I think the subscription model could be dangerous too, for the same reason.  Don't take people's money before you have a product to sell them.<br><br>Advertisements would be sweet of they were the "Forge defualt," 1-page ads in the back of the book talking about cool games by awesome people. Push would definitely buy an ad.  We might buy one on a website too, but I would prefer friendly and prominent link swappage, considering that we are sister publications, in effect.<br><br>I kinda prefer the Push model (surprise!) of letting authors keep full rights to the material but selling print rights to the editor (me, in this case).  Not that you'd sue people for reusing or developing their work later on, but just because, y'know?  Still, I wouldn't necessarily object to selling my work for $15.  I'd just have to be careful what work I submitted.<br><br>If you want another periodical person to knock heads with sometime, let me know.  I'd love to share some brain-picking.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Have you read at least 1 article of Daedalus or a similar 'zine? More than 1?<br><br/>I, unfortunately haven't.

(It was a government subsidized group/program, so that didn't mean skyrocketed prices.)<br/><br/>But... like I said - if these are ads for games, in a gaming magazine, I don't so much mind.

"3 New Dogs Towns!" "New click and lock templates for Capes!"<br/>In regards to the above suggestion... include stuff like this, but don't let it DOMINATE the publication. Stress cool design stuff, and cool theory stuff, and interesting articles.<br/><br/>Don't weigh it down with GNS theory and a super academic approach... unless you want a really limited audience.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>Have you read at least 1 article of Daedalus or a similar 'zine? More than 1?</blockquote>
Yep. I read almost all of all three issues of Daedalus. Terriffic stuff for the most part.
<blockquote>Would you pay for a softcover "annual" (1-3 issues per year) of articles, even if they were freely available online? If not, what would you expect in a print volume to be worth paying for? Would you SUBSCRIBE to such an issue?</blockquote>
If all content were freely available online, I probably would not buy a softcover version.<br/><br/>A print volume would need to have "more stuff" that I can't get for free and print at work.<br/><br/>I would Subscribe to such a magazine, if it were Generic and Cool enough.
<blockquote>What do you think of advertisements? On the web? In print?</blockquote>
I ENJOY ADVERTISEMENTS for material that is directed at me. I don't want to see male enhancement pills or weight loss drug ads, but if you have ads for other games, I will eat them up.
<blockquote>If you are a publisher, would you purchase ads on a website and/or print publication? Assuming a reasonable level of audience, would you be willing to pay up to $30 per ad per issue?</blockquote>
I will be releasing Tenra Bansho next year; with that in mind, I'd totally purchase ads in the print publication. For web? Not really. I'd want to pay less, probably, because of the fleeting effects of banner ads.
<blockquote>Would you be willing to write articles and assign rights to such a publication for a small fee ($15)?</blockquote>
I don't have the time. But, I'm not sure what this means: Contributors have to pay to have their articles posted?
<blockquote>Can you provide any other ideas or feedback?</blockquote>
I love Daedalus. You make more now soon please.                        </div>

                            * Have you read at least 1 article of Daedalus or a similar 'zine? More than 1?<br/>
<br/>
I read a few Daedalus articles, but not as many as I'd thought. I've previously read sh*tloads of 'zines - I was an A&amp;E subscriber/contributor for a while, edited my own Norwegian 'zine Imagonem, etc.<br/>
<br/>
* Would you pay for a softcover "annual" (1-3 issues per year) of articles, even if they were freely available online? If not, what would you expect in a print volume to be worth paying for? Would you SUBSCRIBE to such an issue?<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely pay to get a print edition in my mailbox, IF the 'zine was interesting enough to read in the first place. (That sounds very negative - but right now, there's really so much stuff I want to read that standards are way up).<br/>
<br/>
* What do you think of advertisements? On the web? In print?<br/>
<br/>
Whatever. I don't mind them at all, and if they're for something I might be interested in (an indie game I haven't heard of), I might even like them. IMO, ads lend a certain zeitgeist flavor to a 'zine, and it's fun to read them again some years later.<br/>
<br/>
* If you are a publisher, would you purchase ads on a website and/or print publication? Assuming a reasonable level of audience, would you be willing to pay up to $30 per ad per issue?<br/>
<br/>
I'm only half-way a publisher, and I wouldn't purchase ads anywhere at this point.<br/>
<br/>
* Would you be willing to write articles and assign rights to such a publication for a small fee ($15)?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, if inspiration strikes.<br/>
<br/>
* Can you provide any other ideas or feedback?<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to have a good teaser article with something (at least seemingly) provocative; and one or two small appetizers to start &amp; end the zine with, so you don't have to start reading a heavy 20-pager right away. Small bits are good.                        </div>

Web ads can be really annoying at times (popups, expanding images and whatnot) because they interfere with the content I'm trying to view.  Presumably, ads in this 'zine would be for cool stuff like indie-rpgs and such, so forth, so I'd be fairly favorably inclined towards them (What's this?

                            I've looked at Daedalus, but only to find the very first version of the Lacuna rules.  I skimmed the table of contents.  Nothing else caught my eye.  For all the noise about Push, there really hasn't been anything that made me want to find out more about it.<br/><br/>I don't have good impressions of 'zines -- it's probably the same impression that some people have of indie games.  I tend to think of them as a collection of poorly-written articles that don't really seem to go together, laid out in a font that is difficult to read, with either minimal thought to design or crammed with everything a meth-using second year graphic design major could think of.  Then they're xeroxed at the local Kinkos in runs of fifty, stapled together haphazardly, and left at a local used book store/comic book store/head shop on the counter to gather dust until the guy running the cash register finally decides to bin them.  <br/><br/>Now if you said you were going to put out a "magazine" instead of a "'zine" (heck, even a "quarterly magazine"), the perception changes drastically.  The word "'zine" has connotations.  Amateur.  Obsessed overenthusastic fans.  That strange mimeograph scent.<br/><br/>I don't mind web ads.  I have Firefox with AdBlock+ and FlashBlock, so I don't see ads online.  Ads in print, I don't mind either.  I'll skip over them unless one catches my eye.                        </div>

<b>Have you read at least 1 article of Daedalus or a similar 'zine? More than 1?</b><br/><br/>Yes. I read almost all of Daedalus.

That was my one complaint about Daedalus. My eyes hurt despite the skillful layout job. I'd also buy a subscription so long as I knew you were in charge of the project, Matt. Seriously, something like this put out by someone I didn't know? -- I'd worry about the whole thing going belly up.<br/><br/><b>What do you think of advertisements? On the web?

Assuming a reasonable level of audience, would you be willing to pay up to $30 per ad per issue?</b><br/><br/>Print, yes. Web, ummm, maybe. I'd also want to see a bit of the magazine, at least the initial issue, before committing.<br/><br/><b>Would you be willing to write articles and assign rights to such a publication for a small fee ($15)?</b><br/><br/>Write articles, yes. Assign the rights for $15, yikes. Probably not. I might do it for free, though, if I got to keep the rights. Alternatively, I may be willing to assign <i>some</i> of the rights for a small fee.                        </div>
