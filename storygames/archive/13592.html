It is essentially <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel" rel="nofollow"><b>Guns, Germs, and Steel</b></a> meets <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Rice_and_Salt" rel="nofollow"><b>The Years of Rice and Salt</b></a>: The Role-Playing Game</i>, with a dash of Roger Zelazny's <a href="http://www.uchronia.net/bib.cgi/label.html?id=zelagameof" rel="nofollow">Game of Blood and Dust</a><br/><br/>The meta-game involves the accumulation of four types of civilizational currency (Warfare [i.e., offensive technology--think guns], Life [i.e., population and biodiversity--think germs], Wealth [i.e., luxuries and ostentation--think "cargo," in the WWII cargo cult sense], and Knowledge [in particular, technical and scientific knowledge--think steel]). Those currencies pay for scenes that produce fictional outcomes, which then feed back into the meta-game. So each session is like a chapter in a book of never-was history.<br/><br/>But to prompt the historical imaginations of the players, I want to begin the game with a little alternate history mini-game that will tie alternate history breakpoints or "points of departure" (PODs) to playing cards. Each player (who in the meta-game will represent one or more "zones" or "civilizational centers"--basically continents) will have a small hand of cards (probably 3 to 5) to play a trick-taking game that changes the initial distribution of civilizational currencies in line with the imaginable consequences of the POD associated with that card.<br/><br/>So, for example, I'm playing the mini-game, representing North America, and I've got the Queen of Hearts, which I know means that <i>a comet misses the Earth in 10,900 BC, so there's no Younger Dryas ice age, so mammoths survive in North America</i>, giving North America +1 Warfare (because they have <i>war mammoths</i>) and +1 Life (because domesticated mammoths are a biological resource and a source of pathogens). I lead with that card, and that event happens. If someone throws a card with a <i>lower</i> value, its historically more recent event <i>doesn't</i> happen (probably because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect" rel="nofollow">butterfly effect</a>), but if someone throws a card with a higher value, its historically earlier event <i>does</i> happen. So, for example, if the player to my left goes with the King of Diamonds (<i>Atlantis really existed but sank in pre-historic times, so Atlantean refugees bring their super-science with them</i>, giving +2 Knowledge to the zone of her choice), then she's winning the trick and will lead next, assuming no one plays an ace. But if she plays the Five of Clubs, then she's thrown away the opportunity to have Mohammed killed while fleeing Mecca. After three to five tricks, you've got (a) the starting date for the game, based on the lowest card that anyone led, (b) a world-historical sketch with hopefully evocative fictional elements: Vikings in America! Native American war mammoths! Chinese treasure fleets in the Atlantic Ocean! and (c) a starting distribution for the meta-game "civilizational currencies." I think it's fun and elegant in a Rube Goldbergian way.<br/><br/>So what I need are more points of departure! Give me your favorite alternate historical breakpoints and their imagined consequences! I think I want to stick to stuff that's prior to 1500, though, so no alternate Civil Wars or World War IIs or any of that Turtledove stuff.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307092/#Comment_307092" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T09:21:27+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  9:21AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about Indigenous North and South American peoples repelling European invaders?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307094/#Comment_307094" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T09:46:51+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  9:46AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><b>Columbus Gives Up</b> - Maybe it was before Isabella relented and gave up the jewels; maybe it was somewhere in the Atlantic, facing a mutiny... but Columbus gives up and returns to Spain before finding the New World.</i><br/><br/>I don't grok your system well enough, but I'd expect the consequences to be reduced Spanish power due to lack of gold ans silver finds; increased Native American power because they're populations aren't destroyed by disease; and maybe increased tech for Spain, because they can spend resources on the continuing Renaissance rather than empire building?<br/><br/>Also, I wonder how well the  "generic" sense I get from the situation builder will work with specific shifts in history (like Bret and mine)?

One of the most important historical figures nobody knows about because he died in battle right before he achieved his potential.  As leader of Thebes he broke the back of Spartan dominance and established Thebes as the most powerful state in Greece, having in his possession as hostage the younger brother of the king of the minor backward kingdom of Macedonia...a lad by the name of Philip II.  When Epaminondas was killed along with both of his possible heirs (in a battle the Thebes actually won resoundingly), the resulting power vacuum (Athens crushed by Sparta, Sparta crushed by Thebes, Thebes crushed by fate) opened the door for Macedonia.  If he hadn't...would there ever have been an Alexander the Great?<br/>\n<br/>\nSticking with Alex because he was such a game changer...what if his army didn't mutiny in India and was just as eager as he was to keep on going...would he have made it to China, Korea, Japan?  If he hadn't died unexpectedly, what would the Hellene / Persian empire have looked like with a Persianophile like Alex in charge rather than the Persianophobe Seleucid.<br/>\n<br/>\nCyrus the Great not dying fighting the Massengetae is another fun one.  That guy was unstoppable, if he hadn't been killed on an unnecessary adventure in pursuit of an unobtainable woman...what would he have conquered next?

I'm going to use this as "Christopher Columbus caught in a storm at sea; all hands are lost" which leads to "European exploration across Atlantic slowed by lack of patronage." \n<blockquote>I don't grok your system well enough, but I'd expect the consequences to be reduced Spanish power due to lack of gold ans silver finds; increased Native American power because they're populations aren't destroyed by disease; and maybe increased tech for Spain, because they can spend resources on the continuing Renaissance rather than empire building?</blockquote>\nI'm going to call it "Europe: -1 Wealth, -1 Knowledge," because it seems to me that rather being a zero-sum allocation of resources thing, continued Renaissance-like knowledge production in the 16th century relied on the expansion of the European world-view enabled by the "discovery of the New World." The general failure of Europe's easterly project to establish trade routes with the Indies would probably have been a blow to the secular humanism of the Renaissance.\n<blockquote>Also, I wonder how well the  "generic" sense I get from the situation builder will work with specific shifts in history (like Bret and mine)? Do you actually need geological or "nation-agnostic" examples, so that they apply either globally or in a generic sense to a particular "zone" (respectively)?</blockquote>\nSpecific events are cool, so long as they can be parlayed into more general effects broadly applicable to approximately continental zones: Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, North and South America. The benefit of specific historical images, I think, is that they can then be reincorporated in play. In other words, if we establish that Constantine converts to a muscular Mithraism rather than Christianity, and that leads to less European anti-Semitism in the Middle Ages because of the inapplicability of the "blood libel" in that context, then regardless of what macro-level meta-game effects we anticipate (Europe: +1 Knowledge, perhaps, as Jewish intellectual traditions contribute more effectively to, e.g., Henry the Navigator's map-making project) we also know that we can have a Sephardic ship-captain and a Mithraist first mate sailing under the English flag to commit piracy on the Spanish Main.
