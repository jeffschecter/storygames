This is the first year I headed straight for the Forge booth and jumped in as many demos as I could. It's an absolutely brilliant concept and was definitely my favorite part of the Con. <br/><br/>These are the games I got to try:<br/><br/><b>Burning Wheel </b>- I heard a LOT about this game through Judd on SoK and was really excited to learn the system a bit. I stopped by the Burning Wheel booth and brought some friends to jump in the demo, but all we had time for was a test run combat. The system is very cool, scripting is incredibly fun and smooth, and just looking at a filled out character sheet provided a more concrete sense of the game. I had no idea Burning Wheel had so much crunch!<br/><br/><b>Dirty Secrets </b>- It's always fun to play games with the actual creators and Seth's love for detective fiction was obvious. His idea to create a GenCon specific crime for the demo was really fun idea and actually forced me to haul a friend across the Exhibit Hall to prove that Hero (5th Edition) really could inflict massive blunt trauma. I liked the narrative flow of the game, but detective stories really aren't my thing. Anyone that loves mysteries should definitely check the game out though!<br/><br/><b>Don't Rest Your Head </b>- Fred, you're the man. SotC rocks and I was really excited to jump in a DRYH demo when I saw you at the table. I already owned the PDF, but I was eager to have a "pro" demonstrate some of the stranger dice mechanics for me. The story with Officer Tock was creepy fun and the celeberity pre-gens were the best in any demo I played!<br/><br/><b>Dust Devils </b>- Not exactly a booth demo, but the session with Clyde at Games on Demand was still my first introduction to Dust Devils. My friend and I both had a blast and Clyde handled (what I gathered to be) a deceptively layered system that he had never actually sat in the "GM" seat for. I enjoyed the Devil mechanic immensely and Dust Devils will probably be my first after GenCon purchase.<br/><br/><b>Primitive</b> - Thanks go to Clyde again. My friend and I showed up too early for Games on Demand so Clyde ushered us to a table and gave us a crash course in Primitive. I heard a bit of buzz about the game previously and it was nice to get a proper introduction. Thanks for aiming to please Clyde!<br/><br/><b>Sorcerer</b> - Ron, what can I say? You're a fucking nutball, but you've got a solid game on your hands. Sorcerer was on my list of "eventual" purchases, but your demo pushed me into buying the book right then. (The fact that Dictionary of Mu was on my "eventual" lists as well didn't hurt either. I snagged a copy of it too!) Ron's energy was infectious and I hope I get a chance to play a proper session with him sometime. I can only imagine it would be an... experience.<br/><br/><b>Under the Bed</b> - Josh ran a neat story for me and a friend. UtB was an interesting inverse of Little Fears with a very cool character creation system. The game was really cool, but ultimately it was too "bright" for us. We really like the tragic side of Little Fears and UtB seemed to focus more on hope. It was a good game, just not so much for us. I also think Josh bit himself in the ass by speaking so highly of Mountain Witch, reminding me why I love it so much, and assuring me that Cold City was "all that and more". He sold me on Cold City!<br/><br/>Games I didn't get to try:<br/><br/><b>Dictionary of Mu </b>- Mentions of the Mu abound on Judd's podcast, I was really hoping to see it play out a bit.<br/><b>Contenders</b> - One of the only games left after GenCon that I need to learn a little more about before making a purchase decision.<br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard </b>- I bought the book on Friday, but I've never played it. I know a lot about it, but it would be nice to get a proper introduction from someone that's played it quite a bit.<br/><b>Psi Run</b> - Definitely the most unique idea I saw at the Ashcan Front. The dice decisions should be a ton of fun, but a demo would have convinced me to pick it up.<br/><br/>Thanks again to all you Story Gamers! GenCon 2007 was the best yet!<br/>-Jarvis                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88845/#Comment_88845" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T03:03:10+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  3:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you got value for money out of the demo teams!

I mean, not to fawn on me, but those words in their most basic and literal meaning, nothing extra or implied, no status involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? Because the demo model for the booth is my doing. The notion came to me after I'd attended my first two gaming cons (Origins and GenCon, 2000). I saw all these CCGs and boardgame booths with tables and demonstrators, walking people through one or two rounds of the game, and when someone said, "I get it! Cool!", selling them the game. I also saw all these RPG booths sitting around in sad, painful-to-see nowhere pockets, with piles of the books and desperate-looking exhibitors. The only exceptions were those which stunned visitors with glitz and booth-babes, or those which exploited sunk-cost brand-identity captive audiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nH'mmm, I said. I know how I'll do my Sorcerer booth in 2001. It needs to be a big celebratory party with full social continuity between exhibitors and customers. I did that. Then I thought some more and idea-jammed with some people, and in 2002, the first Forge Booth happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's OK to call me a fucking nutball, and I liked demoing with you too! I'm posting mainly to let you know where the goodness began. It's definitely true that it <i>worked </i>and it <i>continues </i>not because of me, but because of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89306/#Comment_89306" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T19:29:33+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  7:29PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have assumed the thanks was implied when the whole thread was started.

Not for the demos themselves or this particular instance. This was a non-humorous response to you saying, "what can I say?" I appreciate what you've posted and am OK with it, so please don't consider me to be demanding any kind of specific response from here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't reproduce my original post exactly, as I don't remember it exactly, but it was something like "maybe you should consider that [my efforts on behalf of the booth's existence] before you call me a fucking nutball." Then I spent the next few hours trying to justify myself in my head, running through dialogues to possible responses, which is a sure sign that I hadn't written something honest in the first place. So I came back and tapped into what I really needed to say and got rid of the flaky ego-protecting crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a minor addition to the thread content, Christopher Kubasik mentioned to me that his booth experiences from the early 1990s were demo-heavy, and that he was surprised to learn from this thread that they were apparently absent by 2000. Neither of us know whether the two sets of demos, in time, were basically the same, hence leading us to wonder what happened in the interim, or different enough from one another to be ignored for that purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I think maybe my Little Fears background made me miss that 'child abuse' part since I was assuming all the "monsters" were "real". I completely forgot the the child was abused and the toys were simply his way of 'dealing' with all of it. That is kind of messed up.

Until 2 months ago, the only indie game I ever heard of was Dogs and I assumed it was some weird 'artsy' roleplaying game about actual canines. Since Sons of Kryos, a new world of indie games opened for me and I've been catching up as fast as possible. I knew you were connected to GNS and FORGE, but the only thing I was <b>sure</b> you originated was Sorcerer and Kickers/Bangs.<br><br>Everyone that contributed to the awesome I got from the FORGE booth this year deserves tons of thanks.
