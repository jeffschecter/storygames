                    Hello all.  <br/>
<br/>
So silly question... <br/>
<br/>
I've been gaming for years.  But have GM'd enough times I can count them using both hands.  <br/>
<br/>
I recently ran a game of My Life With Master and I totally fell flat (in my opinion anyway) as a GM.  After talking with some friends, they helped me realize it's because I didn't 'own' the NPC's I was playing.  <br/>
<br/>
But how and why is it that I can 'own' my own PC's so well (At least people tell me that I can rock a character and I'd like to think I can) but why can't I rock an NPC?  Is it stage fright?  Is it that I'm jumping too high on the GM food chain?  Starting with a game like My Life With Master?  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas or advice?                </div>

<p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>One thing that struck me about that game, afterwards, was that not a single NPC outside of the Master had a name. (Given that many if not most of those NPCs were created by us players, that's really an area where <em>everybody</em> fell flat.) Not sure how huge of a deal that is, but it's definitely something that hit me pretty hard once it hit me, and might be a good place to start looking. Maybe something to do with investment, or something more esoteric that I'm not forge twunt enough to be familiar with. :-)</p>

                            Here's a rule of thumb I've adopted about NPCs.  I used to keep a lot of notes, be very detailed in my records and such, but I've stopped and started limiting it to what i can keep in my head for one simpel reason: If the NPCs are not interesting enough to _me_ that I can remember them, why in the world would my players bother to keep them straight?<br/>

                            Could you describe what felt wrong with the session in general?<br/><br/>One thing with MLwM is that it requires a certain GMin strategy. Basically, the GM has to be a jerk. He has to use the Master as a club and beat the players. He has to make the <strong>players</strong>---that's right, the players---HATE the Master and want him dead.<br/><br/>I bring this up because its possible your GMing wasn't that bad, but you just weren't in the right groove for the game.<br/><br/>Michael Miller wrote a manefesto on GMing MLwM a while ago... I can't remember where it is, but if you asked around the Half Meme forums I'm sure someone will give you the link.                        </div>

                            Maybe it's the 'invisible line' between playing and GMing that made you think you had to change? If you can narrate the hell out of a scene in a game like Roach, then you've basically done the same thing in some games that a GM would do (I unfortunately haven't played MLwM and can give no sustainable notions toward it). Grab those characters, Lisafy them, rock some group's world! Hopefully encouragement is just as good as advice.                        </div>

                            One thing I learned GMing is to give each NPC a distinctive name (try to make sure they don't sound alike) and a distinctive gimmick (certain way of dressing, certain way of speaking, certain way of acting, and so on).  This allows players to quickly pick up that the guy in the white gi is the local White Triad leader, but the guy with the booming monotone voice is the technomancer.  Because I'm playing so many characters, I find it easier to play "flat" characters instead of "round" characters, and there's a certain enjoyment to such characters as well.                        </div>

                            Heh. Sorry, I just started my literature classes.  I'm now just as bad about not defining my jargon.  [lambasts self]<br/><br/>The terms come from E.M. Forster's "Aspects of the Novel."  Off the top of my head, "round" characters are those that are three-dimensional (what we often associate with a well-developed PC or NPC) while "flat" characters are those that are two-dimensional (what we often associate with a convention PC or most NPCs).  In fact, a criticism of a Dickens character for sitting in a room all day wearing the same dress through the entire story immediately prompted me to think of how many NPCs do the exact same thing.<br/><br/>That being said, it's a situation with two ends.  If your NPCs are getting murky, it makes sense to "flatten" them and make them more distinctive and easier to classify.  If they're getting too bland, they should be "rounded" more to give them more life.                        </div>

New Crazy Ass Roleplaying Idea: A game where everyone must play a stock character -- the only choices the player has are picking the stereotype, picking the clothes, and picking the gear. Only through play can you "level up" and add detail and depth to your character, whichmust be related to the game's actions and events. Hell, don't even give the character a name until session 2.<br/><br/>So, Player A starts with Elfy-Elf in session 1, and by session 5 has Thurilbrond the Swift, an elven hunter known for his fleetness of foot.<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>

That's basically how <i>The Mountain Witch</i> works. You all start off as ronin, simply as that. You then develop your character's background in play, through the character's Fate.<br/><br/>But my next game, <i>In a Land Called...</i> is even more like that. You start by picking 3 things: A Personality-stereotype (Crochety Old Man, Loner, Tough Guy, etc.), a Skill Set (Soldier, Wizard, Thief, etc.), and a Tragedy (Amnesia, Dead Loved one, etc.). Then, in play, you create "Connections"---basically background stuff that connects your character to the world around you. You can check out the pre-alpha design draft <a href="http://www.timfire.com/IALC.html" rel="nofollow">at my website</a>.<br/><br/>Sorry for the thread-drift.

                            My suggestion is that you always take a moment to consider why you're bringing this NPC into the game environment. NPCs are either color, in which case they're no more important than any other piece of setting, or they exist to test, challenge, confound, provoke, etc. your PCs. If NPCs are the latter, no one will think they are flat if they pursue their agenda full-bore.<br/>
<br/>
In my current Burning Wheel campaign, I've got a nasty witch whose sole purpose is to push the norse runecaster/warlock PC. I'm using her to find out exactly how far the player will go in pursuit of his beliefs (I will give my eye for knowledge).<br/>
<br/>
I've got a devoutly Christian huscarl whose role is to keep pushing at the warchief PC, who has converted to Christianity for political reasons. He's going to keep picking at the warchief's belief: I fight for money, not faith.<br/>
<br/>
Consider who the players are and how they want their characters to be challenged. Then make your NPCs about that. The players will start caring about the NPCs awful quickly.                        </div>

                            This goes along with what Thor is talking about: When I GM Trollbabe, I make sure that all the important, named NPCs want something from the PCs.<br/>
<br/>
Another very general NPC-playing tip: have a list of names ready, so you don't have to come up with a name for an NPC on the fly.                        </div>

                            Wow guys!  Thanks for all the great advice.  I can understand what you mean too.  Challange the PC.  (duh)  I knew that.  *smacks forehead*  <br/>
<br/>
Tim:  Well what happened with the session (where I felt it went flat) is at one point, I realized all everyone was doing was just rolling for overtures and nothing else.  No one was even really narrating that either.  It had completely broken down into dice rolling.  And it had completely broken down into me railroading them and wow, that is not what I wanted at all!  I wanted them to make it their story (like we all do with other games like tMW, or the Roach, etc,etc.)  And the group were not novice indie gamers either.  They had just not played MLwM before (well except for Eric who's played once before) and I was a novice GM.  All of them can rock a game and I felt bad that I had let their night end on a down note with my suxxors game.  <br/>
<br/>
Jeph and Eddyfate:  You know, you have a really good point.  Names.  I never even thought about that.  Like Jon mentioned to have a list... you know, I've been in so many games where ther GM had a list.  I really don't know why that slipped my mind.                        </div>

                            What I usually do:<br/>
<br/>
Create a set of NPCs, focusing primarily on their motivations and why they're in conflict (and usually want something from the PCs).<br/>
<br/>
Once you have the motivations, you just play NPCs like you'd play a PCs- what would this character want to do?  Figure out which NPCs are going to have the most interesting actions/reactions and frame scenes around that.                        </div>

                            Lisa, I have exactly the opposite problem.  I've been a GM for as long as I can remember and it's become painfully obvious to me, during the last few games I've played, that I'm a really lousy player.  My instincts are just all wrong.

The Shadow of Yesterday has some really neat GMing advice.  It basically says to look at the player's character sheets and see what they want and throw in plenty of that.  But also throw in some stuff that you think is cool too.  I liked that.                        </div>

                            Hey, Lisa,<br/><br/>To be specific about <em>My Life with Master</em> for a moment, there's a good way to have the NPC's named <em>and</em> relevant: use the players' connections. If you're not sending them off to capture each others' favourite people, they're surely going to want to have overture after overture. Put the connections in danger, and the villainy and violence flows, in my experience. I ran it recently, and didn't need to institute a '<em>no consecutive overtures</em>' rule: the players trapped themselves in the Master's commands.<br/><br/>Also, again specifically for MLwM, the NPC you <em>really</em> need to own is the Master, who is by definition named, invested and present. <br/><br/>Finally, I would say that, yes, MLwM is a hard one to get down as a first-time GM, though. The rules are only apparently simple: sticking to them is very necessary, and rather hard when you're also managing a campaign of brutal psychological warfare.<br/><br/>- Alexander                        </div>

                            This is a silly question, yes. <br/>
<br/>
Rather, I recall a moment in the otherwise unmemorable movie "Young Sherlock Holmes" in which Watson and some other character approach Holmes trying to play a violin. He plays a few sour notes and throws the instrument down in disgust saying something like, "Damn thing, I've been working at this for two days now, and I still haven't mastered it!"<br/>
<br/>
Two hands worth of games? I don't want to scare you, but I only feel that I became a solid GM after about two decades of it, amounting to, I dunno hundreds of games I'd run? How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice. <br/>
<br/>
There's no magic bullet. <br/>
<br/>
Now, that said, two important points:<br/>
1. In RPGs, OK is good enough. That is, OK, one session of one game, and you didn't have fun. Have you had fun other times in other games? You are probably at the very least "adequate" as a GM, and that's good enough to run. It's a percentages game, and we all have bad nights. Let me tell you about a couple of weeks back...<br/>
2. You're going to learn faster than most. Why? Because you're conscientiously working on it, and doing so in what may be the most advanced forum for discussing the how to of these things in the world. It only took me two decades because we hadn't even invented the language to discuss the salient issues, or otherwise figured out how to talk about it, other than articles by people pulling stuff out of their asses and published in Dragon Magazine. Cripes. <br/>
<br/>
So, just a bit of encouragement. Keep running games, and, likely very soon, your percentages will be past adequate to "high enough that I don't worry about it any more." <br/>

You make a good point.  A very good point.  (It's funny you should mention Young Sherlock Holmes... twas just on the other day).  I just thought it would be 'easier' for me to grasp it 'quicker' since I've been gaming for longer than I could tie my shoes easily.  (No crap.  Mom introduced me to D&amp;D at age 4!)  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for that simple reminder Mike!<br/>
<br/>
And to everyone else, thanks for all the advice.  <br/>

                            Just wanted to pop in. Realized I never said that I had a good time in the game. Maybe it wasn't as dismal and dark as it's "supposed" to be, but you gave me enough skeleton to hang some fun on, and in these new style games I'm responsible for my own good time, which I had.                        </div>
