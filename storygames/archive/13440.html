The game system is unique to this game. In a Wicked Age you can play peasant or king, demon or god. Any character might decide the fate of the world. In this wicked age, your birth is not yours to choose, but your fate is what you make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis game has an implied sword and sorcery, with the details left to fill in as part of the in game play. Part of the fun of this game is for all the players to put in details of the game world, and share it with the group. The game has a heavy emphasis story and personal drama; you're creating a collaborative story together where everyone is partly the author, and no single player has control of the plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIAWA follows the traditional format of having one player take on the role of game master, or GM, and everyone else takes on the role of running a single player character, or PC. Some of the responsibilities of these two roles may not be familiar to many gamers, however. The GM does not write the story, and the players can easily choose to play different PCs from chapter to chapter.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne area that IAWA differs from most other RPGs is that this game is not structured on the idea that there will be a party of PCs working towards a common goal; instead it focuses on the different, often conflicting, goals each character has. There can be temporary and dangerous alliances between characters quite easily, but just as easily set PC against PC. IAWA is game where every character is out for their own good. The rules for the game handles the conflicts this sets up very well. The sword and sorcery setting is in a wicked age, not in a PCs play nice together age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game plays out in different sessions, or chapters. Each chapter has one of four themes, called an Oracle. Each Oracle has a different general theme, setting the tone of the game for that chapter. The default Oracles are: Blood &amp; Sex, God-kings of War, the Unquiet Past, and a Nest of Vipers. The Oracles are set up as a chart, with one game element matching a card in a standard card deck. After choosing the Oracle, you draw 4 random playing cards from your deck. These give your group four game elements to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few friends played a trial run of the game with me. For the first chapter of our story, we chose as Oracle: the Unquiet Past. Our random elements were:<br/>\n<br/>\n* A ruthless bully of an under-officer with high ambitions.<br/>\n* A girl with the soul of a leopard, born inappropriately into a human body.<br/>\n* A market on the crossroads, full of sound and color.<br/>\n* The secret central shrine of a temple to forbidden gods.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom here the group adds in further elements inspired by and connected to these four. We had the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n* The head priest of the shrine to forbidden gods, in search of the leopard souled girl.<br/>\n* A big and burly guard for hire, the long lost brother to the leopard souled girl, looking for work in the market.<br/>\n* Seer, bullied by the ruthless under-officer. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom this list, each player chooses one to be their character. The random selection from cards gives many possibilities, and the further elements that you can add in from these 4 random seeds are almost unlimited. It could be a wandering intelligence, a raving prophet, a slave, a great wizard, a king, a spirit, a demon, or a god. IAWA, any of these are potential characters. In our first chapter, one of the players could easily have added in and chosen one of the forbidden gods of that secret shrine to play, just as easily as choosing the leopard souled girl. All characters not chosen as players as their PCs become non-player characters, or NPCs, run by the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext you give stats to both PCs and NPCs. PC stats are built with scores called forms. They describe ways to perform actions such as Covertly, Directly, For myself, For others, With violence, and With love. These forms each get a dice score, from d4 to d12, with higher dice being better. NPCs get only three forms, action, maneuvering, and self-protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter forms comes strengths. Strengths are unusual skills, magical arts, innate powers, allies, or treasures that the characters have. It could be the power of exorcism, inhuman fortitude, powerful instincts of a leopard warrior spirit, a staff that changes into a viper to strike at enemies, or lightning that a god hurls down at her enemies. At the start of the game, each character has only one strength, but more may be added between chapters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter strengths come the best interests of the characters. These are what the player wants to be the focus of the story about their character. Each PC gets two interests, and each NPC gets one or two. It is done in a round robin way, so they can play off each other as they are put together. The best interests of each PC should at best go against the strengths of other characters, with PCs and NPCs treated equally. The best interests of NPCs should go against PCs where they are weak.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe forms, strengths and best interests are the only stats the characters have. There is no measure of how strong or smart they are. That is completely up to the players controlling these characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom here, the game is put into motion. The web of best interests of the various characters should lead to interesting struggles. PCs should go against PCs and NPCs where they are strong, while the GM should have the NPCs go against the PCs where they are weak. This structure leads to conflicts where the PCs tend to go onto what is called the owe list. The owe list allows the player to gain an advantage in dice rolls at a later time, and it is how a player can automatically carry over their character from chapter to chapter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile playing the game, the GM sets the scenes. This should be done with an eye towards driving the PCs towards opportunity for conflict, as the PCs try to accomplish their best interests as well as foil the best interests of characters that go against them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo dice are rolled until someone has their character take a concrete action that someone else would oppose. Someone sneaking up and planting a dagger between the shoulder blades of a PC would be opposed, for instance; unless the player really wanted their character to die. Another action that might be opposed might be trying to find a thief hidden in a crowded market square. Convincing a scared scholar to rebel against his tyrannical king, however, would not be a concrete action. It's just talk. The person playing the character decides if they oppose the actions or not. Regardless of the type of action (running, fighting, or magic), the dice mechanics are the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game rules limit all conflicts to 3 rounds of dice rolls, at most. The rolls are pretty quick and basic. The rhythm of the conflict can take a bit to get used to. Once you determine that a conflict is happening you roll dice. Only after dice are rolled do you determine the actions that are happening in that conflict. The highest die in the roll goes first, and then order goes from there down to lowest. The highest rolling character states an action, and the one they are acting against re-rolls their dice in response. The response determines who has the advantage in a conflict, or to what degree it is a success or not, depending on how well you roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict continues back and forth like this for only 3 rounds, at most, unless it is definitively ended sooner, by dice rolls or player agreement. At the 3rd round you have a definitive winner of the conflict. So the winning player gets what they want, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot quite. What the winner has is a stick to negotiate consequences with. At worse, all they can force is the loser to be exhausted or injured. Either of these cause the character to be less effective for the remainder of the chapter. Multiple injuries or exhaustion can cause the loss of the player for the remainder of the chapter, including possible death of the character. This can be a pretty big stick to negotiate with.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of injury or exhaustion, you can negotiate for other consequence. This could include having the characters being captured and tied up, being taken by slavers, being knocked unconscious and robbed, being humiliated in court and having allies turn away from them, or most anything else. There are a few restrictions on what you can negotiate for, but overall it is very open.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe outcomes of conflicts are something that is very different than most other RPGs. The only outcome of a conflict that happens is what is agreed to by both sides. A thief can't actually get away with the gold they pickpocket, even if they're the winner of a conflict. Not unless the player that lost the conflict agrees to it. The winner only has a strong stick in the negotiations to try and get that gold. There are a few other rules for negotiation, but it is strongly consensus oriented in how it affects the ongoing story.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a pickpocket won the conflict to try and steal a pouch of gold, then the players of the two characters go into negotiations. Basically, give me the gold or you're injured or exhausted. If the other player refuses to give the gold, then the pickpocket doesn't succeed in taking the pouch. In the game, this might play out that the thief was detected and ran through the market to evade capture. The character that lost the conflict gave chase across the rooftops of the city, but was completely exhausted by the run. They will now have less dice for any further conflicts. An injury instead of exhaustion would be handled similarly, but you could decide that they tripped and sprained their ankle while trying to chase down the pickpocket, or most anything else that involves injury.<br/>\n<br/>\nA chapter ends once most of the characters best interests are resolved, one way or another, or one character has emerged as a clear protagonists with their best interests resolved, or you plain run out of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of a chapter a new Oracle is chosen by the player with their character at the top of the owe list. Four new elements are introduced into the game, one by the same player on top of the owe list, and the rest by random cards. Only the character at the top of the owe list carries over by default. All other players must either buy their characters in from the owe list, or must tie in their character to the new elements chosen from the Oracle. Players may also wish to pick up new characters at the start of a chapter, instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also between chapters that character advancement happens, and recovery of dice from exhaustion or injury. New chapters can skip forward or backward in time, showing flashbacks or far reaching consequences decades down the line. New chapters can be moments later, with the same group of PCs and only new potential NPCs brought in, or can be an almost complete new set of characters, decades later, with only a single PC the same between the two chapters. It's very dynamic in potential.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall IAWA is fun, and makes an interesting, dramatic story as you play the game. It's fast paced, with fairly simple mechanics that should be easy to pick up. The structure of the game conflict might be a bit odd for some more traditional gamers. Dice rolls happen before the action, and winning a conflict does not mean the character gets what they want out of it, but the mechanics work very well together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game book itself is a thin black and white softcover, 36 pages in length. It has very nice line art suitable to the theme of the game. It's a small, inexpensive book, but has a lot of fun bound up in those pages. On the down side it could have used a few more illustrations, and I felt the examples given for game play could have been written a bit more clearly and extensively. Overall those are minor points. If you like sword and sorcery and collaborative storytelling, get this game and see if you can't create your own Wicked Age.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303186/#Comment_303186" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T05:50:19+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  5:50AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you david :) I've got this game and we've tried a few games with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat type of games did your group normally play? How did they find the change of rules?<br/>\nUp here in cold iceland, our group was mostly into the White Wolf/BRP school of gaming. 1gm in charge of making "the plot", and the other players along for the ride, enjoying adding in their character's bits and bobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn't make the cross over so well :(<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I loved it, but many of us couldn't get into the whole "negotiate outcomes". Do I get it or not? was a big problem for us, and the discussions turned more into arguments, or sulky silence. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game decended into using bigger die to knock out the other players - and the target felt helpless to stop it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur two tries were not very enjoyable for the group, and they went back to white wolf systems.<br/>\n<br/>\n. I loved it personally, and will be trying another consensus type game (fiasco) next week - although I'm trying to get some people who are not habitual rpg players to try it out. I'm hoping it wont get the same prejudiced trial.<br/>\n<br/>\nK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303252/#Comment_303252" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T17:21:17+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  5:21PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome to Story Games!<br/><br/>In a wicked age is my favorite game; I've played it a LOT.

Some are big into Shadowrun or White Wolf, others had only played D&amp;D, and some had never gamed before. The worst reaction I've gotten so far was that some players had fun, but games like that would only be an occasional thing for them... they'd mainly stick with other games. This was from the more Shadowrun/White Wolf focused player. If you try to play this game in the way that you describe with the GM in charge of the plot, it won't work. Some players don't enjoy having more story control, and others just don't realize it's possible or don't know how to do it. If it's the former type, there's not much you can do about it. If it's the latter, you may just need more practice and perhaps discussion about what type of game you're expecting. Something like the <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-same-page-tool/" rel="nofollow">Same Page Tool</a> might help with that.<br/><br/>As for the negotiating outcomes, that is one of the trickier parts of the system. It's more complex that I got into with my basic review. <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=26103.0" rel="nofollow">Breaking Bad Habits</a> discussion goes over some of that as well as a few other issues some people have.<br/><br/>It's possible that the negotiating outcome problems that your group had were a big part of why the other players didn't really get into it right off. If so, great! That's something that can be fixed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303288/#Comment_303288" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T07:47:39+00:00" title="December  5, 2010  7:47AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to play In a Wicked Age                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303305/#Comment_303305" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T11:15:06+00:00" title="December  5, 2010 11:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that Breaking Bad Habits link is cool.

Since a game is often over in two hours, you could play two or three of them in a sitting which would showcase some of the multi-chapter fun.

That's the best advice that I've come across for running IaWA one-shots; after you get character and situation creation down, every chapter runs for as close to an hour as you can manage it. Hit it hard. If you can burn through four chapters in a session, three at the very least, you get a good taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303446/#Comment_303446" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T12:42:46+00:00" title="December  6, 2010 12:42PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Vincent Baker said playing a couple sessions in a night is a good idea, though that kind of is the opposite of what he said about aggressive pacing being a bad habit...<br/><br/>Even without multiple sessions, it's still a good idea to not use your biggest dice, because:<br/>* you can use the owe list for an advantage later when you really want it<br/>* losing the "initiative" makes you the answerer which means you control narration (up until the other guy wins the sequence, anyway...) - and I didn't know this until yesterday, when I read the bad habits thread                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

They get people engaged and interested in the story at hand right away. Not a generic story or a genre, but the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">actual specific story</span> we're going to tell. That is important stuff.<br/><br/>You don't have to explain any rules, or bring out the funny dice, or talk about the forms, or any of that sometimes-intimidating gamer stuff. You tell the names of the Oracles (no description!), everyone agrees on one, and each player picks a card, reads the entry, and then passes the deck and the book. It works like a charm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304121/#Comment_304121" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T20:58:57+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  8:58PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2010 8:59PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...although you may need to look for a different set of Oracles if your group is anything like ours.

Once a player says something cool, be vocal in your support of it, get it written down.  Make it concrete, give it names, add detail even before play.  (i.e. Don't let Oracle pulls turn into setting-design-by-committee.)<br/><br/>2) Being right there to support players for the back-and-forth of conflict resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
