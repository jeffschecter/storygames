My goal for design was to offer as open a world as possible that would put the focus on exploration and discovery. Likewise, a persistent and evolving world gives players opportunity to shape how the world grows. With only a very simple overarching plot, anyone can GM and contribute their own ideas, and players can drop in and out as they please without needing to make a regular commitment. <br/><br/>I decided on Dungeon World for the ease of pick up and play and to allow characters of different levels to be able to run in the same group together and still contribute.<br/><br/>I\u2019d like to know what people\u2019s experiences have been in both playing and running living campaigns like this. What are some of the best standards and practices for group recruitment, efficient dissemination and compilation of information, and overall plot structure? What needs to be done to hold the players\u2019 interest and keep them coming back for more, especially for players who want to take on the GM hat for a while?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448438/#Comment_448438" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-10T09:48:26+00:00" title="September 10, 2015  9:48AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

Allow people to take over GMing, players to come and go, and people play a whole stable of characters. Your group will naturally figure out how to separate authority. (For instance, you don't need to worry about a player taking over an adventure you're running, because they don't know what's behind the adventure and they want to know themselves what secrets it hides. So they will very naturally start something in a different area of the campaign with minimal overlap, unless you agree to share responsibilities with them expicitly.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morrius" title="Morrius"><img alt="Morrius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morrius">Morrius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448487/#Comment_448487" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-12T01:38:41+00:00" title="September 12, 2015  1:38AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>1.

You're also somewhat at the mercy of finding an available GM in the near future. <br/><br/>Conversely, a proactive GM can advertise what they are interested in running, and bring in a group that way. It's been my experience that a lack of GMs is traditionally the limiting factor in getting groups together. But then, this isn't ideal either, since it may remove some player agency.<br/><br/>Maybe use a combination of both?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448499/#Comment_448499" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-12T18:56:01+00:00" title="September 12, 2015  6:56PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, definitely a mix.

Otherwise player agency is reduced - what is a sandbox where they can only accept the offered adventure and not go wherever they want?<br/><br/>Players having several characters could also help, in that they can send in less favoured ones when the GM is offering Death love doom.<br/><br/>The West marches method of players saying when they can get together and where their characters will adventure, and then GM attending (if possible), is much more player-driven.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
