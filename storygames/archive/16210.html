The specific reason for this is to define character histories and initial relationships before play, filling the same niche as DW bonds. These won't have mechanical weight, but should provide increased cohesion in an ensemble-cast style of game.  My plan was to present a two distinct lists of leading questions: one relating to other PC's and another relating to the factions/organizations defined in the setting. Players would be asked to choose at least one question from each list to answer for their character.<br/><br/>Here are my current lists of questions. I would love to have suggestions on new questions to add, tweaks to existing ones or ones that need to be removed outright. General discussion on what makes a good leading question would be great as well.  In my particular game, I don't have a pre-set situation so I have to keep them somewhat generic.<br/><br/><br/>How did another PC hurt you?<br/>Which other PC did you a favour?<br/>Why do you hate a specific PC?<br/>Why do you trust a specific PC with your life?<br/>Why are you afraid of a PC?<br/>Why do you disagree with a PC\u2019s belief?<br/>How did a specific PC inspire you to take up one of your beliefs?<br/><br/>Why do you hate a specific faction? <br/>Why do you trust a specific faction with your life?<br/>Why do you unfailingly obey a specific faction?<br/>Why have you vowed to destroy a specific faction?<br/>Why are you afraid of a specific faction?<br/>Why are you passionate about a specific faction\u2019s mandate?<br/>How did a specific faction inspire you to take up one of your beliefs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369893/#Comment_369893" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T23:07:53+00:00" title="March 28, 2012 11:07PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I think relationships are there to drive and complicate.  i.e. spur the character to do stuff and/or cause trouble for the character.<br/><br/>Looked at through that lens,   "Why do you trust a specific PC with your life?"  and "Why do you disagree with a PC\u2019s belief?" and "How did a specific PC inspire you to take up one of your beliefs?" are not as strong as the others.

Even if it's a nominal award, like a few XP or a minor bonus to some action, give people a solid reward to pursue any relationship as defined.<br/><br/>Here's some bonds:<br/>What did the other PC teach you that you still find valuable?<br/>What relative do you and the other PC share?<br/>What do you owe to the other PC and why is it so important to you to pay it back?<br/>Where do you and the other PC come from and how is it important to both of you?<br/>Who have you and the other PC both sworn to destroy?<br/><br/>You might want to give bigger rewards or extra points for more controversial relationships:<br/>What character do both you and the other PC love? Why do you love this character? (Let the other PC give their own reasons why.)<br/>What scarce or unique resource do both you and the other PC need? Why do you need it. (Let the other PC give their own reasons why.)<br/>What crime did you commit that the other PC suspects you of? <br/>(Note, with relationships like this, it's often better if the player who gets to name the relationship must also be the one who has the morally=questionable side of it. In general, do you like being forced to play someone unsavory? Unless it's part of the explicit (or implicit) contract of the game, you probably want to set up your own moral parameters.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381799/#Comment_381799" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T22:45:19+00:00" title="June 10, 2012 10:45PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Noofy</b>: The concern with "when" is that it is too focussed and doesn't give the richness of context that you get with a "why" in my experience.<br/><br/><b>Arpie</b>: Those bonds are excellent, thank you.<br/><br/>The underlying reason for these history questions is to establish a context for the characters, at the start of play.
