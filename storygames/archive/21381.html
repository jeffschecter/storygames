GMs should be able to use these tables to provide the players with simple/shallow information about why the people in the seat of power are there right now and what are they controlling.<br/><br/>So far I've got the idea that, leaving aside specific fronts, leaders and villains in the setting,  there are levels of economical, military and religious power - of different origin and theme, dictated by the setting used- that may rise, go into decadence, disband, or change focus. A change in the status of each power may be dictated or not by a change of leadership, presence or absence of information (either orchestrated by competitors or accidental), or a step forward or backward in terms of technology/magic.<br/><br/>Has anybody heard of anything similar that may save me the work of doing it?

Like, in the last session the PCs helped a group of poachers and got rid of a nest of giant spiders. I could roll for the local economy and use the roll to determine if the consequences are positive or negative in the long run. Then I could roll for the major factions and see if this event affects their plans as you stated above: progress towards goal, personal economic loss, etc.<br/><br/>Perhaps it can be as simple as that, a checklist of factors that could have been altered by players choices, to see how the setting will respond to them. I'm somewhat doing this now, when I prep for the next session based on consequences, but this procedure could bring up the butterfly effect up to 11. Then I could reuse my table of random emotional reactions to give me a guide of the possible reactions of each NPC. Perhaps the hardest part would be to keep each group properly updated based on how far their influence reaches and how far the repercussions of each particular event actually go.<br/><br/>Like, the economy of the poacher village could go down now that they discover that the spiders did more damage to the forest than they thought. A high roll on technology could mean that they found out how to harvest and reuse the spider's silk, so that's another chance for their economy to go back up again, or a new business scheme that could backfire on them. The kingdom of the elves on the far west could remain unaffected, unless they get interested in silk enough to send merchants.<br/><br/>Perhaps this could be something to brainstorm along with the players or with another group of people to keep the players in the dark. Anyway, the checklist of factors that comes up to my head so far includes:<br/><br/>-Information (definitely the first one, does news of this reach too far? how long do they take?)<br/>-Technology (does it mean any advance for the culture or technology of anyone or the opposite?)<br/>-Economy (who gets rich and who goes poor now because of this?)<br/>-Power balance (is the offensive or defensive military strength of any group affected?)<br/>-Faith (does it favour any god, is it seen as a good or bad omen by any group?)<br/>-Reaction (When the leader of a front gets the news, how do they feel? Why?)<br/><br/>I should probably limit the reach of this to two fronts just to keep things short. The first front reacts directly to the event, while the second reacts to the moves of the first one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468071/#Comment_468071" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-29T21:58:09+00:00" title="November 29, 2017  9:58PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> Yeah!

Reading the dice usually gives me more ideas than linking the results to specific lists or ratings. <br/><br/>For reactions of fronts and NPCs, using a random table of emotions works better for me. Like, the poachers are now thriving in the silk business, the king of the elves (or more possibly, most of the people on the elven kingdom) are quite happy now; that must mean they no longer have to depend on the Drow to get their silk and are interested on making business with the poachers. A couple natural consequences from that that would require no roll would be the Drow getting pissed off and the Poachers becoming a front by their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468076/#Comment_468076" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-29T22:53:36+00:00" title="November 29, 2017 10:53PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> !

The real prompt is the connection to another faction. So, when your Elves do something, it prompts you to say how it affects, say, the King. I would imagine the "how" would usually be obvious, but, if not, you could use a list of emotions.<br/><br/>Another idea would be to borrow something like Fiasco's Tilt tables, and seed it with elements which occur in the sort of fiction/world/story you want to see. Things like, "_____ sees an opportunity available to them which has never before seemed possible." You could experiment with how much you want this to be randomized versus chosen by taste or whim - in fact, a semi-random selection like Fiasco's tables could suit your game quite well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468089/#Comment_468089" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-30T17:55:51+00:00" title="November 30, 2017  5:55PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing I was just discussing with one of my players is that just creating random stuff, even based on consequences of player actions isn't actually optimal.<br/><br/>I mean, yes, the drow pissed with the elves and the Grand union of (ex-poachers) Silk Traders makes sense, looks interesting, it's an unexpected development of the events... but is it really in the players expectations? Wouldn't it just divert them from their goal to fight the Frost Orcs of the north? Does it has anything to do with the undead-cleansing abilities the cleric has been piling up for the past two levels, expecting to encounter them up ahead?<br/><br/>So basically, this doesn't change too much of the procedure, except that it dictates in which way the prep gets increased. Sure, these consequences still come to pass, but it won't mean that prep for drow encounters or new missions from the Guild are needed. All this will just became color, unless it directly affects the PCs. If said drows are in the path to the north, then at least one drow random encounter will appear on the lists. Or perhaps they will be now more interested in making a deal with the orcs or just leave them a safe path through their territory. All they would need to do is to go deeper anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468109/#Comment_468109" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-01T14:27:12+00:00" title="December  1, 2017  2:27PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> All this will just became color, unless it directly affects the PCs.

A war in the north against, let's see, poachers) or in the future (Who's involved in the war the GM has decided to trouble the north with? Two random groups, drow vs. poachers).<br/>Such questions are worth asking, even when idle curiosity is the only reason to ask, and worth answering, because they contribute to the forming story of the game. and provide continuity (for example, when the players decide to deal with the drow after months of game time the GM is ready to say that they mostly dispersed in the north after losing the war).<br/>Whether the random answers affect the adventure directly or remain in the background isn't very important; there are many other "seeds" to grow, and most will be ignored anyway.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468188/#Comment_468188" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-04T16:26:11+00:00" title="December  4, 2017  4:26PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Never meant to say anything about knowing in advance what will affect the party. that's totally opposed to my current gaming style. <br/><br/>What I was trying to say was that the players will give you signs of what were they really interested into when they started the campaign and what are they expecting now: it will be in their character sheets, you can further notice if you throw a couple of random clues at them and ask what they see there (like a rorschach test). So, if the cleric is piling up undead killing abilities and spells, you'll know he wants to fight undeads, not drows nor poachers. If the goal they stated at the start of the game says "wipe the orc menace from the north" delaying their trip with too many sidequests will feel like a waste of time, no matter how interesting were the things generated by the random engine, because they were expecting orcs from the start.<br/><br/>So, player expectations are one of the most important things you need to know from the start. The rest you can suggest to the players, just to give them choices to see if they spark their interest. Lots of those options are already in the book, in minimal details like the choice of class and species. If a player wants to be an elf it's because she has a mental image of what an elf is. But that image will rarely be the same mental image the DM has of elves, so best practice I found was to ask the player questions about the elves before even including them in the setting. If more than one player is playing an elf then a brainstorm is needed before the DM puts down on her prep that there are more than a couple of elves in this plane.<br/><br/>Tl,dr: random content creation is alright, as long as the lists are made of player expectations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468484/#Comment_468484" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-16T20:04:42+00:00" title="December 16, 2017  8:04PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted this in another thread the other day but it's on this topic really: I made this \u201crumours\u201d chart for a political struggle in my game, the election of a new pope.

Most of these were pre-existing but I also added some new ones, and allowed the chart to add or remove them. Each had a number of votes (starting with a 2d6 roll for their general influence level), and a bad thing happening would add or subtract maybe 1d4 or 1d6, moving votes from one to the other. The players used the carousing phase to try to persuade voters as well, and also interacted with the candidates directly during play (persuading them to step down, fighting them, etc).<br/><br/><a href="http://sstabhmontown.tumblr.com/post/167957391946/papal-rumours" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sstabhmontown.tumblr.com/post/167957391946/papal-rumours</a><br/><br/>During the last few weeks of the quest there was a delightful fear among the group that they might actually cause the world to end before finishing the adventure, as the results started to get into properly apocalyptic territory.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468491/#Comment_468491" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-16T23:32:02+00:00" title="December 16, 2017 11:32PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting! Also, <a href="/forums/profile/chance">@chance</a>.thirteen mentioned a mechanic in Underground, an rpg from the 90's. It goes more or less like this: Players state a short term goal towards changing their society in a specific way. If they complete their goal they get to level up and shift one parameter one point in the scale. The catch is that whenever they move one parameter, another two shift too, one up and the other down, unless they spent three times the cost in XP. It's better explained <a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/showthread.php?758-Underground-by-Mayfair-Games" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>The parameters themselves can be improved/adapted a bit, and I'm thinking definitively to assign to a faction/front the control of one or more parameters. There's still the issue of how to make it simpler (maybe just make things more visual?) So while single characters or small groups would definitely have goals more related to their own emotions and background, big groups of people would move mostly accordingly towards the flow of resources that most benefits them as a group.<br/><br/>I'm already preparing something, I'll post it here hopefully next week.

The cost will depend on the size of the area/amount of people affected*<br/>-Neighbourhood = 5 xp<br/>-Small Faction = 10 xp<br/>-City = 20 xp<br/>-Big faction = 30 xp<br/>-Reign/State = 40 xp<br/><br/>* Add enough zeroes to adjust for the XP budget you are used to give to your players by session and the speed at which you prefer changes to affect the setting. Be aware that players can either pool up their resources or oppose each other when you do the adjustment to the costs. Also, read below more about the range of the values for the parameters.<br/><br/>The society parameters are:<br/><br/><b>-Health:</b> from plagues and low survival rates of newborns to eradication of diseases and longevity <br/><b>-Technology:</b> From the most straightforward and low tech way of doing things to a totally automated one.<br/><b>-Wealth:</b> from famine and poverty to excess and opulence<br/><b>-Wealth distribution:</b> at low levels poor people doesn't even own themselves and rich ones own everything including justice. At high its way too suspicious how everything holds up in an utopia with no personal property where all needs are sated. Or maybe not.<br/><b>-Safety:</b> anarchy and mere survival at its lowest, iron grasp control at highest.<br/><b>-Information and education:</b> from obscurantism and superstition to free media and a refined culture.<br/><b>-Administration:</b> from a full corruption hellhole to efficient administration.<br/><br/>Whenever one parameter is moved up by the players, the previous one in the list goes up too and the next one in the list goes down by one point. Whenever one parameter is shifted down by the players, the previous one goes down by one point too. This could be avoided by paying the triple amount of XP to keep the other parameters from shifting.<br/><br/>The range for the values of the parameters should be low for short campaigns (1-6) and higher for longer ones (1-20)<br/><br/>Players should be encouraged to define their personal and group goals based on how they plan to affect society, so the GM can help them devise a simple plan of action that will effectively end up changing a specific parameter of the society.<br/><br/>Also, you could give each front/faction in your game goals based on keeping the status quo on one or two parameters, or shifting them for their benefit. For example, the guild of thieves may like to keep safety high enough to make profit and low enough to avoid the risks of getting caught by guards they don't have on their payroll. They will definitely work to keep administration values low too by buying or harassing judges. <br/></i></blockquote>\nWhat do you think? Would you add or change parameters? What about the shifting? I tried to put some sense in it based on some articles I found on the web, but winged a couple of things a bit too, so I'm all ears for something more reasonable if you can explain it in short, even if it complicates the mechanic a bit.<br/><br/>Edit: I totally advocate for keeping a spread for these values for both fronts and areas, and update it each session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468642/#Comment_468642" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-29T05:44:30+00:00" title="December 29, 2017  5:44AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take a look at Reign too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469263/#Comment_469263" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-24T23:05:14+00:00" title="January 24, 2018 11:05PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Lisa!

It's doable if we could prompt the player's input with the right questions and had some direction to start making this kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Like, maybe generating events related with a single deity could do the trick? On a previous version of the cooperative worldbuilder two of the questions about gods were:<br/>-How is the adoration of this deity performed? Is it a festival, a secret meeting, is it performed in temples or outdoors?<br/>-How does this deity punishes those who go against him?<br/><br/>Link these to the chosen deity's domain and you could end up with a few bits of cool mythos. What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469275/#Comment_469275" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-25T13:30:17+00:00" title="January 25, 2018  1:30PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it really depends on what you're going for, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Currently, that part of your sheet seems to assume a kind of "meaningful/relevant polytheism" of multiple "gods" with an impact on real-world events. That sounds like a D&amp;Dism to me - I can't really see that being relevant to a horror game or a modern-world game or a science fiction game or any fantasy which doesn't have multiple gods (e.g. Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc).<br/><br/>I have no idea why it's important to talk about "gods and their adoration" as part of world-building. I like the idea of including them in Fronts or Culture or something like that - ok, is there something in this world which might be religiously motivated? Let's explore that some more.<br/><br/>But maybe some sort of "relevant polytheism" is always important in your home games for some reason that isn't known to me, so that's just part of what you're looking for.<br/><br/>For me, though, I'd want any kind of setting brainstorm technique to work for, say, a crime mystery thriller game, or perhaps a science fiction game where an advanced wormhole experiment finally proved that god doesn't exist, but that aliens have been trying to communicate with humanity throughout the history of The world and people have been misinterpreting those signals as "divine revelation".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469289/#Comment_469289" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-25T21:13:15+00:00" title="January 25, 2018  9:13PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, you have a point. It wasn't exactly D&amp;Dism but a leftover from a previous version of the tool where players were the gods and given such powers to shape the setting, which got cut too much. I'll switch the Gods part for a brief event generator that came to my mind yesterday in the middle of the night. <br/><br/>Still have to test it though, but it should be able to create brief, unclear rumours of random events that the players can later explore through the game to find out if the information is real, relevant or actually connected in some form. Like, is the recent plague of monsters related to the recently reported stolen new technomagical device? Or is it just a smoke screen for the recent wrongdoings of one of the factions?<br/><br/>Got too much work today but I'll update the tool as soon as I get some free time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469291/#Comment_469291" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-25T21:40:37+00:00" title="January 25, 2018  9:40PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another potentially interesting angle would be to retain that part, but to allow people to interpret the terms "gods" rather loosely.

Right now the generator is loose and simple enough that many different interpretations can be made, though maybe changing the phrases and some concepts on it will make it even more open to interpretations. So far this is what I got:\n<blockquote><br/>Roll 2d6, if the first die is even, the event is either positive, lucky, a good omen, a direct benefit or is perceived as such for some reason. If it's an odd number then it's the opposite. The other die determines the type of the event:<br/><br/>1) Mysterious Dissapearance: It can be a criminal, a feared monster, a cursed object, etc. Or it can be a good person, and innocent, a beloved pet or even a whole Front. So far there's no explanation for this event.<br/><br/>2) This wasn't here yesterday: Something obvious has change in the world. Choose a Front or one of the places of interest you've created. Either it wasn't like this until recently or it has practically appeared from nowhere.<br/><br/>3) Portent: Either a miracle or a curse, the apparent nature and scope of this event defies all explanation. Superstitious people say it's the work of a mythical being.<br/><br/>4) Disaster: maybe it just barely missed the region or hasn't happened yet and something can be done about it. Or, if negative, perhaps it has struck with all it's might an unprepared community. Drought, War, Famine, Disease, Flood, Wildfire, Eruption, Earthquake, Hurricane, Swarm, etc.<br/><br/>5) Crime: If positive it means the justice has already been served, if negative they are still free. Murder, Theft, Kidnapping, Sacrilege, Corruption, Smuggling, Difamation, Blackmail, Scam, etc. Mix crimes and exaggerate; the crime is discussed everiwhere for a reason. Point one or more victims, suspects, and the proof presented against them.<br/><br/>6) Unique Opportunity: If positive it means the whole community is moving towards it. If negative everyone is fearing the consequences if someone gets it. It can be a gold rush, or a rumour of a valuable thing unguarded and hidden very close. It must be temting enough that everyone is looking out for it, like a really big amount of money inside a case, a coveted magical artifact, the plans of a new and revolutionary device for which a faction is offering a reward, a jewel, a place of legend, etc. It's a chance for quick money that would change anybody's life.<br/><br/>You can use this table, choose anything you find interesting, bring any premise from any movie, book, series, etc or come up with your own; but it's reccomended that you put together no more than three events. Players should provide their own reasons why their characters are directly involved or interested on any of these events, after all, finding out if the information is reliable, if these events are actually connected or if there are clues or witnesses anywhere, etc it's up to the players in the course of the game.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469474/#Comment_469474" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-30T17:19:23+00:00" title="January 30, 2018  5:19PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, finally included the events random table <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2018/01/30/setting-brainstorming-sheet-version-1-1/" rel="nofollow">on the new version</a>.
