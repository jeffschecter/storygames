What does that actually mean? It's not like lifting crates, or writing tedious and routine business letters, or papering a wall, is it? Well, I've learnt over the last few weeks that the expression 'working on a game' means exactly that. Don't get me wrong, I love working on my games, but this is the first time I've ever had to (a) do a huge amount of research, and (b) edit down the results of that research (which in most cases - these are character sheets we're talking about, but eventually there'll be a section summarising the background to the game - came to about a dozen closely written pages).<br/><br/>It's been very hard work in fact, and I've put it off more times than I care to remember. However, one positive side-effect has been that I've begun to feel like a professional game designer, rather than some dippy hippy putting together a piece of ephemeral nonsense. I'm quite proud of all the research and editing I've done, and I think the game stands a chance of becoming, if not a timeless classic, at least a solid gaming artefact. We have yet to see how it stands up under playtesting, clearly, but I'm quietly confident on that front.<br/><br/>So, the lesson? Put in the hard yards and you (and the book-buying public) will be rewarded. Make it so folks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
