Entitled, 'A Head of His Time' the scenario placed Andrew Mellon and his family in the midst of the controversy between Joseph Duveen and Bernard Berenson over the correct attribution of the painting, Adoration of the Shepherds.  I've been toying with this scenario for years and somehow Cthulhu Dark made it work the way I hoped it would.

Thanks, Mel.<br/><br/>You're certainly right that Cthulhu Dark isn't a no prep game. It's intended to let people run their own scenarios with a minimum of fuss. That's really the whole philosophy behind it: I know how much people enjoy writing scenarios, so I want the system to let them run it (while offering some mechanic impetus to make things get scary).<br/><br/>I'd love to play one of your games at some point. Please do grab me at the next convention we're both at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388973/#Comment_388973" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T18:59:42+00:00" title="August 31, 2012  6:59PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2012 7:00PM by Mel_White.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/>It was great fun prepping the game, running it, and now talking about it.

Here is a genuine example:<br/><br/><i>Graham: Okay, so you're attacking him. What do you want?<br/>Player 1: I want him to drag him out of the hall.<br/>Graham: Right, and what do you want?<br/>Player 2: I want to sacrifice myself to the creatures.<br/>Graham: Right, so do an opposed roll for that.</i><br/><br/>It's implicit, in this, that once you've rolled, you can't try again. Once Player 2 has begun sacrificing himself, Player 1 can't continue trying to drag him out of the hall. Well, he <i>can</i>, but mechanically, it's been decided, so narratively, we know he's going to fail. <br/><br/>Combat gets complicated in Cthulhu games. I've once had a conflict between Investigator A trying to shoot themselves and Investigator B trying to stop them. You don't want to handle that using To Hit and Damage rolls. They just don't work.<br/><br/>Oh, here is an important thing. The central combat rule is technically true: <i>If you try to fight a creature, you will die.</i>. But that's only if you're trying to kill the creature. You can fight your way <i>past</i> a creature or fight your way <i>free</i> from a creature's grasp or perhaps even fight a creature <i>back</i>.<br/><br/>Thanks, Mel.

In the two 'fights' in the adventure, one was to escape Berenson and his ghoul servitors.  The second was to rescue Andrew Mellon.  In neither case was the enemy permanently removed as a threat.  The escape split the characters, leaving them hunted in chthonic chambers; while the rescue left the enemy vowing revenge.  <br/>What was interesting is that some characters will be more prone to fighting due to the character concept; other characters will be more likely to hide or to flee, while still others will freeze in panic.  So the action of the character is just a special effect of the die roll.  For some, their escape is done through fighting their way out.  Others just run. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389005/#Comment_389005" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-01T11:12:56+00:00" title="September  1, 2012 11:12AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense.
