<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>This is different than house rules because house rules are things that I <em>have</em> changed. Most of my house rules on the DM side, things that the game don’t really address such as “who does the monster attack?” or things that are unclearly written, and just a few things on the player side, such as removing a few of the skills and nerfing a few of the spells (Light, Goodberry, Dancing Lights).</p><p>No… this is for things that I have <em>not</em> changed, that I only dream about.<br/>If a thing is on here, it’s because I think the cost of making the change is bigger than the value I gain from the change.</p><p>Changes that are so big that if I were to make them… at some point, I’m no longer playing 5e…?</p><h2 id="no-more-d20-bonus-vs-target-number">No more “d20 + bonus vs target number”</h2><p>What? It’s been that way since 3e and I want to rip it out?</p><p>Yeah. I’m not <em>gonna</em>, but this thread isn’t for things that I have or will change. It’s for things I would <em>like</em> to change, but won’t.</p><p>I just really really like the way ACKS does it better. You add your own “badness” (it descends as you go up in level) with the monster’s (ascending, but single digit) AC and you roll over it. It works similar to how saving throws worked in B/X, but for attacks.</p><h2 id="no-more-differentiation-between-saves-checks-and-rolls">No more differentiation between saves, checks and rolls</h2><p>In 5e, there are saving throws, ability checks, and attack rolls. If you use the “players roll all dice” UA, and we do, there is also “defense rolls”. These four are the same, mechanically, but different abilities work on them. For example, <a href="https://open5e.com/spellcasting/spells_a-z/b/bless" rel="nofollow">bless</a> works on saving throws and attack rolls, but not ability checks and defense rolls. Whereas <a href="https://open5e.com/spellcasting/spells_a-z/g/guidance" rel="nofollow">guidance</a> <strong>only</strong> work on ability checks. This is popular design in card games, like Netrunner has meat and net damage that work exactly the same way mechanically, except that some cards deal net damage and some cards prevent net damage and some cards deal meat damage and some cards prevent meat damage.</p><p>Yeees… it’s good that the SIS cares about which part of the character sheet it engages. Buuut… it is so confusing <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></p><p>If I would’ve made my own game I would’ve just had the six abilities and that would’ve been fine. Saves, attacks, ability checks, all working the same way. Kinda like The Black Hack but roll over, not under.</p><h2 id="no-more-polyhedral-set">No more polyhedral set</h2><p>I’d use five dice. Four Fate dice (those are d3’s numbered plus, blank and minus. I used to be the last defender [you know I love you, SOS] of the name “fudge” dice for these but the word is just so overloaded b/c dice fudging exists) and one d20. It’s good if each player has these.</p><h3 id="for-ability-mods">For ability mods</h3><p>No more both having score and modifier.</p><p>To generate, roll 4dF drop the lowest six times and arrange in any order.<br/><a href="https://anydice.com/program/1499e" rel="nofollow">It gives pretty much exactly the same probabilities as 5e</a>, I realized that today and that was what prompted me to do this writeup.</p><h3 id="for-damage-rolls">For damage rolls</h3><p>A pre-written number +4dF, duh. And for henches, monsters etc, adding the 4dF is optional. (To convert weapons: average on die + your mod.)</p><p>I.e. a rapier in 5e is 1d8+3 if you have +3 dex.</p><p>In this proposed system, if you have +3 dex, it’d be 8+4dF. <a href="Close%20enough!" rel="nofollow">https://anydice.com/program/1499f</a> And, nicely since HP loss is a scalar value, it’s less “swingy”. (I swear, if I hear one more time that the d20 boolean check is “swingy”, I’m gonna… sigh deeply, buckle up and write another rebuttal I guess.)</p><p>Allows a wide variety of damages with a bit of variety added.</p><h2 id="rename-hp">Rename HP</h2><p>“Death Clock!”</p><h2 id="wis-should-not-be-willpower-cha-should">Wis should not be willpower – cha should</h2><p>(Including for morale checks – it’s not “wise” to fight to the death, but it looks cool af, hence cha.)</p><p>I talked to Mearls about this one and he kinda agreed (or he was being polite).</p><h2 id="no-more-classic-six-abilities">No more classic six abilities</h2><p>This one I’m actually not so sure I would change even if I <em>were</em> making my own game. Nostalgia is a powerful drug for me and I do like the orig six because it makes me feel like I’m playing D&amp;D for real.</p><p>But, well…</p><h3 id="if-im-keeping-six">If I’m keeping six:</h3><ul><li>Int → Book learning</li><li>Wis → Perception</li><li>Cha → Sense of self</li></ul><p>I always thought wis and int should’ve swapped names.

We needed this since day one! This is going in! (Example: Targets in Areas of Effect, Lingering Injuries.)</li><li>OK, this’ll be useful once we get to that situation. (Example: These weather rules are much better than 2e’s weather rules.)</li><li>Eww, these were not what I expected (pro fudging advice, or the plot point rules which I was really looking forward to but ended up not working very well at all)</li><li>Oh… if only we had the DMG earlier, I would’ve used this rule, or if it had been the default. As it is, it’s kinda too late to change to it.</li></ol><p>And for me, the one rule that qualifies for that fourth category… is the rule to get rid of skills on p 263.</p><p>I actually never looked as closely at it, maybe this <em>wouldn’t</em> be such a hard sell. They still get to add their prof bonus, except to all rolls w/ the ability. And it would’ve simplified my life as DM a lot (except now I’ve already learned all the skills and wrote house rules for them etc).</p> </div>

It costs five MP.<br/><br/>The spell point system in the DMG (p 288) for some reason has you buy slots for points and then use slots. Wait what?!?!

You'd still have to keep track of how many spells of each level you've cast etc. In other words—would rather use slots.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that I would've wanted to cook up some MP system from the ground up.

I'm kind of curious why that appeals to you, is it aesthetics (I'm not sure what I'm trying to say with that word)? One of my players really enjoyed sorcery points from 5e in a way that I didn't really understand. <br/><br/>I know you haven't designed this system yet or anything but what do you think the lowest denomination of MP would represent? Like is 1 MP enough to cast a lvl 1 spell? Or do you end up in a nickels and pennies situation where you have MP but just not enough to do anything with it... (actually I could imagine that having a sort of appeal)<br/><br/>I would be pretty into a system where casting magic is very difficult (basically requiring a high roll) and you spend MP to modify your roll. Dungeon Crawl Classics basically has something like this where each spell is a table that you roll against with different tiers of effects. In that game you can burn off physical stats to modify your rolls (it's meant to represent blood sacrifice, or rapid aging as a cost for ensuring your spell succeeds).                        </div>

                            This is a great thread, Sandra. It's fun to see how people would do "their own D&amp;D"!<br/><br/>I have some questions for you:<br/><br/>1. How does "players roll all the dice" work when it's PC vs. PC? Do you just return to the standard rules for that? (But doesn't that sometimes mean that you won't have the right numbers written down?)<br/><br/>2. I don't own a DMG or have that anywhere near: what's the gist of "no skills" - how does it work? - and why do you prefer that to the game as written?<br/><br/>3. Your musings on spell casting are... not exactly uncommon, as I'm sure you know. I've seen three approaches that I find pretty satisfying:<br/><br/>The first is to make spells an interesting enough sub-system that having unique spells is fun in its own way (like that example from DCC). I'm doing a variation of that for my own house D&amp;D: each spell has a variety of ways it can "go wrong" or be cast differently, and if you're not a good spellcaster, you can't control that. As a more experienced spellcaster, though, you get to have better control over this, so not only do your spells get more reliable, but they also get to be more versatile.<br/><br/>The second is to remove spell levels: instead, a spell is a spell. Instead, the power of the spell depends on the level of the caster. So, for instance, anyone can cast a Fireball - it's just that the archmage's is a lot bigger. Your power as a wizard is now mostly based on your experience level and the size and variety of your spellbook.<br/><br/>(A friend of mine introduced the idea here, for example:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.necropraxis.com/2013/09/22/spells-without-levels/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.necropraxis.com/2013/09/22/spells-without-levels/</a>)<br/><br/>This simplifies some stuff about the rules, but also removes the need for spell slots (it's much easier to rig up whatever kind of system you want when 1 spell always equals one spell slot, without concern for level!). <br/><br/>The third, which I think is pretty cool, kind of combines the two ideas. You get "spell casting dice". Maybe your wizard has 6 spell casting dice, for instance. They're kind of like hit dice, in that you get them back when you rest or pray or whatever the thing is that you do.<br/><br/>When you cast a spell, you decide how many dice to use, and that determines how effective it is. For a damage spell, maybe you roll all the dice and the total is the damage you deal. For another, it might be the duration ("lasts one turn for each spell casting die used"), or intensity ("mage armor improves your armor class by 1 for each spell casting die used").<br/><br/>Here's the fun part: for each die that rolls [some criteria], that die is lost. The others are retained. So, maybe dice that roll high (4-6) are "spent", but not dice that roll 1 through 3. This means that you might get a handful of really powerful spells one day, but more, weaker spells the next. <br/><br/>Pretty neat, and doesn't need spell slots: so long as you have one die left, and you can always cast something (and maybe you'll lose it and maybe you won't!).<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: Another version of D&amp;D spellcasting I think would work pretty well is if casting spells worked by spending either HP or points from physical stats (maybe just Str and Con), your choice. This would make for some interesting decisions, and casting in safety would be pretty comfortable (just spend your HP!), whereas casting spells under really dangerous circumstances might push your character to exhaust, sicken, or weaken him/herself (to save hit points in order to survive).                        </div>

This is slick. My own D&amp;D formulation is (I think) even more slick, but it does limit the range rather more drastically.<br/><br/>I call it "Blackjack D&amp;D".<br/><br/>Basically, the higher you roll, the better. However, if you roll over your target number or controlling stat, you've "overshot", and it's considered a "miss".<br/><br/>So, you roll and you say, "Oh, darn" (you missed), or you announce your number, "I rolled a [...]!"<br/><br/>The number you roll is what matters - the higher the better. If you and are competing, and I "miss", you win. If we both 'miss', or neither of us does, the person rolling the higher number wins.<br/><br/>A "natural 20" means you've surpassed your own limits, and is an automatic success.<br/><br/>Enemies or obstacles have a rating, and you have to match or beat that rating to defeat them.<br/><br/>So, for example, if you have to make a Strength check against a Bugbear:<br/><br/>You have a Strength of 14.<br/><br/>The Bugbear is strong, so it has a "challenge rating" or whatever we want to call it of 5. You have to roll at least a 5, or you "fail". If you roll higher than 14, you "miss". (Usually these are the same, but sometimes they could be different, to incorporate partial successes, for instance. In those cases, a fail is really bad, but a miss is only partially bad.)<br/><br/>I like this because it includes and preserves all the math we normally do in d20 rolls, but... there's no actual math to do. I think that's pretty cool.<br/> </div>

                            That said (re Blackjack D&amp;D), a few days ago I was running the math for how to implement "hack and slash" a la Dungeon World into 5e and have the math work out. I mean, you're translating 2d20 (400 outcomes) into 1d20 (20 outcomes) so you lose some granularity.<br/>But… I could find numbers that on one roll approximated close enough the chances of only hero hitting, only monster hitting, both hitting &amp; neither hitting.<br/><br/>For example, you had to roll over 11 to hit. If you rolled between 6 and 15, the monster also hit. So you want to roll high as possible (over 15 means only you hit, which is good, under 11 means you don't hit, which is bad) but we don't have to make a separate roll for monsters.<br/><br/>In the end I decided to not implement it, defense rolls &amp; the 5e action econ I think I like better than DW's style.                        </div>

But… maybe this <em>is</em> the ticket. To avoid monster hit, roll over X [depends on the monster’s skill &amp; your armor’s badness] on the ones-digit, and to hit the monster, roll over Y [again, depends on the monster’s armors goodness and your skills badness] on the d20.</p><p>OK yes, I would go with something like that.

In a one hit one kill system you can’t have so many MH results. It should be like… 0.2% chance for a PC being hit &amp; killed. (Over 300 hits that ends up being around 45%.)

                            Oh, that's interesting. I'll have to review your solution here when I'm more awake. It sounds very interesting!<br/><br/>For my Blackjack idea, it's rescued somewhat by the distinction between a "miss" and a "failure". I like using that for differentiation instead of seeing it as a bug. For instance, when defending against a monster, a low roll (a "failure") means you get hit with no defense, whereas on a high roll (a "miss") you are hit but your armour and shield reduce the damage. <br/><br/>Ultimately a clean "roll high" system would be better, but in that case a modern d20+adds seems like an easy way to do it. (I don't like how it makes some ability score differences meaningless, though - in this version every point of an ability matters.)

1. You mean it's weird for you that it's good for YOU when the monster's AC is low? That's interesting; I'd think that for most people understanding "more armour = higher numbers of AC" is fairly intuitive.<br/><br/>2. Oh, I am 100% with you on this one. It's just almost impossible with D&amp;D-esque d20 math. (I can generally achieve it in other designs, though. I have a solid resolution mechanic worked out with d6 pools, for example, that requires no math. But then opposed rolls can be difficult - it's hard to get it all to work! <i>Fudge</i> was pretty groundbreaking in this sense, but even there you didn't get that instant read off the dice.)<br/><br/>I generally prefer comparison of numbers to addition or subtraction. For example, if I understood correctly, in the ACKS system you'd have to ask the GM for the monster's "number", add it to your own number, and then try to roll that number or higher, right?<br/><br/>In "Blackjack D&amp;D", though, you can just roll and call out the number right away. Your opponent (the GM in this case) just tells you whether that matches their number or not - "hit!" or "missed!", no math necessary. That appeals to me - you're just comparing numbers instead of adding or subtracting.<br/><br/>For instance, the GM knows that you need an 8 to hit the ogre. You roll your d20 and call out your result: 5 misses, 9 hits, 12 hits, and so on (unfortunately, 19 misses too, of course, but you don't say that one out loud, you just say, "missed!" instead).<br/><br/>(It also has the advantage of allowing you to keep the "target number" secret, if that's necessary or advantageous for your game. Can facilitate some mechanics!)<br/><br/>3. Yes, mostly true. It's just a question of whether the player can do that mental "flip" in their mind (like how you spoke of seeing the diminishing number - like ThAC0 as a "reduced difficulty"). I'm hoping that the 20 being best and higher numbers being better so long as you don't roll a "miss" will be enough to make it "feel" right.<br/><br/>It might also be possible to rearrange the game so that the PCs generally have much higher numbers, meaning most high rolls are good. (e.g. You must roll under 19 but over 8.)<br/><br/>None of it is ideal, of course.                        </div>

                            Well, interesting! You make a case. I'm not sure I agree - something seems off about this (like, why can't we just invert values to have ascending numbers on both sides, for example?), but I'll ponder it further!                        </div>

                            An inverted value is also known as a subtraction.<br/><br/>So if you have an ascending goodness skill value and an ascending monster value,<br/><br/>you can subtract the goodness skill value from the monster AC to find out your roll-over number.<br/><br/>This is what 3e/4E/5e players already do.<br/><br/>"Oh, I need +3 to hit 15? I'll note 12 here and all my dice over 12 are hits."<br/><br/>Of course, what <i>I</i> like to do as a player when playing 3e/4E/5e is to note my, uh, THAC10 (ACKS style "attack throw" number). It's 10 - my normal to hit, a subtraction I only have to do once. Then I add that number to the last digit of the monster AC [or, strictly speaking, to the monster's AC - 10] and that's my roll over number.<br/><br/>For example, I have +3 to hit. I note down 7.<br/>The DM says "OK the skeleton has AC thi–" (I add the 3 to 7 and note down 10) "–rteen" and then I know that all natural rolls of 10 or higher are hits.                        </div>

This thread is for things that I am not about to house rule or change in 5e because the cost of changing would be too big. (The exception being getting rid of skills completely which we <i>are</i> going to try now. I mean, I've used ACKS-style THAC10 on my end as a player, and before we went to Players Make All Rolls I used it as a DM, but I haven't instituted it as a table-wide policy, it was just my personal shortcut.)<br/><br/>Alignment OTOH is something that I <i>have</i> changed for campaigns where custom alignment was appropriate. My homebrew Glitchworld had three alignments: Civilization, Nature and Glitch.<br/><br/>My next homebrew-in-progress Bladen Faller uses the traditional 9-grid with a pantheon designed around it.
