However, I do not <i>care</i> about it when I buy games - I buy games for their ideas, it's no big deal for me if the execution is a bit rough. I'm easy to please.<br><br>So I might say that I care about playtest in that I do it myself, but I don't mind how others want to make their games. I might feel pity or amusement when somebody's clearly a bit clueless about how his rough product looks like to an outsider, but I also feel sympathy, realizing that people work in different conditions and perhaps there are entirely understandable reasons for why the playtesting was omitted here. Perhaps if I had a burning need to buy more games and a limited amount of money then I could muster some righteous indignitation at being ripped off, but that's just not the way I roll; I get all the games I'm interested in, and it's no big deal if some game needs a bit of fine-tuning to make it run like it's supposed to.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274563/#Comment_274563" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T13:08:49+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  1:08PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last five game purchases:<br><br/>1. <b>How We Came to Live Here:</b> Finally bought this 2 days ago.  I know Brennan playtested the hell out of this game, partially because I did layout for the playtest draft.  Knowing that it was heavily revised and polished definitely game me confidence in my purchase.<br/><br/>2. <b>Lone Wolf Multi-Player:</b> Don't know how extensively this was playtested.  Probably not enough, but oh well.  Bought it anyway.  No regrets but it certainly could be more polished and helpful.<br/><br/>3. <b>Apocalypse World MC Handbook Playtest Draft</b>: Lots of people had playtested this game before I bought it, so I knew it was good and also knew there were still some remaining issues.  Bought it anyway and will buy the finished version as well, which will be even better.<br/><br/>4 &amp; 5. Really not sure what I bought before those.<br/><br/>Personally, knowing a game was playtested thoroughly is not nearly as important to me as WHO it was playtested by.  If Burning Wheel HQ puts out a game, I know it will have nearly all of the issues found and fixed.  If folks that I trust are involved in a playtest and say that the game is great and the issues are being fixed, then that's great too.<br/><br/>If a book has a long list of playtesters, but I don't recognize any of them, that really tells me nothing about the playtest process.  I mean, D&amp;D modules sometimes have loads of playtesters, but the modules still suck.  So you take a chance with products like this, just like ones where it's not clear whether any playtesting was done or not.<br/><br/>Worst of all is if people I know are involved in a playtest, but they tell me that the game really isn't that good or isn't really ready to be published but the author it going forward with it anyway.  I think that's a sign that the playtest environment surrounding the game really isn't working, because the designer really isn't hearing what the playtesters have to say or the playtesters really aren't in the game's target audience.<br/><br/>So I guess my real thoughts are: playtesting is important, but it's even more important if you can get your playtesters talking about the game, how great it is, and what the known problems are.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274564/#Comment_274564" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T13:11:52+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  1:11PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jackson's dedication to playtesting is evidenced even in his forum posts -- check out that subtle iteration!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274569/#Comment_274569" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T13:21:19+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  1:21PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's a secret that testing correlates strongly with good games.

There are others that will push me away. If I hear that it wasn't playtested, and the game is going for more than $10 or so, and there's not a lot of those "pulls", then I'll probably give it a pass.<br/><br/>But as Jason said, there are other factors that lead to impulse buys all the time.<br/>And as Jason said... Yeah, I've gotten burned a few times, too.<br/><br/>I've definitely become timid on buying new games in the past few years, with all sorts of new games coming out from all over, with all different levels of hippyness. And so many excellent free games, too. SO MANY! So I usually wait for looooots of play reports, pokes from friends, people not associated with the game talking about their experiences, etc before I pick the game up.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274575/#Comment_274575" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T13:36:16+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  1:36PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that <i>extensive playtesting</i> is the most important factor in whether or not a game is polished.<br/>I think that it is one factor, alongside:<br/><i>uncritical listening<br/>critical self-evaluation<br/>accepting the help of others<br/>being prepared to kill darlings<br/>being clear about your own goals<br/>effective communication<br/>marketing to the correct audience</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274578/#Comment_274578" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T13:47:37+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  1:47PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I expect that if i buy a game it's been playtested.

I am also aware that playtesting can mean a lot of different things, as a good GM can fix a wobbly game on the fly (and I've loved some wobbly games) and a lousy GM can drag down even a stable game into a lousy play experience. I'm willing to forgive various hiccups, errors, and assumptions provided that a game is clear in its intentions and operations, does <i>some thing</i> very well, and adds to my repertoire as a GM somehow. <br/><br/>I've participated in all manner of playtests, though, and have seen perfectly good games sunk by thin testing, jealous testers, and loaded criticisms. So, in other words, there is sometimes a certain value to the experience that comes with a less-tested game, as it sometimes exposes you to more raw (or flexible, or fresh) ideas. Playtesting can solidify but it can also smooth out and dilute.*<br/><br/>So deciding on playtesting versus purchase, it's a judgment call. I don't think I've ever looked at a playtester list and not purchased something because of it, though. To a certain extent, nothing has been satisfactorily playtested for my group until it's been playtested <i>with</i> my group, you know what I mean?<br/><br/>I like it when options are presented as a result of playtesting, as Pelgrane Press sometimes does. I like it when a designer has logged enough time with a system or scenario that she can speak from experience, not just design, about the shortcomings and strengths, and how to run a game to minimize one and maximize the other. <br/><br/>So, yeah, it's complicated. I've liked some games that really needed more playtesting, and I've disliked (or grown to dislike) some very tightly tested games. <br/><br/>Perhaps I should start a different thread, but I'd love to hear people's takes on how they spot subpar playtesting.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will<br/><br/>*Update: You know what, I should say that <i>a slavish adherence to playtester notes</i> can do these things.

It has to be strongly recommended to me by someone who knows what I like, and<br/>2. I have to have a reasonable expectation that we will be playing the game within the next 6 months.<br/><br/>Although as a practical matter, even when I know that I want the game, I tend to hold off on buying it until the last possible minute, and look for good sales or a used copy or some other way to pay less for it than I normally would.  Maybe when the salary and hiring freezes get lifted, I'll care less about getting a good deal...but I'm still only going to buy things that have been vetted by trusted sources and that are going to get played this year.  No more buying books on spec, no more buying books for one or two good ideas, no more buying books to complete a set.  It gets used, or it gets left at the store.<br/><br/>But somehow, the books that manage to fulfill <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> almost always have a nice fat list of playtest credits in them, even if no one actually specifically looked for that page before recommending it to me.  Apparently I like playtested games.  And that makes sense to me, because I believe that good playtesting can only make a game better.<br/><br/>Now, whether this means that every developer should do extensive playtesting or should make a point of telling people about how their games were playtested, I can't say; it certainly would seem like the virtuous thing to do, and good for the quality of their games.  They'll have to decide if the time, effort, and/or expense is worth it to them, though, because I'm the polar opposite of an alpha consumer.  No sane person should ever base their business model on what I would or would not buy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274657/#Comment_274657" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-05T06:03:11+00:00" title="June  5, 2010  6:03AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If my money is to go into your hands, I expect you to have done the proper work to make a game.
