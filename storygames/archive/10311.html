Especially in games where those interests matter, have opposition, and impact the fiction. I do GM a lot, so that may factor in. But I wonder if acting against my character's interests is a way to ensure I have fun when my interests are not being challenged in an exciting way or a way to ensure the conflict will be one that gives me the best chance to showcase why I like my character.

It's fine if you say to the GM, "You know what would totally suck for my character right now?  If his wife came home," and the GM's eyes lighting up and going, "Dude, you're totally right.  Your wife totally comes home!"  The point being that AFTER that's establish, you say, "You know what he would do?  He'd lie to her face."  And you pick up dice and roll.<br/><br/>What's lame is when you do this: "You know what he'd do?  He'd lie to her face.  But I bet she'd totally see right through it."  Wait what?  Your dude doesn't even get a CHANCE!?  It's lame when GM's do it.  It's equally lame when player's do it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229417/#Comment_229417" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T16:43:20+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  4:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favourite thing to do, especially in Misery Bubblegum, is to make my character <i>want</i> to do something that's bad for them.
