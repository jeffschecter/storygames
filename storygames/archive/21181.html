Later at any time in-game the rules are subject to discussion and change if the players agree to it. How the agreement is reached is up to the circumstances.</i><br/><br/><b>Our priority as a group is __________________________, followed by _______________________ and if the opportunity arises we could consider ____________________________</b><br/><i>(fill these with goals or activities such as treasure hunting, bounty hunting, monster hunting, exploration, conquering the world, getting filthy rich, becoming famous, becoming infamous, murderhobbysm, being heroes, free the people of X, put Y in the throne, etc. Avoid general terms as "adventuring")</i><br/><br/><b>For the sake of fulfilling these goals/activities, keeping the physical and mental integrity of our fellow party members and bulding at least enough trust to properly perform as a group, we will: </b><i>(choose and put in order of importance)</i><br/><br/>-Try your best to protect lives, specially your own.<br/>-Spare those who surrender.<br/>-Shoot first, ask questions later.<br/>-Always protect the nature.<br/>-If it's in the way we bring it down.<br/>-Always help and protect the innocent.<br/>-The only good monster is the dead one.<br/>-Uphold the Law<br/>-Ask first, backstab later.<br/>-Get the treasure, don't fight the monsters.<br/>-Drop the spellcaster first.<br/>-Thin the enemy numbers before entering melee.<br/>-There always has to be a plan and everyone in the party needs to know it at all times.<br/>-Everyone must keep a map.<br/>-One fight at a time.<br/>-Always wear as much armour as you can.

While I see the benefit of having a group conversation and establishing a "mission statement", what makes me more excited is the idea that it would be <i>randomly generated</i> during character creation, to create the "starting company". <br/><br/>Probably something like:<br/><br/>"Here are 20 good adventuring rules. Your company starts with 7 of them - roll to see which. Now, roll two more times: whatever those rules are, write down the opposite motive/guideline."<br/><br/>So, for instance, our team always splits the treasure equally, and everyone keeps a map of the dungeon we're exploring, but stealing things from others is very common, so we're always watching our belongings...<br/><br/>Yours, on the other hand, always forgets to map things, and the leader hands out the treasure however he feels is right - to reward some members while punishing others. But you're very organized in combat, well-supplied, and obey the law at all times.<br/><br/>Over time, as we play longer and further, you'd be able to amend that. A "veteran" group might come to have a carefully vetted and player-defined list, as you suggest, over time. But the starting conditions would be somewhat unpredictable, and reflect the strengths and weaknesses (and herd mentality!) of the existing company.<br/><br/>That gives the GM some ideas for how to play NPCs in the party, as well.<br/><br/>Ideally, to make it interesting, you should have several such "adventuring companies" in your campaign world at a time, with characters occasionally "changing teams".<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my vision! Yours can differ, of course. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464100/#Comment_464100" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T19:37:26+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  7:37PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heheh, nah it's okay, let's go with yours, players can still use this list however they want but I like it better the idea that this could help the GM to generate different adventuring groups.

In 3:16 these roles are given to the players with the higher skills in either combat or non-combat abilities I think. But the deal there is that being a game where the PCs are all in the military, everyone's got their directives:<br/><br/>-Soldiers just have to follow orders<br/>-Then the corporal follows orders AND has to guide and help the soldiers to maximize their efficiency and kill ratio. <br/>-Then the Sergeant has to follow orders, make sure the mission gets accomplished AND that all the soldiers return alive, to the best of his ability.<br/><br/>These simple directions are enough to make clear for the players what are their responsibilities towards the other players and help them roleplay better a more properly organized group. After all, now the chain of command is there for a practical reason, it's part of the game and it has nothing to do with the subconsciously "who's the alpha here" white elephant that shows up every once in a while, that gets tacked upfront at the worst scenario ("You will all follow me or suffer the consequences!") and at best ignored in favor of democracy... or herd stupidity.<br/><br/>I did introduced a bit of democracy on our 3:16 game under the premise that they all had to present their field report after the mission and this could be the basis for having the higher ups demoting the current sergeant to soldier or corporal and ascending another PC for their next mission.<br/><br/>I think something like this could be used here too, have like three or less directives outlined for the Leader so everyone knows what's expected of them, like:<br/><br/>The leader responsibilities in priority order is to make sure that everyone on the party...<br/>-...knows and agrees to why they are doing this and the risks involved.<br/>-...makes it back alive.<br/>-...gets something out of this.<br/><br/>Dunno, what you think? Also, I did some checking on the term "Caller" and found <a href="Also, I did some checking on the term" rel="nofollow">this</a>, so perhaps we should stick to "Leader", as it seems like "Caller" is more of a player role than a character role, though for modern D&amp;D both are probably intertwined.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464223/#Comment_464223" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-21T02:14:40+00:00" title="June 21, 2017  2:14AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the text I use to identify leadership roles. The caller is one of several here\u2014along with a mapper, a logistics/marching-order person, and a planner who has set the overall goals; but often these roles are at least somewhat collapsed so the caller is directing based on their own map, or is managing the marching order. I would not advise giving them more than one secondary task though.\n<blockquote>\u2026the group will organize into one or more Parties. Each Party should have name, and is to be led by a Caller\u2014this is who the referee will look to during combat and other stressful moments to cue the others, so your organization is important. The size of the Party\u2014including Hirelings, Henchfolk, and other npcs\u2014is limited to a maximum equal to the caller\u2019s Charisma score. Each Party should also have one member keep a record of the order that its members walk in, noting if any of them are particularly stealthy, or protected or made invisible by magic. It is advisable that each party also have a member keeping a map to find your way back out, and back to where you left off next time.<br/><br/>In the Dungeon, more Parties moving around making noise will increase the number of dice the referee rolls for Wandering Monsters. On the other hand, it means that the group might be able to complete multiple tasks or make complicated tactical maneuevers. During the course of play it may be required to reassign characters or invent new Parties entirely. Should any of your followers be attacked without the presence of your character, they must check morale immediately\u2014but if they pass they can be commanded by the caller present.</blockquote>\nI do tie leadership to an in-game attribute, with the added note that Fighters get a morale bonus at higher levels which applies on this number (I should update this text to make that clear here). But this is only loose\u2014because the large party is not necessarily the one making the most important actions or decisions when there is more than one, instead there's a thief party taking the treasure or a front-line shield-wall party holding the fight with their own caller who doesn't need those same numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464248/#Comment_464248" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-23T01:26:50+00:00" title="June 23, 2017  1:26AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good comments!
