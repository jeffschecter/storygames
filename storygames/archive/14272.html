I come bearing a Touchstone playbook for Apocalypse World. The Touchstone is a character like Vash the Stampede or Shepherd Book: she's really good at hope, and even better at violence. The Touchstone symbolizes the rebirth of Apocalypse World, and your game will be all the more awesome for having this playbook.<br/><br/>    To get this playbook from me, you must complete a challenge: Do something, anything to make your world a better place.<br/><br/>    This can be anything at all, at any scale: Play with a kid, give money to a homeless guy, have a conversation -- a real conversation -- about your religion or lack of one, give to charity, give someone advice, be a neighbor, make cookies. I don't care what you do, I don't judge it, as long as you think you've made your world a little better by doing it.<br/><br/>    It can be something you would have done anyway, or something you do every day.<br/><br/>    Post about it in this thread or e-mail me at benlehman@gmail.com to let me know. Give me your e-mail and I'll send you the playbook.<br/><br/>    yrs--<br/>    --Ben                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323944/#Comment_323944" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T14:21:41+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  2:21PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I already have the Touchstone, but I want to do something and tell you anyway!<br/><br/>The best thing about this deal is, you can fulfill <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13879&amp;page=2#Comment_317136" rel="nofollow">Elizabeth's Hoarder deal</a> at the same time!<br/><br/>Well OK, the best thing is making the wold a better place.

I gave him two euros because I didn't have anything smaller and started talking with him. I usually give money but don't talk; now I felt that I need to talk to him so that he won't feel even more isolated from everyone.<br/><br/>I found out that he had been an entrepreneur and had had 197 employees at best; then he'd fallen in love with a former amphetamine addict and apparently the woman had fallen back to her old ways and dragged the man with him. Now he'd been drinking for the last 16 years, wept and wished that Jesus would forgive him. I reminded him of God's Grace (although I'm an atheist). He also displayed his rugged hands with which he's more than ready to hit men down if they're trouble; but his black eye had come from him not having booze and falling down the church steps in Tallinn.<br/><br/>After I finished talking with him, a man of maybe 60 years laughed and said that the beggars are always asking for money and that that person tried to ask him, too.<br/><br/>Speaking of religion, I also talked with two American Later Day Saints about religion. I usually tell the missionary types 'no thanks', but this time I didn't.<br/><br/>v                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324781/#Comment_324781" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T14:48:42+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  2:48PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah\u2026 I was kind with and empathized with a perfect stranger at the bar counter today, helping the guy vent some steam.
