Why?  Because the pregen characters with their abbreviated character sheet and the quick start rules REALLY are an excellent short version of the game.  I was somewhat disappointed, having spent this weekend pouring through the PHB, at how complicated the full system really is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a TON of fiddly bits in this game and the full on character sheet is just down right scary.  The things that stand out to me the most as stuff I would have designed differently:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Cut down a bunch on the exceptions and keep more to the core jist of things.  For example, the new duration rules are great.  Instead of tracking rounds and minutes and such you just make a save at the end of your turn to see if you're still affected.  At least that's the core rule.  In fact, there are so many exceptions to this in the PHB powers that its hard to see this as a "core" rule at all.  Some powers last till the end of your next turn, some last to the beginning of someone elses turn, some last to the third alternate tuesday when the moon is full.  Ok I exaggerate, but why have exceptions at all?  Tracking which power ends at what time has the potential to be just as irritating as tracking rounds.  And THEN there are rules that let you change your initiative order (delaying actions and ready actions)...The shear number of words they had to spend explaining what happens to the duration of effects when you futz with your initiative order (seems like they were WAY worried about someone delaying till the end and then getting 2 turns in quick succession) should have been a clue to just not allow you to futz with your initiative order.  The fact that they didn't include any of these rules in the Shadowfell game is a good thing (and should have been their second clue).<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Having bonuses come from a multitude of sources is a good thing.  But when you add on to that that each type of bonus falls into a different category and bonuses from the same category don't stack...now you have an extra thing to track.  Its not enough to know you got +2 from this and +3 from that and +1 from the other.  You also have to track the categories for each...If they're all from different categories you have a +6...if they're all from the same category you have a +3.  If two are the same you have +5 or +3 or +4 (depending on which two).  I guess in the world of D&amp;D; 3.5 munchkins its essential to have such rules to keep the dumbasses from breaking the game...but geezelouise its a crying shame that the rest of us have to pay the price for it.  Since I don't expect any of my players are going to spend the hours of their lives obsessing over rulebook minutia in an effort to squeeze undeserved bonuses into their character...I'm of a mind to say "screw the stacking limit, if they get a couple extra plusses they shouldn't have had whoopty-dee"  Perhaps the categories will become second nature after enough plays...they actually were pretty straight forward categories...but the learning curve is already pretty steep in the full rules relative to the quick start.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149035/#Comment_149035" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T12:22:31+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 12:22PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2008 12:26PM by Valamir.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3) Changing attribute scores.  On the surface I like the notion of increasing attribute scores...but it does mean that nearly the entire character is going to need to be recalculated every time you do it.  Mostly you're going to be increasing scores when they change a modifier, and you're going to be changing modifiers that you use alot, so all of those powers and skills that rely on that attribute for modifiers are going to have to be recalculated.  That seems like a lot of unnecessary fiddlyness to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The range of basic actions you can take on your turn seems really unnecessary.  It looks like they went down the list of stuff you could do in 3.5 with the idea of keeping as much as they could instead of scrapping all the junk and demanding an action justify its own existance.  Things like the "Double Move" are especially egregiously obnoxious.  See you get 1 Move action automatically, and if you want you can demote your standard action to a Move so you can get two Move actions.  So if you want you can take 2 full move actions on your turn.  --OR-- you can do a "Double Move" which has a bunch of other restrictions and seems to exist for the sole purpose of allowing you to add your two moves into 1 bigger move instead of 2 seperate moves so that you don't get hurt from rounding down twice when moving through difficult terrain.  Christ on a cracker.  So some slow character who has a odd movement rate can move through 5 spaces of difficult terrain instead of 4 on their turn, they added 3/4s of a column worth of text.  GAH.  The PHB is full of stuff like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Charge Action is also irritating.  I can already do a full move and then an attack...why do I need another special action called a charge?  Now I have fiddly things to remember like the limit of what space I'm allowed to charge to, the requirement to move at least 2 spaces, and a freebee +1 to-hit (that last is especially annoying...why not just call it a "Combat Advantage" accept it as a +2 like all the other combat advantages instead of making us remember that this bonus is only +1).  Now I know why the Charge Action is important...because the Surprise rules only give the surprising party a single action (basically attack OR move but not both)\u2026so if you want to move and attack as the ambusher you need to Charge.  How much cleaner would it have been to just let the ambush round be a regular old full round, and if someone wants to charge they can just move and attack normally without needing special rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other actions like this that could have been greatly simplified (and mostly were for the quick start rules).<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Feats, the feats are pretty inconsistent.  Some of them are like \u201choly crap, I can do all that just for taking this feat?\u201d  Others are like \u201cBig whoop, why would I waste a feat on that\u201d.  Allowing for the likelihood that some of the big whoops actually are more useful than I\u2019m able to ascertain just from reading\u2026some are clearly not\u2026like powers that only activate when a critical is scored.  I\u2019m also not really sure what the feats add.  You\u2019ve got Racial Powers, Class Powers, Powers from magic items, and Powers from Feats.  Not all feats provide powers but many do\u2026that kinda sorta makes sense if there are some powers that are class specific or race specific and others that anyone can take if they take the feat\u2026but that\u2019s typically NOT the case.  There are quite a few class specific feats that provide powers.  Huh?  WTF.  If they\u2019re class specific just make them freaking class powers to begin with.  The whole feat system throws a TON of unnecessary fiddly schtuff into the game, especially character creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149036/#Comment_149036" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T12:22:53+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 12:22PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2008 12:29PM by Valamir.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            6) Rituals I was initially very excited about.  Take all of the spells that go boom\u2026turn them into attack powers.  Take all of the spells that let you do cool things in a battle and turn them into utility powers.  Take all of the other spells and make them rituals.  You keep your rituals in your spell book.  All seems sensible so far.  But then they throw a couple of bizarre wrenches into the works.  First some of the rituals take ridiculous amounts of time to cast\u2026ok, I get it\u2026they\u2019re rituals.  But then clearly some of those rituals (like Knock) would have been better served as Utility powers\u2026cause who in the heck is going to spend that kind of time opening a lock?  The bigger and far worse wrench, however, is spell components.  Spell components have been around since 1E.  They were obnoxious pointless and stupid then, and they\u2019re obnoxious pointless and stupid now.  The difference is that then, you just ignored them.  Now they are an integral factor into the way rituals are balanced.  See in order to cast a ritual you have to spend gold\u2026oh, I\u2019m sorry you have to have purchased large amounts of spell components.  Some rituals that seem to have fairly minimal one time effects can cost as much as 45,000 gps to cast.  Huh?  Lets see\u2026buy a kick ass magic item that\u2019s far more useful than that and works over and over again\u2026or spend way more for a 1 shot spell.   This is the first rule that strikes me as \u201cno one ever actually playtested this rule\u201d in the game.  The others\u2026okay\u2026they\u2019re a different design philosophy than I would have used but I can see the logic behind them.  This, this is just dum.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) The magic item economy.  Ok.  D&amp;D; isn\u2019t a simulation, I get it.  But some things are just sensible.  In order to buy something you have to have someone willing to sell it.  When you pay that someone you pay them the gold and they receive the gold.  Unless you\u2019re trading a D&amp;D; magic item that is.  If you\u2019re trading a D&amp;D; magic item you buy a magic item for full price, but sell it for only \xbd price.  Ummm\u2026come again?  If I pay 10,000 gps for a magic sword, that means the seller received 10,000 gps for the magic sword.  But if I want to sell the magic sword\u2026I only get 5000 gps for it.  Presumeably then the NPC who bought it can sell it to someone else for 10,000 gps\u2026right\u2026so I\u2019ll just wait and find that guy and sell my sword to him directly\u2026how about that.  Nope.  The rules are EXTREMELY clear on this (to the point of having several text boxes to clarify)...that\u2019s REALLY dum.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut wait, it gets better.  If you\u2019re a wizard you can use up valuable feat slots to gain the ability to enchant magic items.  Of course you have to pay for the materials\u2026but get this, the materials cost the same as the full price of the item.  So I can make my own magic sword\u2026but it will cost me 10,000 gps to do it\u2026the rules actually go out of their way to say that its better to just BUY the sword.  Umm, why then would I waste a feat on being able to make one myself.  And further\u2026why then would there be magic swords for sale.  If it costs some wizard 10,000 gps to make a sword\u2026and they can then only sell it to me for 10,000 gps\u2026then essentially all their hours of labor was\u2026free?  How does that work.  Scrolls work the same way.  Buy a scroll for 1000 gps or copy it yourself for 1000gps\u2026potions\u2026yep, same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I can see how they didn\u2019t want wizards to become money making machines by simply creating enchanted items and selling them like some merchant\u2026but my god, there are better ways of accomplishing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nConclusion:  Ok, no despite all these negatives, my ardor for getting to actually play this game has not diminished.  But it has disappointed me.  The quick start rules are actually WAY better (except for the couple three things they referenced but forgot to explain) then the full rules.  The idea that the designers may have actually created a fast playing streamlined engine of fun now has to be measured against a fair amount of head scratching...WTFs.  But, that said, I suppose the number of WTFs pales in comparison to the mess that was 2ed or the huge sprawling morass that was 3E.  But man-o-man\u2026to come SOOOO close and fall short can sting way more then just being totally off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what this means for me is that to have a hope in hell of playing this with my group I\u2019m going to need cards.  Cards for all the powers, including the feat powers.  Cards for all the rituals.  And especially cards for all the basic actions (like second wind, and bull rush).  There just isn\u2019t enough (any) space on the character sheet to write down any details of these things, and there\u2019s no way anyone is going to remember them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149037/#Comment_149037" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T12:23:03+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 12:23PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2008 12:30PM by Valamir.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Further, creating characters is right out.  You have to be really into old school min-maxing character creation to want to create a character in 4E.  My group likes the character creation rules of In a Wicked Age, or Grey Ranks, or 1001 Nights.  Agonizing over feat selection is not gonna go over well, at least not right out of the gate.  Plus, without actual play the choices are largely opaque.  So I figure\u2026pregen characters from Shadowfell absolutely.

D&amp;D4, for all its streamlined-ness, is still part of the school of design that says "Throw a bunch of rules at it and groups will decide what sticks."  They're expecting play groups to act as a filter for a lot of that stuff, deciding which elements are fun and interesting and which stuff will be ignored.  The quickstart may fool folks into thinking they've caught the Dread Indie Disease and only included rules that they expect people to actually use all the time.  But that's clearly not the case, as you can see when reading the core books.  It definitely sucks, if you come from a Diseased perspective and don't want to spend hours of your life figuring out whether you like XYZ sets of rules or whether they are, in fact, optional or whether they will cause all sorts of other problems when you take them out.<br><br>But... for your purposes, Mike, where minor or even major advantages here and there don't really matter, where you can compensate for one lop-sided fight by making the next one tougher or easier or what have you, where you can renegotiate what an ability does after you've played with it for a bit, then it doesn't really kill your game, it just means you spend more time worrying about the rules than you'd ideally like, more time that you're used to in most of the Diseased games we've been playing.  So yeah, really lame in some ways, but D&amp;D4 was never going to be the crunchy version of Agon that many of us were hoping for, I don't think.  Guess we'll have to hack that together ourselves.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149068/#Comment_149068" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T13:17:08+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  1:17PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>There's a TON of fiddly bits in this game and the full on character sheet is just down right scary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>On the surface I like the notion of increasing attribute scores...but it does mean that nearly the entire character is going to need to be recalculated every time you do it.</blockquote>\nI had the exact same reaction.

The worksheets is where I keep all my ability scores, my armor class components, my feat lists, keep track of how my skill ads are made up, possible "future feats/powers I'm interested in grabbing", personality/motivations, etc. This sheet will be about 2-3 pages long. Then, I'll have a Character Sheet which simply posts the total of all that other stuff. My armor class will be one number. My skills will just say "+x".

I'd just start twitching then if I had to play in like an RPGA game where the rules must be followed-as-written. But for home games, I can see all sorts of potential for classic-style houserulin'. :-)<br><br>One of the things I noticed after bombing my Daily twice for my Warlord (make an attack, if you hit you do 3x damage, and your party gets +1 on all defenses for the rest of combat; either way they also get X temp HP) is that the really kick-ass abilities require you to hit on an attack roll, and they are not "Reliable" (that is, you can try again if you don't succeed). And unfortunately, the badass monsters that you want to use these abilities on all will usually have really high AC. And unfortunately, the Warlord doesn't have a lot of (or any?) abilities to buff ones own attack score. So the chance of the badass dailies actually succeeding seems really slim. Meanwhile the 1st level rogue is doing like 30+ dpr. :-)<br><br>So some thoughts I've had for houseruling (after seeing how it works for another session or two):<br>Make more dailies "Reliable". Hmmm. Probably has a high unbalancing effect.<br>Allow the Warlord to use their dailies on other people. Like, "I grant the Ranger my X ability. On your next attack, Ranger!"... seems to fit in with the Warlord image more.<br><br>In any case, it was kinda weird having some badass Warlord abilities, however:<br>* Many of them (including instants) required hitting a target. Most targets that you'd want to use them on have high AC, which means its much harder to make use of these abilities.<br>* None of them are Reliable<br>* Warlord has no buffs to make their own chance to attack with a future hit easier (unlike other classes, like the strikers).<br><br>So you end up rolling to hit for encounter or daily abilities, and even for a pretty well built character, no matter what level (as the enemy AC will increase as you increase in level), you're hoping for a 1-in-4 chance on average to have them work.<br><br>Heh, I'll probably bring this up on another board though to ask for solutions (RPGNet D&amp;D, etc).<br><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149082/#Comment_149082" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T14:10:16+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  2:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There just needs to be a way to spend Healing Surges to grant a bonus an a roll, methinks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149083/#Comment_149083" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T14:10:35+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  2:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, there also are already fillable charsheets that do the calculations themselves in pdf... and you can save them, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149084/#Comment_149084" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T14:16:53+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  2:16PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Complexity that doesn't add more fun to a game than it kills is the fecund kudzu of game design. It's like it comes from nowhere as you're working on a game. You identify a problem, and fix it with a rule. Lather, rinse, repeat, and pretty soon you've got live kudzu and dead fun.<br/><br/>It seems to me the success of 4e depends on the answer to three questions:<br/><br/>1. Are people going to want to play it<br/>2. Are people going to want to run it<br/>3. Are people going to want to design for it<br/><br/>We played some of Keep on the Shadowfell yesterday. If the full game plays like Shadowfell, no doubt in my mind the answer to all three questions is yes. The great challenge of designing a face-to-face RPG is designing the social landscape. It's clear from just three combat encounters that Shadowfell nails it. Does the Dragonborn Paladin do her roar (or whatever the hell it is) if a wounded comrade will be caught in the effect? Do I use a Healing Surge now, or power through and hope my next attack takes the opponent down? The social concern of personally demonstrating effectiveness, playing for the good of the team, winning, losing, aiding each other, all collide and clash to produce meaningful personal and social rewards and consequences for fun gameplay. Shadowfell felt like a "just the good parts" version of my heaviest D&amp;D phase (basically, when I was in high school). And there was no kudzu. Just fun.

It looks like this isn't an issue now, except once every other level.<br/><br/>5.  Feats have always been pretty inconsistent.  Frankly, why bother with Feats at all?  Fold that stuff into your class features or powers.<br/><br/>7.  The economy - apparently this has been ridiculous in the past too.<br/><br/>Also, creating characters in 4e is <i>enormously</i> faster and more efficient than doing it in 3.X.  Inspired by Ryan's E6 hack, I tried fooling around with basic 5th level PC's in 3.5, and figuring out all their stuff took a <i>long</i> time.  Building NPC's and monsters was a huge drag.  To make matters worse, I'm one of those guys who says, "Hey, they went to a lot of trouble to make these particular sub-systems internally consistent - let me figure out what the DC for this skill really ought to be, or let me figure out what a Wizard's Tower really ought to have inside it based on these rules."  It was amazingly plausible, but also a huge amount of time at the design stage.  In 4e, a lot of that stuff is much faster and easier, even if the implications are really bizarre.<br/><br/>So what looks like kludgey, inefficient, patch-driven design in 4e appears as a huge relief when compared to the even more inefficient, patch-driven design in 3.5, and apparently it's much faster in play (though, to me, still achingly slow). <br/><br/>Mainly what 4e does for me, is make me reach for my copy of <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149100/#Comment_149100" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T15:04:08+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  3:04PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2008 3:05PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of our house rules is: Spend an Action Point to re-roll any number of dice you just rolled.

One of the balancing features of doing an extended rest is resetting the AP total, but that doesn't seem like that big of a deal if you can only spend 1 AP per encounter anyway.  I mean if you do 4 encounters before resting and you save all your APs you'd have 3 APs for the last encounter.  Is that really a game breaker?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had thought perhaps there could be multiple uses of APs and each use could only be done once:  Like extra action once, use a paragon path power once...I had thought maybe allowing another Second Wind once...your reroll would be another like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAPs are another area I neglected to list above.  They seem kind of sketchy to me...like one more thing to keep track of the game didn't really need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149107/#Comment_149107" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T15:21:17+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  3:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our first house rule: Spend as many APs at once as you want.<br><br>Also: Spend an AP to give an auto +2 aid to another's roll.<br><br>Also: You can act out of turn to do Aid Another.<br><br>Spending APs as much as you want makes the game way better.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149108/#Comment_149108" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T15:21:25+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  3:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've found on the web that someone has already put together power cards and one of my group who's a bit of an expert in graphic design has shrunk all these down to business card size.

You know how you have quick starts? I'd call the PHB the D&amp;D <i>slow</i> start. The amount of stuff you have to learn before you can play will mean a long gap between purchase and actual play. That, or make it up as you go play - but why buy rules if your going to be bewildered by them and not actually use them?<br/><br/>I remember the board game 'Warhammer quest'. It had a ton of rules, but it had one sheet which told you to set up a barbarian, five goblins, and what to roll for attacks for a demo fight. And I did indeed set it up, because it was so simple to do. In five minutes you were slaying stuff (it was a slaying game). There, some pay off straight away.<br/><br/>The PHB seems to want to give a ton of technical information, with nothing towards payoff right now. Keep on the shadowfell sounds like it has payoff now - the PHB's design seems slightly skitzoid in that it avoids payoff now entirely.<br/><br/>Mind you, I suppose 3.x was that way - I didn't notice as much because the rules were different and new, so there was some payoff in reading them. But since this book works from a very similar structure, that payoff is largely absent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149170/#Comment_149170" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T19:25:17+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  7:25PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>The Charge Action is also irritating.

I kind of prefer that to 3.5, where you had to sacrifice XP, i.e., nobody ever made their own items. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Instead of tracking rounds and minutes and such you just make a save at the end of your turn to see if you're still affected.  At least that's the core rule.  In fact, there are so many exceptions to this in the PHB powers that its hard to see this as a "core" rule at all.  Some powers last till the end of your next turn, some last to the beginning of someone elses turn, some last to the third alternate tuesday when the moon is full.  Ok I exaggerate, but why have exceptions at all?</blockquote>\nSaves are usually for attack powers that affect someone else. Otherwise, durations are typically until the beginning or end of your next turn, or for the whole encounter.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Changing attribute scores</blockquote>\nHey, at least now it's only when you hit certain levels. You're adjusting many scores every level simply for that reason alone (+level/2 figures into a lot of stats). That's way easier than ability damage in 3.5, which was just about the suckiest thing ever.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Huh?  WTF.

For the most part, feats grant some permanent bonus (sorta like Die Traits from BW!), so it's pre-game math. Not too bad. And feats are cool!

My guy is a "deceptive warlock".  <br/><br/>I have nothing good to say about the PHB's organization or the one page (!) index.  A one page index for a tome of that magnitude is like a deliberate thumb in the eye.  I have nothing good to say about the default character sheet but many bad things to say, like "what the fuck?  This makes everything harder.  Where are the nicely arranged Shadowfell character sheets?"<br/><br/>I'll concur with those who expressed sadness at the whiff factor of the cool powers - I used all my awesome to 100% no effect.  Without them my guy is weak and small, so I was hoping to make a satisfying, lasting impression with them.  I am dogged by bad luck.<br/><br/>That said, once we had made our guys we breezed through a simple combat encounter without any major hitches.

So that's one problem for which we simply haven't seen the final design yet.<br/><br/>As far as Rituals go, I think it's important to consider most Rituals are <i>supposed</i> to be the bad choice.  They are your last resort, such as if absolutely <i>no one</i> in the party has a high enough skill or power.  Knock is a poor substitute for Thievery, and the Wizard, the Cleric, and the Ritual feat (a mere feat!) are balanced with that in mind.<br/><br/>As a hardcore D&amp;Der, only two things really bothered me:<br/><br/>1) How quickly we discovered some broken powers and combinations of powers.  But one nice thing about the powers and retraining mechanics are that a DM can just say, "Okay, I'm not allowing that again," without screwing the player over.<br/><br/>2) The <i>completely</i> broken Skill Challenge math.

On the plus side...and I consider this a HUGE plus...I've not seen a better discussion of what the DM's job is.  You'd be hard put to find a situation arise in play that the DMG doesn't have some advise on.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortuneatly some of that advise is just bad.  Not just bad from my personal preference side, but bad as in exactly opposite of the goals of the game.  Specifically I'm talking about the regular and repeated Illusionist advice...which is just devastating to the sort of tactical play that 4E is focused on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a bunch of it.  But the two deal breakers for me are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) "Don't let rituals short circuit your encounter".  The text goes on to tell the DM that if the players have access to rituals like scrying that would give them information that would render an encounter too easy...that's its a simple matter to just not let the ritual work ("they didn't give a specific enough description of what they wanted").  If you combine this with earlier advice to not conceal important "move the game forward" information from the players it makes those information gathering rituals completely useless.  You're always going to get only the info the DM wants you to have...if you don't have the ritual, the DM is instructed to give you the information he wants you to have.  If you do have the ritual, the GM is instructed to limit you to only the information he wants you to have.  LAME.  That makes the ritual completely a waste of a slot...in which case it shouldn't exist in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) "Let the villain escape".  This is the really horrible one.  "If you need the villain to escape and the players have come up with a clever way to stop him...simply give him some new capability the players don't know about"  Wow...that is the suck.

Think of them more like a scripted event: They appear for the first round, but before anyone can act they disappear/hide/vanish. Anything on the mat is the equivalent of putting it at risk. Having a badass villain charge into combat, whack at the players, then vanish before they can be cut down/captured by rule-breaking "Elminstmechanics"... that's lame. Take them out, only to let the players find that this isn't the real villain, just a "mid-boss". Have the villain have a lieutenant who is the one who actually wades into combat while the real villain vanishes on the first round as per scripted event.<br><br>2) If you must have some character get away to progress the storyline, just tell the players. Give them all a free Action Point for playing along with your story-yank or something.<br><br>In terms of balance, it doesn't seem right. If the players can't suddenly escape a battle and be saved from a TPK by a clever DM using abilities not on the character sheet or in the book, then it looks really cheap to have the DM do it.  I don't think the rules are broken or anything, nor is it "wrong", it just looks and feels cheap. Like seeing the strings on the X-Wing model.<br/><br/>Maybe we could come up with (on the Codex or another place) some story-ish ways to have a villain escape without cheeseballing the feel of the encounter.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149266/#Comment_149266" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T08:31:28+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  8:31AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simplicity itself...get yourself another villain.

Cause the DM is your friend, not your <b>BETRAYER</b> (said in ominous voice). Also, the villain presumably isn't the only thing in that encounter, there's a whole encounter wrapped around it. Usually in these situations, we see a villain show up, say a few lines, then slink off to another location. However, the DM might get blindsided because he didn't realize that he set the villain one square too far away from the nearest door, and Power X combines with player 2's feat Y and power Z means that the villain is pinned while they tear through the crowd and take him out.<br><br/>Which, yeah if I was the DM I'd totally laugh and say "Damn, you got 'im!" and perhaps do the second-in-command section.<br/><br/>If it was something where the DM kept having a villain jump in, tear us up, then poof away when we started lighting him up, well I'd take it.  If it happened again, I'd be like, "Look, either shit or get off the pot: Either the villain is here fighting us, or he's off somewhere else. Don't dangle the carrot in front of us and then pull it away when we reach for it".  But then again, I'd only expect to see that kind of thing at conventions with strangers and stuff.<br/><br/>But a "betrayal of trust"? Not sure I'd go as far as to say that. Unless I was seeing a psychiatrist who was for some reason DMing adventures for me in our sessions or something. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

If you can't reliably use the game mechanics to make creative inputs, then what are you doing at the table with those rulebooks? Vincent Baker mentioned something to the effect that the purpose of RPG game mechanics is to create outcomes that people don't want, and if you prefer a game based on outcomes that everyone wants, you might as well toss the rules that you weren't really using anyway and freeform it out.

Or if certain parts of the text were essentially written up back in 2005/6 while other parts were more recent.

That's why this isn't a fictional story.<br><br>This kind of construction just is not that hard to do (make the villain's initial spokesman both impressive and powerful--Darth Vader stood in for the Emperor, for example).

If someone gets killed, clearly they're not a reoccurring villain unless they do the pulp/superhero "back from the dead" thing.  But assigning status like that to story elements, independent from what the players want and what could potentially happen in play, seems like a bad idea.  Sure, set up a bunch of interesting foils, but make the "reoccurring villain" the one that actually reoccurs, after a handful of sessions, instead of choosing that beforehand.  Otherwise it's ass-backwards, in my opinion.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149303/#Comment_149303" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T10:55:00+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 10:55AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm actually kind of digging just how useful a knob action points are.

The other guy wanted me to ask, did you whip out your daily early or without much setup, or did you set it up so that you'd maxed out your bonuses and then used your daily as a finisher? <br/><br/>(I have no idea how many bonuses you can stack in prep for a daily. I didn't think it was that much, but he seemed to think it was an issue.) <br/><br/>Really, I'm thinking a house rule for APs may be "instead of taking a second attack, reroll the attack you just made." Of course, if the dailies suck enough that might not help, you very well could just miss twice in a row.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149314/#Comment_149314" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T11:41:54+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 11:41AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think AP-fueled compels and AP-fueling Keys could be a potentially potent combination.

I thought that was totally more of a Skills thing. In combat, with a +8 bonus, that's pretty much all I'd ask for in the case of my Warlord above: The problem I was facing is that there was just no way for me to pull in more bonuses to do the roll).  With a +8 (given that the others help), that wouldn't make it a given, but I'd be far more comfortable with that roll.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149344/#Comment_149344" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T12:13:38+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 12:13PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My preliminary thoughts on APs are that they should have skipped having Yet Another Thing to Track and just powered all the AP stuff with Healing Surges.  I mean calling it a "Surge" would make perfect sense to burn them for another action...at the expense of having them available for healing, that seems like a fun choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact...thinking out loud here...you could start with just 1 Healing Surge (like starting with 1 AP).  Then you earn one for every encounter you roll dice in (just like earning 1 AP for each milestone...only without the annoyance of having Yet Another Thing to Track).  You could also hand out surges like benies for things like cool skill checks, rewarding players who do the utility work instead of the flashy stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you could spend the surges for Healing (like a second wind) or additional actions, or a reroll, and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne key use for an AP/surge type point is what I call "Yeah, my cool idea works".  You know...those cool solutions that players come up with that "short circuit" an encounter and which DMs following the advice in the DMG would be inclined to find a way to prevent and hippie DMs would be inclined to just let them do.  By charging an AP for it, you still get the awesome...but you don't totally circumvent the resource management.  You can sometimes say "No" because they spent their APs on other stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149354/#Comment_149354" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T12:24:56+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 12:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, <br><br>Hmm.

For example, whenever a foe hits zero rather than narrating outcome (and presuming death or unconsciousness, which Player gets to choose) just say, "zero'd" and look to the Player to describe how it looks/what happened.<br/><br/>"promote a lesser villain" on page 98 is the answer to a villain's unexpected demise, not "let a villain escape".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149439/#Comment_149439" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T17:12:19+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  5:12PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I should write: "Just tell them the monster stats for the asking," somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149441/#Comment_149441" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T17:18:23+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  5:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe one surge for Encounters and two surges for Dailys if the economy needs it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149443/#Comment_149443" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T17:37:26+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  5:37PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2008 5:39PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>2) "Let the villain escape".

The DMG is appearing to remind me of one of my early girlfriends in college. Semi-schizoid and sometimes contradictory, but holy shit so goddamn hot you just want to explore it all over.<br/><br/>(Actually, thinking it further through, I won't take that metaphor to it's conclusion: Involving a messy breakup, pregnancy scare, it going totally psycho, and not being able to be near it for the next few years without getting physically ill)<br/><br/>In any case, even though the advice is sometimes contradictory, a lot of this stuff is gold.

I think the things that make me wary about it aren't the combat mechanics.  Those seem extremely well thought out.  Ralphs complaints about charge and combat advantage, for example, don't make sense to me, since the interaction of sneak-attack, shifting, and so on, lead to some really interesting tactical choices in play for relatively little complication.  I'm talking about things like Kobold being able to charge, shift as a move, then use their free shift to get behind someone, setting up their buddy for a sweet charge and flanking +3, or the Rogue not being able to sneak attack charging someone's face, but if they can get to someone's flank and charge, they get +3 and their sneak attack damage.  Sweet!  The way they've broken up actions makes a lot of sense to me too, allowing for the same kind of board-gamey tactical decisions, and letting a lot more happen between rounds and interrupting.  <br/><br/>What dissappointed me about the text was that there seems to be very little advance, and in fact a great deal of backsliding, in terms of how to actually use all this stuff to make an adventure.  I feel like 3rd ed. for all its faults, had a really cohesive set of rules.  Anything a character did in the setting was covered by a set of rules.  That creates its own problems, but it did mean that everything that happened in the game world was the result of interactions with the rules.  4e seems to me to be harking back to an older style of play, where a lot of actions outside (and inside) of combat are covered simply by Drama resolution between GM and players.  4e seems to have revived the concept of "roleplaying skill" in the gamist sense of using creative ability to think around challenges.  This manifests in really concrete ways (the explicit encouragement of puzzles and riddles in the DMG, and their inclusion in KotS) and more subtle ways (there are no skill rolls called for during the Winterhaven scenes, just roleplaying).  <br/><br/>Now maybe I'm just still burned by this style of play, and maybe it can be awesome in the right situation, but to me all it reminds me of is hours of wandering around the same freaking village looking for the "right" NPC to talk to, knocking up against some bullshit puzzle in the middle of a dungeon, or being punished for not thinking of the "obvious" solution to whatever problem the GM has cooked up.  In D&amp;D3, all of that stuff would be covered by a skill roll.

I'm not sure why the writer of Keep on the Shadowfell didn't choose to put any skill tests or skill challenges into the "in town" portions of the module... but he could have if he'd wanted to, and a DM running the module can certainly call for them, if the players do anything that he/she feels should be handled that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149641/#Comment_149641" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T10:00:09+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 10:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, I had the same problem you did when I ran KotS a few weeks ago. While the combat encounters were great, the adventure fell down in helping players find the next bit of fun. There were some bits of GM advice about "moving the story along" (the section of the book was even called something like that) that were somewhat railroady and the in-town parts of the adventure were organized poorly. They tried to help DMs by organizing the "investigation" part by topic -- each question that PCs might ask had its own section and under it were all the answers that different NPCs would give. In actual play, PCs tended to ask the same NPC a bunch of questions, and that made me jump around the book: I had to figure out who this NPC was, then jump to each question's section when they asked that. I'd rather have just had all the questions answered in each NPC's section. <br/><br/>Reorganizing the adventure wouldn't have made it less railroady, though. With very little effort, the KotS book could have dropped adventure opportunities in front of the PCs without the senseless role-play surrounding figuring out where to go next. <br/><br/>To get back on-thread, though, I think the DMG contains plenty of advice about this kind of stuff. It's not all perfect, as others have pointed out, but if the author of KotS had followed more of the DMG's advice, it would have benefited.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149649/#Comment_149649" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T10:30:05+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 10:30AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that I agree with that Adam.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we take as a given that the purpose of KotS is to 1) showcase what's new and different in 4E and 2) be runable "out of the box", I think the format and railroadyness of scenario are quite effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nExperienced roleplayers can roleplay if they want, but the scenario is there to get you to the next encounter so you can see a bit more of the new fighting rules in action.  Its the combat that's new, so its the combat that's featured.  4E didn't change how roleplaying works, so the scenario doesn't show case roleplaying stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat may well make it a "weaker" scenario.  But for what I think it was designed for I'm rather glad they put the talky stuff to the side so play can just get from one kill zone to the next with a minimum of interference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149652/#Comment_149652" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T10:40:48+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 10:40AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I admit, we totally handled the town in a tongue in cheek fashion, giving the NPCs quest icons a la World of Warcraft.
