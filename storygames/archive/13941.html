It's good to have some big nasty threats in mind that you can push on the group to give them something to work together against. You can also then finish up with a quick explanation of how campaign play would go based on that first session.<br/><br/>Be careful about the characters you include. Some don't suit a one-shot well. In my experience the Quarantine in particular doesn't work well, but having lots of violent characters is just fine. <br/><br/>I ran a convention game of Hatchet City one time, and that worked pretty well, but I think the first session approach is easier (for MC and players).<br/><br/>See also: <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=1265.0" rel="nofollow">AW forum thread about con games</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315873/#Comment_315873" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T10:47:38+00:00" title="March  8, 2011 10:47AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, do you take a break to write up fronts, or how do you do that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315876/#Comment_315876" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T11:04:11+00:00" title="March  8, 2011 11:04AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Per,<br/><br/>I've played Hatchet City, and I don't think it's well-suited to a one-shot. When I said so to Vincent, he agreed: it's not intended as a one-session game but rather as an example of what a session of Apocalypse World looks like in the middle of a campaign: a snapshot of an AW game in progress.<br/><br/>Hatchet City just has too much stuff going on in it; it's confusing for a focused scenario.<br/><br/>That kind of approach, though, is fantastic (the focused questions used to create the starting situation). I've used it in my Lady Blackbird hack, and I'm planning to do a similar thing for an Apocalypse World one-shot, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315880/#Comment_315880" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T11:25:50+00:00" title="March  8, 2011 11:25AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just run a first-session, as normal.

[Tosses the rest of the playbooks on the table, and slides them all toward Luke]<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The actual questions being asked don't matter. In fact, I've probably never asked those exact questions. What's key is: if you're only playing for one session, you want to get to the PC-NPC-PC triangles and unstable power dynamics as soon as possible. That means that you open with provocative, leading questions.<br/><br/>Those questions made a bunch of assumptions. In my experience, doing so has made for tighter one-shots of Apocalypse World. If you only have 3-4 hours to play, you want to have unstable power dynamics established within the first 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Also consider ignoring the Hx rules. I don't think they're important to one-shots, and they're time consuming. Instead, let players highlight a stat for the player on their right. Give everyone Hx+1 with everyone else. You lose something, but you also gain 5-10 minutes to determine whether Roark manages to take out Tum Tum's crew at the end of the session, which is more important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315932/#Comment_315932" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T15:26:39+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  3:26PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe's advice is good, I think.<br/><br/>John Harper had a thread about doing a "operator + crew" type setup, somewhat a la Firefly, which sounded like another good way to do it.<br/><br/>The problem with Hatchet City is a one-shot is a) there's just too much going on (I think there are, like, 22 NPCs in that scenario, and several geographic locations), and b) the characters could easily end up not interacting with each other. <br/><br/>When we played it, we kind of forced everything into a climactic battle at the end to make it all come together (as Michael describes it working when he played it).

A lot.</blockquote>\nYep, actually, I think when you ran this for us at Gencon the game went really similarly and was presented in a similar way. Except I'll add an addendum to what Joe said that I think you should definitely take the 5 mins to figure out the HX. It's so important to the game in my opinion, and if you're just getting a taste you want that sugar, baby. I mean, esp cause of the sex moves.<br/><br/>I just ran a one shot for my group last weekend, and did it like a "first session". But we made it a bit more elaborate. I did the set up the same as Harper and Mcdaldno, but after character creation we took a 10 min break, I asked someone to draw up a map of the town we were in, and I drew  a map of the surrounding area setting up 3 locations nearby that we could interact with in the first session (exactly like Harper did in our game at Gencon, thanks!). It was the hill people to the west, Rothchild's fortress north, riverpeople to the east. It works well, cause it gives people a direction if they want to interact with those 3 loose threats. Also, when we drew up the town, we created opportunities for NPCs and conflicts. It was a Hocus run scenario, and they totally wanted to jump into converting the riverpeople to their cult!<br/><br/>Also, one last tip. I kept notes. During that break I just wrote down scary things I thought would be weird to throw at them the first session that were indicative of the setting. Plague dogs. Androgynous river mutants with webbed fingers. Absinthe colored sky. Scary visions of a red tide (since we had a Hocus and a Brainer in play, I wanted a clear view of some scary visions of the psychic maelstrom). Then, when one of these things came up in play, I had a jumping off point to describe things.<br/><br/>I kinda just stuck with the basic advice in the book too. I asked a LOT of questions during the character creation of every player, so I could determine how people saw their PC, and what I could throw at them that would be fun conflict in that short amount of time. That level of transparency I think really got it going. We were so involved in that first session, even though it was a one shot we could easily jump into more. It ran a bit longer than a typical con game would, but I could've cut it shorter with the same results, and stuck to a stricter timeline.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316051/#Comment_316051" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T13:06:08+00:00" title="March  9, 2011  1:06PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, Kira, great point about the map and presenting opportunities.
