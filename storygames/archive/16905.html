I confess that I'm not the best with terminology, so if I get some of the terms wrong, please do correct me, but hopefully I can articulate what I mean to get across.  For the purposes of the discussion at hand, I'm thinking of games like D&amp;D; RuneQuest; Traveller; Big Eyes, Small Mouth; Stars Without Number; Tunnels and Trolls; and other such games, with a clear GM role and players in direct control of a single character in a simulated world.<br/><br/>I've seen a *lot* of pieces in this arena, and I'm working on one myself, but to me, the difference between a good, clear trad game and a murky one (a heartbreaker?) is one that I have trouble putting a finger on, except for that old definition of pornography, "I know it when I see it".  My primary goal is to avoid the pitfalls that make a game hard to play or facilitate.  So I thought I'd just put the question out there directly:<br/><br/><i>What are some qualities of a good traditional-style game, and what are some qualities of a bad trad game?</i>  And possibly, for bonus points, what are some qualities that don't make a difference one way or the other?  (One standout in that category to me is complexity; you can make a good complex game, and you can make a bad simple game.)  I'd also love if anyone could point me at any good discussions that have already been made about this topic.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385226/#Comment_385226" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T14:18:19+00:00" title="July 16, 2012  2:18PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2012 2:18PM by J_Walton.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, the relatively "traditional" games I've been digging lately are super short, like 4-10 pages, because -- since they draw on the participants' history of playing lots of similar RPGs -- they don't have to spend 100+ pages explaining how to play these types of games. They just give you the meat and let you go at it.  This also lets them boil down the things we love about these games into a super-concentrated stew that is very exciting and accessible. The thing that's currently blowing my mind is Michael Wight's <i>World of Warhammer</i> hack. SO GOOD!<br/><br/>I think this is a great model for "traditional" game design, especially if you're aiming primarily at an audience who already knows how to play these types of games. Or at least assume that the GM will know more-or-less what to do. There's still plenty of space to offer more specific instructions or tell the GM to focus on specific things, but you don't have to reinvent the wheel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385227/#Comment_385227" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T14:23:10+00:00" title="July 16, 2012  2:23PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2012 2:26PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim, by "good", do you mean "easy and fun to play and facilitate"?<br/><br/>It's been argued that the job of a good trad game is to inspire you and give you a box of tools, and <i>not</i> to tell you how to play.  If you are in that camp, "good" is very different than if you believe that a good game tells you how to play it, and you should be able to get good results simply from following instructions.

In the interest of clarity, "making the game I want to play", the piece I'm working on (a game intended to replicate the moment-to-moment feel of being a protagonist in an action movie or TV series) does have advice to the GM on scoping and flow, but doesn't have hard-wired mechanics that dictate the pace of the mission (I don't say, for example, "when you reach Heat Level 4, these guys come onto the scene").  I guess in that vein it's not dissimilar from some of the latter-day games Mr. Walton was referring to, in that there's a defined "mission" and way to scope it, a preferred form of mission planning in the style of Dungeon World and its ilk (impressions, setpieces, enemies, but not a predefined sequence of scenes), and rules for the action and interaction of characters, but no meta-level mechanics.<br/><br/>I won't be bold enough to say that tightly-focused games are "good" and toolbox games are "bad", or even "less good", but my personal preference is the latter of your two options, a game that does tell you how to play and should provide good results (at least more often than not), though I know that isn't everyone's cup of tea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385233/#Comment_385233" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T15:04:37+00:00" title="July 16, 2012  3:04PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2012 3:05PM by Captain_Thark.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [ignore]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385234/#Comment_385234" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T15:04:37+00:00" title="July 16, 2012  3:04PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2012 3:05PM by Captain_Thark.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, multipost...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid" title="SavageHominid"><img alt="SavageHominid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid">SavageHominid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385235/#Comment_385235" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T15:05:13+00:00" title="July 16, 2012  3:05PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A good trad game supports its setting and tone with mechanics (and reward/advancement), gives the GMs tools to express their artistic view of the setting, and also sets up clear expectations for play.<br/><br/>My idea of a trad game is, a GM represents the world and advocates for NPCs, while the players stay more-or-less to their characters, with few exceptions.

Mechanics that reinforce the setting have been a major focus of mine.  I'm trying to polish the mechanics of my action game to be simple and quick to resolve, while staying tightly-coupled to point-in-time actions of the players; the style of Tom Clancy, in particular, comes to mind.<br/><br/>Though I am intrigued by your remark about the "world outside" and its importance.  Do you think having the outside world be simulated to some degree is a necessary condition?  If so, is the "GM decides" route of logical deduction and assigning plot hooks okay (the way I usually run D&amp;D, and the style I intend for my piece -- eschewing details that don't matter to the players in the context of their mission), or do you prefer some level of metagame that determines that (for example, Stars Without Number's faction system)?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">@Captain_Thark</a>:  Neat, especially wrt games "making you fill dozens of [things]".  I confess have a soft spot for light mechanics, and smaller, more versatile options, though what I find most important is clarity.  There really should be no nonessential elements in a game's design and mechanics.  I'm pretty sure that's orthogonal to level of detail, since you can have a detailed game where all the moving parts come into play, or a simple, muddy game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385241/#Comment_385241" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T15:34:25+00:00" title="July 16, 2012  3:34PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, traditional RPGs are as much about what you do away from the table as what you do at the table.  There's a very strong element of "I'm going to make this thing and then I'm going to show it to you."  The GM would make this world and maybe this story and the players made characters.  Then, at the table, everyone got to show off the cool thing they made and then the rules said how the things that they made interact with one another, lubricated by the fiction.  The good traditional games gave you interesting processes for generating worlds/adventures/characters on your own and those processes were as fun to play with by yourself (like a mini-game) as the 'mechanisms' of the game were when you got together with others to game.  Additionally, they generated characters that were easy for everyone else to understand.  The bad ones, on the GM side, gave you a lot of setting information and told you to tell stories set in that world but didn't give you processes to go through.  The bad ones, on the players' side, gave you way more options than were interesting (too many flavors of +1) and generated characters that had so many nuanced details that they presented a wall of text that other players wouldn't appreciate, couldn't remember, and ultimately didn't play to.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385245/#Comment_385245" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T15:56:58+00:00" title="July 16, 2012  3:56PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim, thanks for the clarifications.<br/><br/>The first thing that comes to mind is the synergy between characters and missions.  What is the GM stoked about running, and what directions are the players stoked to send their characters in, and how do we make the two match up?  A good "tell you how to play" mission-based trad game oughta either do that work for you, or tell you how to do it yourselves in a pretty foolproof manner.<br/><br/>I'm thinking mainly of "this mission is tangible progress toward something the character cares about", but equally vital is "this mission involves activities the player enjoys".<br/><br/>I think the options roughly break down to:<br/><br/>Scenario First - GM makes a plan for the content of play, then gets players to make characters who will fit into that content.<br/><br/>Character First - Players make characters designed to work well together.  GM then designs scenarios based on those characters and how they work together.<br/><br/>Material First - Everyone gets on board with a setting, genre, references from other fiction, worldbook, canon, or any sort of inspiration that can be agreed upon.  GM and players then derive compatible characters and scenarios from this agreed-upon material.<br/><br/>Whichever path you want to take, <i>how easy the game makes it for the group to succeed</i> will be a make-or-break feature.  No one likes the trad game where the impassioned liberator of the underclasses gets shoehorned into corporate espionage missions, or where the tactical player spends all their time just roleplaying chats with NPCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385246/#Comment_385246" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T16:08:55+00:00" title="July 16, 2012  4:08PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I got this one!

A lot of the games I've seen where results vary widely from tepid to spectacular do a pretty poor job of facilitating any of the three approaches (D&amp;D 3rd edition, and the entirety of White Wolf's Old World of Darkness spring immediately to mind.)<br/><br/>The game I'm going for is pretty firmly in the camp of "Material First", though the specific directions its missions take blend somewhat into "Character First" -- a group with an engineer, medic, and stealth character should see very different action from a group with a gunner, sniper, and berserker, for example.

Or if multiple viable approaches exist.<br/><br/>- Is it a sandbox game where the PCs follow their inclinations and the GM "follows them around" (to quote AW)?<br/>- Is is a game where the PCs pursue formal agendas, creating new ones when the old ones are complete?<br/>- Is it a mission-based game where NPCs assign broad tasks and the PCs attempt them, at least at first?<br/>- Is it a game structured by the environment, like a dungeon-crawl, going room-by-room? Or a flowchart of scenes? <br/>- Is it an "illusionist" game where the GM plans a bunch of challenges for the PCs to overcome?<br/>- Is is some combination of the above or, crazier still, something completely different?<br/><br/>I've definitely sat in on some sessions where I assumed we were "playing to find out what happens" but, in fact, folks were playing mostly to experience being their character or find out what the GM had planned next. While I don't think GNS is really helpful here, "creative agendas" are clearly a thing and it's important to have a sense of what the game is about, even if it's determined by individual playgroups rather than the text of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385254/#Comment_385254" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T17:29:07+00:00" title="July 16, 2012  5:29PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><i>What are some qualities of a good traditional-style game, and what are some qualities of a bad trad game?</i>  And possibly, for bonus points, what are some qualities that don't make a difference one way or the other?  </blockquote>\nGood and bad are variable dependent mostly in the eye of the beholder especially when it comes to rules lite vs crunchy. Complexity can lead to nuance and players finding niches they enjoy, but it can also lead to confusion and frustration if it is not received well particularly by the GM. A GM that really "gets" a system can support players that don't get it at all even if the system is very crunchy. On the flip, even if the players are really into a setting, if the GM stumbles through it, they can destroy any story telling that the system was intended to do.<br/><br/>Lite systems are nice for broad brush strokes. Crunch is good for detailed illustration of the story. A great story can be told by either one lite systems depend on their color, crunchy systems depend on a fine eye and a steady hand (metaphorically). You can like either or both but few GMs are good at both.<br/><br/>One way to get a balance of both is to use a simple system 80% of the time to fill in large swaths of the background but then the focus becomes detailed. Because the mind's eye focuses on one thing, It assumes the rest of the setting is just as detailed as the focus. This is what a good game does.<br/><br/>A bad game assumes the reader knows what to do. This is where I differ with what was stated above. Don't assume. In general, as I've found, if a 9 year old can read your game and follow the instructions, you've done a good enough job with writing.<br/><br/>A more squishy concept is, does the game inspire? That depends on the reader to an extent. I'm totally not interested in zombie games. You put one in front of me and I'm not interested. So you can't please everyone. But you can make a game uninspiring by not explaining the core conflicts clearly enough. Players (including the GM) should instantly know what their job will be when playing the game. Even if they get to choose that job each time they play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385274/#Comment_385274" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-17T01:27:49+00:00" title="July 17, 2012  1:27AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>a group with an engineer, medic, and stealth character should see very different action from a group with a gunner, sniper, and berserker, for example.</blockquote>\nI've yet to see a really good set of trad-game tools for helping the GM turn "what players want" info into good scenarios.

If the group already has a good sense of what play will be about, then this discussion is mostly just double-checking and troubleshooting.  If the group is still fuzzy on what they'll be doing, though, this can make a huge difference -- maybe the medic-player wants death's door drama, or diagnostic puzzles, or just to be an empathic foil to the party's tough guys.

They're one or two word descriptors of things they're interested in. It's up to the GM to interpret how they fit together normally but it would be fine for the players to piece them together but there's less surprise that way. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to do that before each game?

It *sounds* like you aren't, with your discussion of the moment-to-moment feel, but I just want to make sure. Because military adventure fiction has certain beats that you can only get in an RPG, IME, with scene-level mechanics and explicit player buy-in into those mechanics. Otherwise, you're going to have some times where the players outsmart you and kill the bad guy in the first 15 minutes, and other times where the PCs get slaughtered in the first 15 minutes. And while such outcomes may be moment-to-moment convincing (I'm not going to say "realistic," but they can definitely be made plausible to the group), that's not exactly palatable most of the time.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimD" title="JimD"><img alt="JimD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimD">JimD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385532/#Comment_385532" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-21T13:49:21+00:00" title="July 21, 2012  1:49PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a>:  You make a good point there.  To be honest, this thread kind of diverted from "What makes a good trad game" to "Hey, let's discuss my personal project!" -- the nutshell version of the message I'm getting from my original question is kind of "eye of the beholder".  Of course, the question I asked wasn't really the question I meant; if Story Games is good for anything, it seems to be figuring out the OP's original intent and sparking excellent discussion.  As a consequence of the way I framed the original question, I didn't want to wax poetic about the entire structure of my piece.<br/><br/>But since you ask, I am putting thought into mission flow and ramp-up; fight the weenies first, explore the space (since action follows the heroes), figure out the real problem, get to the baddie's lair, and mess his day up.  The "mission planning" I intend is pretty sparse, *somewhat* in the vein of Dungeon World and its related games; figure out the first scene, figure out the baddie's lair (the final scene), and then lay out enemies, impressions, and a handful of explosive setpieces, with no sequential order to anything.  More or less, the GM follows the players' action, dropping the pieces he has in his toolbelt in the players' way where it makes sense.  Again, I'm weak with terminology, so forgive me if I step on the toes of any definitions here, but it's kind of "illusionist" in that way; the players will get to the Big Bad when it makes sense to the flow of the action.<br/><br/>Oh, and the players don't die.  If someone wipes out, the enemies simply don't kill him; they capture him.  If he ends up in a nuclear explosion, however unlikely, the PC will survive and find himself in big trouble.  And if the entire team is defeated, they're captured or left for dead, and end up at a pretty serious disadvantage.  By rule, the mission never fails unless time runs out, or the PCs are wiped in the final scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385535/#Comment_385535" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-21T14:26:01+00:00" title="July 21, 2012  2:26PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2012 2:26PM by Deliverator.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Again, I'm weak with terminology, so forgive me if I step on the toes of any definitions here, but it's kind of "illusionist" in that way; the players will get to the Big Bad when it makes sense to the flow of the action.</blockquote>\nDoesn't sound like Illusionism to me... but I'd have to see it in play to know for sure.

By rule, the mission never fails unless time runs out, or the PCs are wiped in the final scene.</blockquote>\nDo the <i>players</i> know this going in?<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimD" title="JimD"><img alt="JimD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimD">JimD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385538/#Comment_385538" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-21T15:06:53+00:00" title="July 21, 2012  3:06PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2012 3:07PM by JimD.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What do you do if the PCs genuinely and legitimately figure out a way to make the BB go splat right quick?</blockquote>\nGood for them, right?  I've seen stories where the antagonist bites it in Act I, and the rest of the story is how the protagonists get away with their skins.  So the Final Scene happens early, and we can reshuffle the rest of the action.  Perhaps the players' helicopter (or vehicle, or whatever) gets sabotaged, and they have to figure out how to escape the mission zone.  Take the puzzle pieces and put them *after* the boss instead of before.  I mean, I'm not naive enough to think that'll work perfectly every time, but it seems sound enough to me.\n<blockquote>Do the <i>players</i> know this going in?</blockquote>\nYes.  A principle of the game is "decisionmaking is an open book".  I don't have any knowledge or rules in the game's rulebook that the GM knows, and the players shouldn't.  Short of the exact challenges in the mission plan, the players are complicit.  I also make clear that anyone at the table can call bullshit if something the GM (or another player) does doesn't make sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385539/#Comment_385539" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-21T15:46:06+00:00" title="July 21, 2012  3:46PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This whole thread is fatally flawed because "trad games" is such a huge subject.
