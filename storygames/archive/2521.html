I'm working on a con game of The Shadow of Yesterday. Here's the pitch I posted on the con sign-up page:<br/><br/>As Knights of New Empire, it is your job to tour the borders of New Empire, collecting taxes and pledges of fealty. Everything is going according to protocol, until you reach the home of the mud people. The mud people refuse to answer your demands. Worse, they refuse to let you leave. They have secrets that are worth killing to protect. The Earth Trembles in an Uncharted Language is a scenario of dark fantasy and horror, pitting the Knights of New Empire against their deepest, darkest fears. The game is run on Clinton R. Nixon's The Shadow of Yesterday system, and is open to beginners.<br/><br/>So, the idea is dark fantasy/horror. I want it to be highly environmental, and a lot of energy will go into describing (hopefully) evocative landscape and mood.<br/><br/>Here's the basic deal for the mud people:<br/>A tribal society, fairly low-tech. They live over the fertile-yet-hazardous T'zeka Bogs. The Bogs are shifting landscapes of mud, thick woods, and water. The bogs rest on a fault (or something), and are prone to minor earthquakes and such (I'm going to do some wikipedia-ing in the upcoming days to figure out how this somewhat-logically happens, but the basic idea is that their construction is often wrecked due to weather and earthquake and such).<br/><br/>The Mud People grow fairly transient crops (by this, I mean crops that can be replanted at any point during their growth) in the bog waters. They also hunt bogbeasts and mudfish in the wooded areas. The area is almost entirely deep mud and water, so they build their homes on stilts and between tree trunks, connecting them with bridges and plank walkways (made of a mixture of straw, wood slats, wood planks, and fallen tree trunks).<br/><br/>The walkways and bridges are built by the village Pathmakers, an esteemed "class" of men and boys who have learned the art of felling trees, constructing bridges, and navigation. Since the weather and earthquakes are constantly wrecking the small walkways between homes and extensive walkway networks between cities, Pathmakers have a full-time job.<br/><br/>Here's the more specific deal for the con scenario:<br/>There is a single village that has been ravaged of late by an unknown, lurking evil (insert CoC vibe here). The mud has risen in unheard of ways, destroying homes and drowning villagers. Pathmakers can no longer keep up to the building demands, and trade routes are temporarily lost. Monsters are on the prowl. Someone in the village has invited this sorcerous devastation in on them.<br/><br/>The Village Chieftan has begun actively recruiting Warriors, indoctrinating them into a rigorous and zealous training program. The Chieftan begrudges the Elders, but has no open confrontation with them. The Warriors develop animosity with the Pathmakers, as if vying for social status as the "new elite". Everyone is wary of the Chieftan, but he might ultimately be their only hope for salvation.<br/><br/>Here's the deal with the knights:<br/>Before New Empire, there were a whole lotta fragmented kingdoms at war. When the new Emperor took control of the large continent, he united nations and made life better for a whole lotta people. Most of the knightly orders that were at war become superfluous at that point. Some disbanded, some became Empire Knights, but some (including the PCs of this game) became tax collectors. That's right, tax collectors (insert grumbling and disgruntled knights here).<br/><br/>The knights have arrived at the Mud People home to collect monies and goods (the Mud People have a lot of trade routes going through their land, as they are the only land bridge between New Empire and some other big province on the other side). When they get there, to this village, a huge storm knocks out the village walkways and drowns their horses. They are forced to stay longer, and by the time they would leave they already know too much of the dark secrets that this village possesses.<br/><br/>What I'm planning to do with this con game:<br/>The PCs are the tax collecting knights.<br/>They arrive, they have a banquet in their honour, they start to realize the local hostilities.<br/>The storms happen, they witness out-of-the-corner-of-your-eye type horrors.<br/><br/>The game could go in many directions from there, but the ones I'm fairly prepared for are:<br/>-The Chieftan is a horrible sorcerer, and has summoned both the storms and the monsters in order to gain more power.<br/>-Same as above, but if they develop a sympathetic understanding of the Chieftan, I add "..but I never meant for it to go this far!"<br/>-The Chieftan and his warriors must be overthrown!<br/>-The Chieftan must be overthrown, but the warriors must be turned over to your side first!<br/>-The Chieftan and his warriors are the only hopes for saving this village, but for some reason they are afraid to act.<br/>-The Warriors have been ordered to spare the monsters, and you eventually realize that the monsters are the lost villagers!<br/>-The monsters are a supernatural mystery to be investigated.<br/>-The Elders know the secret, but for some reason they won't talk. Maybe they hate the Chieftan, and this is their doing.<br/>-The Children must be saved from this doomed village! Somehow, you must smuggle the children out of here.<br/>-Maybe the Mud People deserve to be killed.<br/><br/>I'm trying to make it an occult-y game where the ending, the "big evil", is flexible and plays to the players' actions. I'm going to be upfront about this fact at the start of the game. I will tell them "I have some ideas about what's really going on here, but ultimately it's just going to play out. If you guys push for a certain ending, I'm going to back you up. I have a beginning and a middle, and the end is totally flexible."<br/><br/>Now... I want a few things here:<br/>1.) Are there additions to the Mud People, or suggestions for them, that would make for a cooler backdrop and village?<br/>2.) Any ideas for cool new Keys and Secrets that I could create? (I'm working on a set of Keys that will embrace the Dark Fantasy thing better.)<br/>3.) Any suggestions for how to play out the monsters?<br/>4.) Cool PC suggestions? (note: all PCs will be human tax collector knights)<br/>5.) Awesomification of this basic premise?<br/>6.)Suggestions for other endings?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58130/#Comment_58130" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T16:20:22+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  4:20PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your game will be constructed by constructing cool Keys.<br/><br/>Where's Thor?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58137/#Comment_58137" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T16:31:46+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  4:31PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Judd. Thanks.<br/><br/>I'm working on the Keys for this game right now, and am kinda struggling on some parts. One or two of the knights will have religiously-flavored Keys, and that'll put them in a lot of Dogs-esque chest-puffing situations. One of the knights will have a Key of curiosity/inquisition, and will likely end up over his head as a result. I'm thinking about a Key of the Civilized, for a disdainful and sneering knight.<br/><br/>I'm considering making the PCs be more than just the knights. Make one the Chieftan, one the Village Idiot, two or three Knights, and a Pathmaker. But the audience that signed up is largely trad-situated, and I'm worried that such a set-up might be awkward or hit a grinding halt. I also think this won't hit all my buttons, because I am going to be honest... I want to have a larger control on the story than that. I'm not talking about railroading, I just want a central role for this game (I am running other games where the GM acts as more of a facilitator and less of a provider, so I want some balance).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58140/#Comment_58140" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T16:38:20+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  4:38PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>I also think this won't hit all my buttons, because I am going to be honest...

Guardian and Doom is a good pair.  <br/><br/>In my <a href="http://www.rpglaboratory.com/tsoy_stuff" rel="nofollow">Aztec</a> one the PCs are out to kill three Gods, so I made sure that one PC desperately wants to save each one (Love, The Mission, etc), and one wants to kill each one.  Characters all have a personal relationship that is problematic with at least one other PC (Guardian, Vengeance, etc).  If you use this technique not only do the characters write themselves, but the situation is self-guided.  You can basically sit back and watch it explode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58144/#Comment_58144" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T16:47:33+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  4:47PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2007 4:48PM by Mcdaldno.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (x-posted with the Morningstar)<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure what I mean by that statement either, but:<br/><br/>I think that the audience I am playing to is one which expects a fair amount of "prepared story", especially for a con game. Over half of the con slots are Living Greyhawk and Living Eberron games, to give you a fairly clear idea of what I mean by this.<br/><br/>I want to provide a game that DOESN'T railroad, but also doesn't leave them hanging on that expectation of being injected into a story-in-motion. I feel like if I said "Okay, you are all opposing sides in this conflict, and this is what you are keeping from one another" or some varient, that they'd be unsure what to do, save killing each other. The whole village hostility thing would likely be lost, unless it was ALL hardwired into the Keys. Ultimately, I don't think the players would know how to react, and there'd be a lot of stumbling at first.<br/><br/>So, that's part of what I mean. The other part is this: I really want to provide that story-in-motion that the players are injected into. I want to paint the picture of what this village is like and what kind of treachery is going on here underneath the surface. I want to take on the roles of the important villagers.<br/><br/>I feel that if I made the characters: Chieftan, Elder, Child, Pathmaker, Knight, Knight Captain... that I'd be cutting myself out of a lot of the things which I'm looking for as a GM for this game, and I'd also potentially cause the players to trip up hard when they realized that they were their own adversity.<br/><br/>Does that make a bit more sense, Judd?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58172/#Comment_58172" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T20:48:05+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  8:48PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2007 8:50PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Throw in a little Heart of Darkness. Key of 'Going Native.' At least one PC should be in love/lust with a mud person. I would start the session after the flood, possibly even after the knights have been there for a day or two. This makes it easier to add in relationships between PC knights and the villagers, perhaps. It also lets you put 'you have seen this creepy/weird thing' blurbs on everyone's character sheet, which allows you to build on that when you start the actual horror-narration instead of starting from scratch.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in some previous conversation, I feel like Kafka is better than CoC for inspiration. There may be some problem at the village, but it is not recent or unexpected -- it's always been like this. There have always been killings/sacrifices/whatever. There are always flash floods. Every year the Chief raises warriors and they slaughter the Pathmakers. Babies always disappear. Everyone accepts it -- they are mysteriously resigned to it. Will the knights share their resignation?<br/><br/>The mud is the monster. The environment. Only foolish knights would pretend there was some 'dragon' to be slain, some problem to be solved. The more you struggle the deeper you get.<br/><br/>Their lost horses should reappear in surreal situations. Made out of mud. In dreams. Drowning. Promising escape.<br/><br/>They should have secret orders from the Empire. Kill the Chieftain. Overthrow the Elders. These orders should conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58176/#Comment_58176" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T21:42:00+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  9:42PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My gaming instinct tells me that if they don't have conflicting Keys, it's probably not worth using TSOY.  You can underscore this by giving them Secrets that back up their Keys.  <br/><br/>One idea: you've already got a kind of containment going on by having a limited number of pathways through a trackless bog and having an evil force that's haunting the bog and destroying pathways.  You can play up the paranoia of being stuck in this weird environment with monsters outside and untrustworthy natives inside.  Rather than having a series of possible outcomes, perhaps it would be helpful to a have a whole series of weird and stressful events to throw at the characters -- Bangs, pretty much.  Since you're working with pregen characters, you'll be able to do this in advance.  Add in some freaky horror stuff, and you're probably good to go.  <br/><br/>Ice Cream Emperor's ideas are pretty cool, too. If you're not going to have anyone playing a native, you can leave it wide open whether the weirdness in the mud is a problem for the natives, or is a reaction to the soldiers coming into the bogs, or something else.  Watching Apocalypse Now and taking notes can't hurt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58180/#Comment_58180" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T23:49:17+00:00" title="February 27, 2007 11:49PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Keys don't have to be conflict, necessarily.

I think I disagree considering your format and audience, though.  If you want to start in medias res and guide the players to the good stuff in TSOY in a couple of hours, point them straight at each other.  That's my feeling, anyway.  <br/><br/>Another convention play note, Joe - give everyone an index card with a bunch of suggestions for advancement on it.  Put logical pool increases, a couple of abilities the player would be likely to want upped, an appropriate secret and a juicy key.  They can still scour the book for cool stuff as well, but having some simple, obvious choices at hand is really useful.
