The A.N.I.Ma turns intimate relationships, which can be either love or hatred, into weapons and armor against the alien threat. But beware... these weapons are only as tough as your trust in those relationships, trust that can be shattered by alien attack.<br/><br/>GM's will need a copy of Bliss Stage to play, available at Indie Press Revolution as the Interim Stage pdf. x Then, look at community.livejournal.com/bay_bliss_stage for the submission guidelines for Authority Figures, Pilots, Anchors and other characters.<br/><br/>The Telegraph by West MacArthur Resistance is 5 Pilots and 5 Anchors strong - but will it be enough to defeat these alien nightmares? Join the Bay Area Resistance and rep your part of the bay, and we can drive off this menace for good... and have a lot of fun telling powerful stories while we're at it!<br/><br/>I hope to see you there.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141426/#Comment_141426" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-27T11:36:11+00:00" title="April 27, 2008 11:36AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, hang on, let me make sure that I'm understanding this.
