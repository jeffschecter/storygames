Thanks to the lack of AC in my current residence and the extreme heat, we relocated and played at a back booth in a local bar, which, it turned out, was showing the Ultimate Fighting World Championship on a 90" screen.  Occasionally the game was interrupted by the shouts of a large crowd watching someone getting their face pounded in.  Kind of an incredible backdrop, really, which made up for not getting to use the soundtrack I had assembled.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the premise of the game is the standard setting for Lacuna, with the small twist that the characters are total amnesiacs in residence at the Orphic Institute.   The characters have been recruited for the Lacuna Project, under the pretense that it will help them in their recovery.  The subtext is that they have themselves been subject to the Lacuna treatment at some point in the past, and lost their memories as a result.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first session was a pretty vanilla game, just get in, find the Hostile Personality, and bag it, with a liberal amount of wandering the city and getting very annoyed with Control's unhelpful attitude.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis second session the characters went to a psychic's apartment, where they met a funny character from the first session, apparently a higher-up in Blue city's mafia.  This character initiated the Penny for my Thoughts treatment, and recovered one memory each (concerning their everyday life before the incident which led to their amnesia), without the knowledge of Control.  ("You might wonder how it is that drinking an imaginary substance while in a dream state would have any effect on your ability to recall your past life...  But let us not argue with results!")  Afterwards, they continued looking for the Hostile Personality, who was apprehended and neutralized at the Cathedral of the Logicians, on Central Square.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game went fantastically well; I made some custom handouts for the 'Penny' procedure, keeping the existence of that game under-the-hood.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
