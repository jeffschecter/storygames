MONSTER! DEAL. NOW!!<br/><br/>While a proactive investigator is a possible way to roll, the clueless rube is part of the very set-up of the game. Because: horror. Most horror movies presuppose a nonprofessional nonmonster hunter who has to deal with the supernatural because otherwise they or the world are doomed otherwise. The Lovecraft source material very much included.<br/><br/>I don't understand how introducing nonmonster hunters ot monsters could foul up the game--that<i>is</i>the game.<br/><br/>...and how you do that without railroading:<br/><a href="http://www.dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2012/02/hunterhunted.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2012/02/hunterhunted.html</a><br/></blockquote>\nWell, yes. There are solutions. The main difficulty with Cthulhu is that it's a very wide-open game. I think that anybody would agree that it's a wide-open tool-set, for the most part. Heck, take your average CoC text (any edition, they're near identical), and it's going to be 20% tools for creating all sorts of characters, 20% discussion about all the possible ways of running a horror game, 30% monster listings and the rest some ready-made adventure scenarios. That's not much in the way of focus. What gives the game its profile is the Lovecraftian color, but that's just color: there is nothing particular in the structure of the game to make it "Lovecraftian", nor does it really try to even define what that would mean aside from having player characters go crazy now and then. I have identified at least four self-consistent but mutually incompatible ways of playing "Call of Cthulhu", all with some degree of textual support.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that it's insurmountable to play the game in a fun way. I just personally happen to have had a long history of lukewarm sessions that have left me very aware of the game's weaknesses as a game text. Hit upon a functional and fun way to play, and you'll never have the same problems.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the game text is very much against your suggested solutions. Not that this makes those solutions wrong for CoC - it's very clear to me that it's a toolbox game, you do what works. But if you look at the actual text we were working with while learning the game, proactive GMing like "monsters jump out" or "the supernatural is going to get you whether you want it or not" were definitely, specifically not in the repertoire: old man Corbit in "The Haunted House" ("The Haunting", as this probably most well-known CoC scenario is also known by) is not going to jump out, and he's definitely not going to escalate beyond the types of tactics established in the module text. Or maybe he is, or should be, but reading the text you don't get this impression, the way it carefully delineates the things that <i>can</i> happen. Corbit also doesn't have any in-character motivation for going on a rampage, so I'd say that this quintessential CoC scenario is a very good example of how the game can go if you play ineffectively: a random bunch of characters sort of messing about with detective work, a monstrous backstory that never gets unearthed, and a monster climax that might happen or not, but probably won't happen with any sort of satisfactory pacing.<br/><br/>(For those wondering about the play experience the CoC game text teaches, I note that Chaosium is giving "The Haunting" away for free as part of <a href="http://www.chaosium.com/forms/coc_quick_start_color.pdf" rel="nofollow">an introductory pdf</a>. Definitely nostalgic, I remember running this in my teens. The book bound in human flesh was something that I very much desired to show to the other players as a climax of sorts. I don't think us teenagers were at all equipped to unravel the actual system of clues and backstory, of course. Certainly when I GMed this for a fresh bunch two years ago we didn't fare any better - a dull session of mostly barking at the wrong trees, and the players never even thought to look in the cellar.)<br/><br/>And again, because for some reason our discussions resemble arguments more than discussions, so maybe I need to be extra-clear about my point: I'm not saying that the game is bad or doesn't work. I'm just saying that CoC's been a difficult game for me historically, and I think that there are recognizable reasons for that in the game's text. Nowadays, as I grow stronger and stronger in my roleplaying, I am positively brimming with ideas for what to do with the basic premise of CoC. One of these days I'll no doubt get it right (perhaps in multiple different ways), but I don't think I can attribute much more than the core inspiration to that game text I got in '92. An inspiring text, but not particularly effective for us in reaching a functional set of play procedures.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366479/#Comment_366479" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T19:10:25+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  7:10PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, ok.<br/><br/>I mean, I guess you just assume the gamebook is gonna (or should(?)) give you way more guidance than I do.<br/><br/>A "wide-open" game is the <i>opposite</i> of a problem so far as I'm concerned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Figaro" title="Figaro"><img alt="Figaro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Figaro">Figaro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366480/#Comment_366480" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T19:51:43+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  7:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Eero<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it's worth noting that The Haunting/The Haunted House is basically an entirely location-based adventure and so doesn't really <i>call for</i> the "hunter/hunted" structural overlay that Zak identified above.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Zak S&lt;/cite&gt;A "wide-open" game is the&lt;i&gt;opposite&lt;/i&gt;of a problem so far as I'm concerned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI concur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366481/#Comment_366481" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T19:57:18+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  7:57PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of what makes CoC "easy" is that the whole premise is RIGHT THERE. When I ran it back in the day, it always went wonderfully because I and my players all had an intuitive grasp of how the game is supposed to work. It's a very simple formula. The one time CoC ever failed me I was playing a written module exactly as written. The module just told you to do stuff, so I skipped all the intuitive horror bits that I'd been doing all along. The adventure fell flat. I've never read the Corbit scenario, but that may be where the problem comes in. It seems to tell you more about how to run the game, but in this case you end up with less because, thinking you've got a clear set of instructions, you stop doing the stuff you need to do.<br><br>The thing with CoC though is that if you don't have the intuitions, it can just collapse. As an aside, some of the collapse states are pretty interesting games in themselves. I know CoC players who've had a blast hunting Shoggoths with rocket launcher or crashing aircraft carriers into Cthulu. Good clean fun.<br><br>Graham Walmsley's "Stealing Cthulu" is a really great book to look at. The focus of the entire book is on transmitting the feeling of Lovecraftian investigative horror. Once you've read through it you'll be so brimming with Cthulu-esque awesomeness you won't be able to wait to play, and you'll know exactly what to do. Oh, the game also has a page of rules at the end. They are basically all you need to run CoC.<br><br>Reading Graham's book made me understand what I was already doing intuitively when I ran Cthulu, so in that sense it was very useful. I'd probably use his game to run it again, just because it's so spectacularly rules light that I can pull it out any time and start running it. Old-school CoC is great, too.<br/><br/>One other important bit that I never realized myself, but that Graham talks about very well, is the difference between PCs and Lovecraft protagonists. The protagonists in Lovecraft don't really investigate. For the most part they mystery is spoon fed to them until they hit the big horrible reveal at the end. PCs are not so accommodating. It's not a huge deal, but I think it throws people off sometimes when they're focusing on making the game look as much like a Lovecraft story as possible.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366491/#Comment_366491" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T21:55:52+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  9:55PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2012 10:08PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Probability simulation task resolution mechanics + immersive character play + mysterious threats + investigation opportunities = "How am I going to solve this problem?"<br/><br/>I'm there, in character, there's a problem that threatens me and/or the world, and look, the skills on my character sheet are a toolkit for tackling that.<br/><br/>This is why, when people play Cthulhu wrong, I'm not inclined to lay the blame solely on them.  <br/><br/>Yeah, the flavor text in the book tells you to focus on atmosphere and horror and discovery.

In practice a huge portion of the entertainment is each of these people trying to deal with each other. "The horror!" chair tends to rotate. The game periodically INSTRUCTS someone go into freakout mode due to blown SAN.

If by "fair shot" you mean "the odds of your success are likely," or "if you are careful, success is certain," then no. But the game does not promise these things either. Generally you have a <i>fair shot</i> in the sense that the scenario has a certain set-up and the Keeper responds fairly to player action, doesn't reshuffle the situation to enforce failure, etc. I.E. the game is hard and favors the opposition, but is not <i>rigged.</i> so in that sense is a "fair shot."<br/><br/>I think that to an extent CoC as written <i>is</i> a strategic exercise. But it is one in which there are horror-specific complications, and that it is openly a difficult strategic exercise. Note the example of play, where it's a clusterfuck and they die.

That all makes sense to me intellectually, but absolutely does not jibe with my experience.  <br/><br/>By "fair shot" I meant that there is a knowable link between player performance and success.  That is, I know that coming up with a clever way to approach the cult will help, and when I do it, it does.  As opposed to the GM not having the improv chops to get from "Dave's weird improvised solution" to "a place where I am confident I can continue to GM a fun game", and thus saying either "that doesn't work" or "it works, but it doesn't wind up mattering."  And suppose the GM and I simply disagree on what's a clever way to approach the cult, purely as a matter of personal opinion?<br/><br/>This is a potential issue in more games than I can name, but CoC is one of the worst cases I've seen in practice.  I suspect that the culprits are (a) withholding info, (b) lethality, (c) mechanics that model some of reality but with gaps, and (d) mechanics that model reality poorly.  So you wind up with paranoid, cautious, slow, hesitant, blind attempts with implausible odds.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Figaro</cite>The problem of dealing with a freaked out comrade is part of the overall "how do we deal with the profane conspiracy" process.</blockquote>Oh, hell yeah, that's great!  I wasn't talking about the problem-solving player who loses too much Sanity, though.  I was talking about the player who is <i>not there to problem-solve at all</i>; he's there to see weird shit and go "Oh gods no!" even when the mechanics don't tell him to, because that's what Lovecraft protagonists do.  This player has no patience for endless debates on how many shots the crazy cultists will get at us as we sprint across the field versus the feasibility of attaching a grappling hook to a statue.  This player just wants to keep the fiction moving and see more cool horror stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366506/#Comment_366506" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T00:16:59+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 12:16AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2012 1:01AM by komradebob.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Call of Cthulhu is not a difficult game.<br/><br/>It is Moldvay era Basic D&amp;D, set in the 1920s, with a mystery's network of clues replacing a physical dungeon's series of rooms. The GM is either allowed to use 1/2 to 2 HD monsters or 8+HD monsters, but if he uses 8+ HD monsters, he has to provide tips and tricks among the clue matrix to defeating those 8+ HD monsters by means other than physical confrontation.<br/><br/>PCs have two kinds of hit points: Regular old hit points and mental hit points, which can have critical table type effects, but don't kill the character directly. You start out with a whole lot of the second kind, but the critical hits mostly invovle stuff like running away or otherwise being useless. Sometimes the clues that you discover to help you defeat the 8+ HD monsters whittle away at those second kind of hit points and make later criticals easier to suffer, so watch out! it's a trade off.<br/><br/>There are only humans as PCs, but there is magic. Magic isn't the flashy kind, but it is the big and powerful kind, and mostly for PCs is related to defeating the 8+ HD monsters. PCs that can end up using magic usually lose a lot of those Mental Hit Points learning to use those more powerful spells. Those spells they do learn often take time to get cooking, so they'll need pals that are the equivalents of fighters and thieves in the 1920s to protect them while they go about their business.<br/><br/>The other guys don't get much in the way of armor (watch out, you'll bekinda squishy) or magic swords or pretty pony warhorses, but they do get stuff like tommyguns, and nickleplated twin .45 automatics and fast cars and autogyros, so really, who cares? Mowing down a horde of gibbering 1/2 HD monsters is awesome.<br/><br/>The PCs are heroes, but nobody around them much believe in monsters except them and the poor devils that encounter them, and usually those folks are the hooks for an adventure. The PCs don't get rich like in D&amp;D ( sometimes they start pretty much rich!!!), but they do get to risk their necks doing terribly heroic stuff like saving  a family, or town, or even the whole planet from those nasty big critters and their minions.

My own gaming has improved tremendously with the post-millenial game texts that have been written more with the multitude of subcultures in mind. I don't mind the loss of theoretical freedom, as I have plenty of freedom in choosing which game texts to use and how to use them. There are a thousand ways to be wrong for every way of being right, so I see a clear game text as a useful guide in the wilderness of all non-fun ways to play. Of course this isn't going to be that compelling for somebody who already has hit upon functional play by themselves or thanks to some formative texts or smart tutoring or whatever; I can totally see how a gamer like that would be less interested in the definitiveness of a text and more interested in whether it is inspirational or not.<br/><br/>CoC is a good example here, because we can contrast it with later games with different relation between the game text and the game group. Games like <i>Dread</i>, <i>Dead of Night</i> and <i>Dread: First Book of Pandemonium</i> (no relation, believe it or not) traverse a part of the same ground CoC does, but do so with more concrete procedures and a more exact vision of what is going to happen at the gaming table. None of these games really embraces the entirety of what CoC purports to be, but I find that they're dependable at doing whatever subset of horror each attempts.<br/><br/>In this regard I find the type of writing that e.g. Graham Walmsley does on Cthulhu to be extremely appropriate and compelling for our times: we need more interpretative and instructive writing on roleplaying, especially regarding the classical games that provide plenty of opportunity and depth, that have a valiant history and immense potential, but that are also difficult and ambivalent. I see much of OSR writing in this same light, and can only applaud it: write me your instruction manuals, I'll be perfectly capable of synthesizing them with the original texts and utilizing the resulting well-defined game to have fun with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366515/#Comment_366515" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T05:05:25+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  5:05AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>The Call of Cthulhu system isn't explained in the text.

The true game (in the sense of the most compelling and functional) lives in the oral culture. It is often, of course, much easier to play well than write what you're doing well, which explains why this is the way things are. Also, many people have told me that many "old school" game texts are intentionally badly written because the ideal of game writing in that culture was to not write a game, but rather just a bunch of disparate tools that might or might not be used by the GM. Perhaps this is the case, although the idea superficially smacks of a posteori justification.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366534/#Comment_366534" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T08:15:23+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  8:15AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>It is Moldvay era Basic D&amp;D, set in the 1920s, with a mystery's network of clues replacing a physical dungeon's series of rooms.</blockquote>\nThis makes me want to cry.

In my experience, there hasn't been a strong oral culture - though of course there might be strong oral cultures in other regions.  For me, different groups all went in different directions from the basis in Lovecraft and the written adventures and sourcebooks.  <br/><br/>In contrast, I felt that in my Dead of Night games, the mechanics for resolution were more clear and explicit, but the larger structure of the adventure and how to play weren't as clear as in Call of Cthulhu.  Dead of Night didn't have as specific a source material, and the sample adventures were more varied and had fewer specifics than the classic Cthulhu adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366558/#Comment_366558" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T11:13:28+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 11:13AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Figaro</cite>It depends on what you mean by "a fair shot."

I think it was no fun because the detective didn't really appreciate the distraction from mystery-pursuit, and the freak-out player didn't really appreciate the laborious thinking through problems.  It sounds to me like you're talking about a situation in which everyone at the table is really adept at not only pursuing what they want, but also at recognizing the different things that other people want, and being fully supportive of them in those ends.  On the one hand, I agree that this is a fantastic way to play RPGs.  On the other hand, it sounds like an extremely tall order.  If you have any tips for pulling that off besides "play with awesome people", I'd love to hear 'em.  I usually help groups play well together by communicating about the shared aspect of play, and getting folks to unite around that.

You face challenges and try to avoid violent death, but in CoC the challenges are intellectual. Thinking about CoC this way helps me understand the game in one way: make the game deadly and challenging, but logical and surmountable if you have luck and the wits. As the Keeper, you don't have to be a prisoner to the scenario \u2013 if a player comes up with a good solution that makes perfect sense, do allow it. Now, add memorable NPCs, evocative locations and all that story stuff.<br/><br/>Being the Keeper and playing the game that way takes skill, which you develop. As a player, you become more resourceful, and as Keeper, you hone your skills in writing memorable scenarios and fair challenges for the players. <br/><br/>I haven't ever played Cthulhu this way, but people have described it this way, and I get that feeling from Shadows of Yog-Sothoth (the first published campaign) and Masks of Nyarlathotep (a fine example of a sandbox-ish campaign that still has a plot).<br/><br/>The published scenarios and campaigns make up a lot of the CoC culture on the net. The best ones might be more time-consuming than doing stuff yourself, but you make up for it by reading a 400-page tome on an Antarctic expedition in the 1930s, a very well-designed modern day conspiracy setting (designed by folks who know more stuff on that subject than me), or by getting to know what the Kerguelens are. The best CoC scenarios and books are based on a ton of research, and you can partake in some of its fruit by reading it. And you learn other ways to play and design scenarios, to boot, if you're not lucky enough to have another GM in your area.<br/><br/>In the 1990s the Chaosium scenarios and campaigns took a turn for the pre-written, railroaded stories. That's one way to play the game. The Tatters of the King, a Hastur-themed campaign, published as late as 2006, is an example of that. It's been applauded, but I found it appalling: it's made for players to follow the story and play out the horror. There's insanely little freedom in the book, and several times the author instructs you to ask <i>for rolls that matter squat</i>. "Roll for Hide. Even if you succeed, they see you." And even if the GM would want to insert freedom into the campaign, it's made extremely difficult. The first part of the campaign is a huge, intertwined scenario, that has a gazillion moving parts and necessary clues, with no attempt to make it easy to digest or gather all the important stuff in one place.<br/><br/>Surely it's possible in theory to handle handwaving such stuff \u2013 and that takes skill, again. I didn't have it when I ran the campaign and forever swore myself off of prewritten adventures.<br/><br/>Then there's the school which looks like pre-written stories, but the authors make the assumption that you give players the ball \u2013 if they lose it, they just lose it and screw them. They don't see kill the monsters, they don't find out the truth behind stuff, they die ignorant like the specks of dirt they are on the cosmic scale. Dennis Detwiller, of Delta Green fame, talks of his stuff in this way, and a lot of my acquaintances play this way, too.<br/><br/>Many players and Keepers don't much mind for the rules, and a session without any dice-rolling is considered a good one. They can handle the quirks and the faults, because they've houseruled them ages ago, or simply don't ignore them for the sake of a good fright night. GUMSHOE has gotten a quite a lot of flak from the more militant of these; they've houseruled the "I missed the clue-gathering roll" ages ago or simply ignore the result, and think that designing a new game just to circumvent this is lunacy, and from I gather from the tone, <i>treachery</i>.<br/><br/>As I see it, Kenneth Hite formulated the most important rule <i>and</i> skill of playing Cthulhu: the Keeper's job is to scare the players, and the players job is to willingly get scared. Drop your guard and your cynicism. If as a player you ignore all the dangerous stuff, or throw inappropriate jokes, or can't stand the tension and the atmosphere, or if as a Keeper you're not intent on frightening the players, I don't want you in my game. <br/><br/>(As an aside, I think the <i>biggest problems</i> in horror gaming arise from players who contribute nothing, resist the building atmosphere, and expect the Keeper to do such a marvelous job that even dicks get scared.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/halski" title="halski"><img alt="halski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/halski">halski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366602/#Comment_366602" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T13:45:41+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  1:45PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2012 1:53PM by halski.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch<br/>Can we talk about the roads we took to understand and improve our CoC games without casting aspersions on other people's routes to this common place we enjoy?</cite><br/><br/>I borrowed the 4th edition book from a library in the 1990s, but never played it \u2013 instead, I read Lovecraft. I began my COC playing-career in a few Delta Green scenarios. I don't know how closely we followed the published scenarios, but I remember producing content: my character had a wife and a kid back home, and he phoned them every night, and bought his son an SF novel from a bookstore, and voted Republican. Sadly the other players weren't as much into this as I was, but the Keeper played along. The campaign died out when the Keeper executed two PCs <i>in absentia</i> and everyone pretty much lost interest.<br/><br/>A few years went by and I bought the butt-ugly sixth edition. I longed for the Tatters for the King campaign, above. It was supposed to be "Cthulhu done right" \u2013 with humane cultists, a logical plot, serious themes, and so on. It felt good to read, and I inflicted it on my players within a 1,5 years. As the campaign progressed, I began hating the tone of the book and the railroad structure, but almost without exception, everyone enjoyed the scenarios that we played. In retrospect, I felt I could've enjoyed it much more if I could've <i>played</i>, if I could've concentrated on what was happening and not what clues I was supposed to give out this time. The book doesn't always emphasize what's crucial for the story, so I ended up saying everything there was.<br/><br/>A couple of months into the campaign, I ran two scenarios at Ropecon. <br/><br/>The first, John Tynes' In Medias Res, an hour-long bloodbath in which you have a gripping starting situation, a location, and the intense characters. I ran it five times, and it got better every time once I'd gotten the gist of what makes the scenario tick and I'd learned to give all the players the proper instructions at the start. Each time was very different from others, and I threw all the dice after the first game.<br/><br/>The second, John Wick's The Curse of the Yellow Sign, Act 1. It's 1939, and six Nazis (the PCs) are in Africa to dig diamonds and use the natives ruthlessly as workforce. Of course, not everything goes as planned. It's very freeform, very bloody, and absolutely player-driven. There are a lot of things the Keeper must just make up on the fly and react to what the players do. And the players loved it, and did some really creepy, insane stuff just by adding to the fiction. <br/><br/>Then I finished the campaign, disappointed at the lack of freedom I'd so much enjoyed at the con games, and came out a lot wiser. <br/><br/>Before, during, and after those I've perused CoC and ToC tomes, read forums, listened to podcasts, read essays. I feel CoC has a become parallel Lovecraftian canon \u2013 at times it's far removed from what I enjoy in Lovecraft, but the end result is still enjoyable at times. However, I much prefer what Pelgrane and Graham have produced.<br/><br/>edit: I'm apparently not able to quote properly.

Dead weight is dead weight. I have lots of people in my regular D&amp;D group who wouldn't be into Cthulhu. They know it, I know it, they do other stuff that day.<br/><br/>- Make sure everyone realizes they are as responsible for the other players' fun, in their own way, as the Keeper or game designer are. You can reinforce this in micro-ways like:<br/>"What do you do?"<br/>"I don't know...hmmmm...."<br/>"Make <i>sure</i> it's something awesome..."<br/><br/>- When someone does something cool, make sure you immediately say "Wow, that was cool" or otherwise back it up. You can have a scary Cthulhu game without total immersion all day long, use the "meta" level to Carrot good play practices. (Examples....<br/><br/>- If a situation has turned out better (or worse)(or different) because of things the PCs did, point it out right then. "If only you;d left the key in the lock..." Remind them about their agency.<br/><br/>- If someone is actually very scarable, when they get scared, go ahead and say "I love playing Cthulhu with you". Like, being actually scared is a good thing a player did at your table.<br/><br/>- Emphasize the other players actions or inaction as factors in the scenario. If your detective is like "Stop freaking out, I'm trying to detect!" you're the Keeper, frame the freakout as a part of the scene. "Alright, if you can manage to get Adam to stop crying you might be able to hear well enough to hear the rats in the walls. Adam: you can see he's staring death-beams at you because he's trying to listen and you keep whimpering. What do you do?". Don't ignore what's there and hope it stops being a problem, use it. Make strengths out of weaknesses. Is someone not afraid? Say "Lisa is a rock in the face of the hideous abomination!" Is her character afraid but she's not? "Ok, Lisa, you failed your SAN check here, can anyone tell? Or is it some kind of silent thing has broken inside? How does the fear manifest itself?"<br/> <br/>- Related: the tensions in the real group can model tensions in the real game. That's ok. Show the players that: "Ok, Freddy is running around trying to find anything useful in the room while you two are just sort of staring dumbstruck in horror doing nothing, the awfulness of it all is kind of oozing up through your nervous system..." They either will do something about it or it becomes what the scenario is about.<br/><br/>-Remember: It's actually really hard to derail supernatural horror. The players blocking or bickering or steadystating is <i>perfect</i> for the monster. They cease to be a moving target and it can come to them. And point out the cause-and-effect "If you had left the hotel room, then it wouldn't have noticed, but since you just stood there for five minutes, it begins to uncoil..." You don't kill them for behaving wrong--that's bad Keeping. But you prod them a little with their own decisions.<br/><br/>-Be fair and never railroad. Point out when you are being fair. "Did the cops keep the car running? Ok, 50-50 chance..." If the players think you are being fair then they will indeed see that the consequences of their own actions are actually consequences of their own actions and take responsibility for stuff happening in the game. Many published Cthulhu scenarios are <i>terrible</i> at this--mostly because the "path not taken" path is one the game designer never had to GM so doesn't want to bother to write out. You don't have that luxury. If you railroad the players, they will stop thinking their actions matter and if they stop thinking their actions matter they will stop acting responsible for the fun at the table. Just because the foe is implacable does not mean the players' choices do not matter in terms of where, when, how, and with what resources the foe is confronted.<br/><br/>-Remember your main aesthetic job is to make the players' curious. Direct any resource you can spare toward that. If they are curious, then their freedom is not threatening because they will use it to investigate what you or the adventure-writer dreamed up and then you are playing the game. (You can always scare them later. But curiosity and fear both require an unknown at the center. Mystery begets horror.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366623/#Comment_366623" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T15:17:29+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  3:17PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, see, if <i>that</i> was the first page in the Call of Cthulhu book, that would make me very happy.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Good stuff, man.

Teaching GMing is like teaching art or writing, you can give good answers if you know<i> exactly what problem someone's having</i>, but there's very little general advice that is going to be broadly applicable to everybody reading.<br/><br/>That's why I don't think you can get too down on the trad rulebooks for their lack of GM direction: they are written for everybody ever in history who might pick up the game at any age or game literacy level. What they have to say may not be relevant at all to you or your GMing style.<br/><br/>Indie games (and other niche-directed games like Chris Hogan's OSR Warhammer retrofit Small But Vicious Dog) have the advantage of having a narrower and more knowable audience which has a set of familiar problems that can easily be addressed by an author who hangs in that mileu. Of course what the rulebook says is going to seem smart and relevant: it's directed <i>right at you</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366629/#Comment_366629" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T15:57:49+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  3:57PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>They only "will" if you actually read them or care about them or know about them.</blockquote>\nYou can't really avoid it in Call of Cthulhu, which includes at least one pre-written scenario in every corebook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366631/#Comment_366631" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T16:09:56+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  4:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2012 4:15PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>They only "will" if you actually read them or care about them or know about them.</blockquote>\nYou can't really avoid it in Call of Cthulhu, which includes at least one pre-written scenario in every corebook.<br/><br/>You can totally avoid it unless you have some bizarre disease which forces you to read every single word in any book you see<i> and</i> take it seriously.<br/><br/>Like, thousands of people every day go "<i>Sample adventure?</i> Fuck that."<br/><br/>Otherwise you do go down this path of "You gave me extra material!

It pays special attention to which sections are and are not read. It is highly trained in market research and is completely silent.<br/><br/>When a scoff is heard, the bird flies off, through the chimney if there is one, back to the Chaosium office in Hayward California. If the customer was further east than the Mississippi, further South than Juarez, further west than Hawaii or further north than Seattle the bird often takes a break in between. It generally stays at a Motel 6 if one is available and carries one of those glove-compartment where-are-all-the-Motel-6's? maps at all times. Overseas it generally stays with friends.<br/><br/>Upon reaching the offices in Hayward, the bird records its observations using a stenography machine with wooden stops, using a talon-keyed Morse device.<br/><br/>Once every three months, a small child with a red wagon wanders through the back door of the Chaosium offices--which has been left open because someone is trying to air out the consequences of things having been left in the communal fridge too long. The child removes the printed tape containing the nightingale's observations from the machine, copies them carefully in DaVinci mirror-writing and then transmits them to me--using methods too sensitive to disclose here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366641/#Comment_366641" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T16:56:57+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  4:56PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are two issues for me when it comes to running Mythos games (both of these are directly addressed by Ken in Trail of Cthulhu).

Obviously there's a strong link between these two issues. The way Lovecraft does this in fiction, and the way it's recommended that you do it in Call of Cthulhu, is by slowing building up to the reveal so that, much as how you'd cook a frog, the players don't realise how crazy the whole thing is until they're so deep into it that retreat is no longer much of an option.

Providing clearly-written advice to game masters and players that's not burdened by bullshit and half-baked ideas seems to be the essence of providing good game texts.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure I buy the idea of challenging the players in a CoC game. The idea of facing challenges and overcoming them is oblique to the Lovecraftian aesthetic. It can happen, but it's not core. You're never challenged by Cthulu. You're overwhelmed by it or (if you're lucky) you manage to survive and/or stay somewhat sane. You're not challenged by the mystery and the horror. They are things that happen beyond your control, leaving you mostly helpless to really make them come to you any faster or slower than they do. <br/><br/>You might be challenged by the cultists trying to grab you in the night. But it's never in the mode of staving of the horror. It's more a question of whether you're the one tied to the slab when the horror arrives. You might be challenged to unravel the mystery, but it's never in the mode of failing to uncover the mystery. It's more in the mode of what you know when the mystery turns to horror. When you try to make the challenge the core of the game, that's when Cthulu goes off the rails.<br/><br/>I've been told there's a whole mode of Cthulu play where this isn't true (again, killing Shoggoths with rocket launchers).

I also learned how to play it by running the published adventures.<br/><br/>I agree with Eero that the game rules do not tell you how to run the game, specifically. I mean, these are the same rules as Stormbringer and RuneQuest, and these three games are not the same. But I think the published adventures can do quite a good job of teaching you how the people who wrote CoC played it, and the way they assumed it would be played.<br/><br/>Of course you can play the game whichever way you want, they don't call it Basic Role-Playing for nothing. You can even do conflict resolution instead of task resolution, it's all there. But if your concept of "playing Call of Cthulhu" maps to the way the writers and designers of CoC were actually playing the game, then you want to check the adventures.<br/><br/>I find that they are a lot like Moldvay D&amp;D, except that in D&amp;D, players are exploring an unfamiliar environment that the DM has prepared in advance. In CoC, the players are investigating a set of relationships the Keeper has prepared in advance. Obscure relationships between clues and past events, secret relationships between conspirators, the true connections between a bunch of disparate pieces of evidence that all add up to some kind of Horrible Thing that nobody wants to happen. Sometimes Investigators do go to a strange place and explore it, but usually there is still some mystery-solving and a Horrible Thing that needs to be stopped and only gathering clues will make that happen. Often they're just in a town or city they already know, so they're not exploring it.<br/><br/>In a typical adventure, the Investigators are notified of a problem, and they wander around town looking for clues until they piece together some semblance of the Horrible Thing and then they go and try to stop it. And that's when most of them die or go permanently insane. Much like a dungeon, if you have your prep done, it's a setup that always works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366695/#Comment_366695" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T22:11:29+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 10:11PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>  I've been told there's a whole mode of Cthulu play where this isn't true (again, killing Shoggoths with rocket launchers). </blockquote>\nOr just running into Cthulhu with a boat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_366698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366698/#Comment_366698" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T22:34:29+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 10:34PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2012 10:35PM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience Call is a difficult game. I have played a fair number of times, and have observed that the game is very much dependent on how the leader handles it. The game falls flat with leaders that turn out nice game-play in other games, and that is an indication to me, that the game is harder to run than most classical games out there.<br/><br/>I believe this has to do with the inclusion of two great challenges in role-playing:<br/><br/><b>1 - The puzzle</b> ... is hard to do well. You balance on a knifes edge, and if you fail to get the balance right your players are either left clueless and feeling stupid, or they are left with cheap victories and little suspense.<br/><br/><b>2 - The horror</b>: it is hard to do well. To make it hit home you have to exercise a lot of control over the game-play, but that must be done in a way that leaves the players the necessary space to invest in their characters too. It's both a balancing act and a psycho-social challenge. The psycho-social challenge is to have the players invest emotionally in the characters and the situation. Without that investment the game feels lame.<br/><br/>The tools to do these things are not part of the game. They have to be invented by the leader. Leaving two great challenges like these to be met, simultaneously, by intuition and inventiveness, makes <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> a very hard game to run, in my view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366700/#Comment_366700" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T22:45:14+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 10:45PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2012 10:46PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The puzzle you handle like this:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2012/02/hunterhunted.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2012/02/hunterhunted.html</a><br/><br/>The horror is your own business as a creative GM.

Sure, fun romps where everyone plays along with monstery scariness, but actual <i>chills down your spine when you read them</i> level scary? Nah, not even close to what other writers put out. Hell, Two Gun Bob Howard's Cthulhu stuff is generally scarier than HPL's.<br/><br/>So if you answered, <i>No, they ain't really that scary</i>, then trying to run the game at this super high value of scary for your players is actually shooting for a higher mark than the inspirational materal manages to achieve.<br/><br/>Let's try another really basic question: Do we really see such deeply complex, developed characters in HPL's stories that we truly become fascinated with them, or are they mostly just quickly drawn sketches that are a vehicle to get us to the important part of the story, which are the descriptions of weird monsters and events?<br/><br/>Yeah, ya already know what my answer to this is by the only slightly biased way I phrased that last question.<br/><br/>If you're shooting for more player to character involvement and development, you are once again shooting for a higher mark than the actual source material.<br/><br/>Tomas, go back and really look at my post comparing CoC to Moldvay Basicif yu want to run CoC successfully.<br/><br/>It might not give you the vision of what CoCought to be that you have, but it will quite likely give you a successful game play session, and it isn't hard at all to play, either on the part of the players or the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366703/#Comment_366703" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T23:08:54+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 11:08PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><b>1 - The puzzle</b>... is hard to do well.

Call of Cthulhu was written back in an age when this element was largely left to the leaders of games. Containing the challenge of creating a scare, this game suffered more from the lack of oral/storytelling/leader-advice than most games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>The Call of Cthulhu system isn't explained in the text. It's taught at the gaming table.</blockquote>So the leader has to teach herself, at the table? I hold that to be a poor way for a designer to aim for great game-play with his game. I'd rather see the designer giving out tools that make the trip better for more players, not only for those with leaders able to invent a method of play on-the-spot.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Call of Cthulhu is not a difficult game.<br/><br/>It is Moldvay era Basic D&amp;D, set in the 1920s, with a mystery's network of clues replacing a physical dungeon's series of rooms. ...</blockquote>I am sorry to say that this does not make it for me. Far from it. You say nothing of how to set the tone, serve the clues, handle the psychology of the characters, etc.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Start with the Horrible Thing, whatever it is, and then figure out what various clues it leaves behind, that could potentially reveal it to the world. ...</blockquote>Nice way of telling how to set up the clues, but is that really the great challenge in this game? I would rather see you telling people, as straightforward, how to set the tone, handle the tilted conflicts, putting a scare into a scene, etc.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Let's start with something terribly basic: Are Lovecraft's stories in fact scary?</blockquote>The question is, in fact, not relevant. What is relevant when discussing the game, is the expectations of the players, and I have never heard anyone talk about Call of Cthulhu as anything but a horror game. Most people consider it a horror game, and are expecting the thrill of horror when they play it. Ideally the players <span style="text-decoration: underline;">want to be scared</span> by it!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Let's try another really basic question: Do we really see such deeply complex, developed characters ... or are they mostly just quickly drawn sketches that are a vehicle to get us to the important part of the story, ...</blockquote>In role-playing games I'm all for the quickly drawn sketches at game-start, and then to see complex characters develop in lieu with the drama. The brunt of players don't care how a "true" lovecraftian character looks like; they want a character to use in heated interaction. If they buy into the <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> thing, they will enjoy making a clueless nincompoop about to be beset by horrible monsters, and they will wonder if survival is at all possible. And then, if the method really catch hold of them, they will fight nail and teeth to keep that nincompoop alive! In Call of Cthulhu I have seen that the method is too rudimentary to make this happen most of the time. I've had some magic moments there, with great leaders, but most of the sessions have been lame.<br/><br/>The game is dependent on the leader; can she manage to invent a method to work magic?<br/><br/>I'm not concerned about running Call of Cthulhu myself. I know I have developed the tools to do it. I am more concerned with leaders lacking those tools, being given a game that points in the right direction and leave you to wander the woods of confusion all by yourself.

is that really the great challenge in this game? I would rather see you telling people, as straightforward, how to set the tone, handle the tilted conflicts, putting a scare into a scene, etc.<br/><br/>I don't know what you mean by tilted conflicts, but the tone and scaring people aren't something I would expect in a game text. Maybe I don't consider them part of the "play procedures" in Eero's OP. You pick the tone based on what narrative techniques are available to you, is what I've always assumed. If you watch horror movies and read horror stories (or suspense, or mystery, or whatever) then you can use that stuff when running the game, but that's part of the fiction, not the rules. The procedures of an investigation is something you <i>can</i> learn from the game, though (in my experience).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_366720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366720/#Comment_366720" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T03:39:02+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  3:39AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 3:39AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've come to expect the text of role-playing games to give me all I need to make the game lift, including tools of storytelling and leadership, if they are crucial to the game.<br/><br/>But that is a new approach still, and certainly not one that was present in the days of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>.<br/><br/>I do not expect leaders of a game to educate themselves as game-leaders by reading text written in other mediums. I doubt the benefits of reading a novel or short story, or a poem, in relation to leading a role-playing game. I would prefer to have my text on a game to be about that particular game, and directly helpful in revealing the methodology by which that game may come alive.<br/><br/>I do love Call of Cthulhu! It is one of my favorite classical games. But I have no problem seeing that it comes with the flaws many games of that period suffered from; a lot were left to the game-leader to sort out and invent, in terms of the actual play-method. <br/><br/>I do not care to defend a game, even a favorite of mine, on the basis of what some people have made out of it, on their own. Talking about their individual methods, and learning from them is interesting. But when we are talking about the game itself; I find it more constructive to talk about it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as is</span>, and to learn from that when it comes to writing my own games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366725/#Comment_366725" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T04:03:38+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  4:03AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not a CoC veteran (ToC, yes), but I'm really weirded out by the idea that you should scare the players. I'm sitting with a bunch of friends, rolling dice and riffing on monsters straight out of popculture. If I actually got anxious during the game because of the content, I'd quit. <br/><br/>If I wanted to do a horror game where the players were supposed to experience real terror, I'd make it about real mental disorders and crippling addictions in our own age instead of escapist supernatural threats wrecking havoc in a safely removed retro environment. But people play Cthulhu instead of Requiem for a Dream RPG, because they want to solve fun mysteries instead of getting genuinely disturbed.<br/><br/>Maybe people are talking about character horror instead of player horror. But that ain't that hard to do, really. You can have rules for characters getting scared and crazy. Now, mysteries that interest the players, that's a slightly bigger challenge, and that's in my mind what Cthulhu roleplaying is all about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366726/#Comment_366726" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T04:06:59+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  4:06AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 8:01AM by Johnstone.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, I more or less agree with the standards you are calling for in game texts, Tomas.

(Do you mean something else?) In this case, the game is dependent on genre conventions (horror). In order to know the language of the genre, you need to read the language of the genre. Or to quote the old maxim: "If you want to be a writer, you need to write. If you want to be a good writer, you need to read." Because if you don't read, how are you going to know how to write? Analysis can act as a short-cut to understanding the genre, but a game text is not going to give you the actual language of the genre itself. Even if CoC was written in such a way that its procedures were explained perfectly, it still could not teach someone with no familiarity with horror how to speak about the game's premise.

On the one hand, the mechanics suggest that you should have weapons, and use them. Cthulhu has hit points, for goodness' sake. On the other hand the text suggests that weapons are pointless and counterproductive. This contradiction has led to divergent play styles which in Trail are described as Pulp and Purist. Graham's Purist adventures and style of GMing are totally different to those at the more Pulp end. Lovecraft contains both, though it's his followers who tended more towards the Pulp end.<br/><br/>I personally don't think that the text of Call of Cthulhu engenders what is now a considered a Call of Cthulhu game straight out of the box. It hasn't been updated as a result of how people are actually playing the game, and the CoC experience is transmitted orally. Like D&amp;D and for historical reasons it's one of the most house ruled games in existence. I've played in a decent number of  games, and there isn't one where the rules haven't been hand-waived to improve play. That's to it's credit. It is much loved, and people have played it a lot. <br/><br/>The other possibility is that I'm wrong and that it is so good at transmitting the play that was originally intended, it never really needed updating. I'd love to hear from people who have played with Sandy Petersen to understand what kind of game he intended.<br/><br/>In some ways Trail is Ken Hite's love letter to CoC; he still considers it the best RPG of all time. Trail in both system and advice in some sense codifies best CoC practice. In fact, one objection to Trail from long-time Call of Cthulhu is "I don't this - I'm doing this already."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366732/#Comment_366732" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T05:42:41+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  5:42AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't find HPL scary either.

It's about as helpful as AD&amp;D in telling you how to play the game. That said, I ran the game for many years without owning the rulebook because all the best stuff that happens in the game is nothing much to do with the rules. For me it's about mystery, a recognisable historical setting (sometimes even an accurate one) and the sword of Damocles. It's properly heroic and exciting, but in a downbeat kind of way.

The <i>characters</i> in a horror game should be scared, which does require that the in-game threat be something that's plausibly scary, but the players sitting at the table?  Scaring them is not required; the best horror games I've played in kept the threats and creepiness strictly in-game and targeted at the characters, and had a table full of players who were grinning and immensely pleased at how petrified their PCs were by all of it.<br/><br/>As always, if everyone at your table is on board with you trying to scare the bejesus out of them, that's cool: go ahead and turn down the lights and use a creepy voice and throw cats at their faces or whatever it is that you do to terrify people in real life.  But assuming that this is the only way to do it, and/or forcing it on people who didn't necessarily sign up for that?

It was the opposite reaction I had to Cthulhu Dark by Graham over there (although I do think Cthulhu Dark works best if you've already had the training wheels of BRPThulhu to get you started). Several elements of ToC though are deeply useful, even to long-time CoC vets, most of them in the sense of being distillations of Best Practices for creating the clues for a mystery and tying them to the skills of the characters or in taking a new look at what those old well worn monsters could be interpretted as to spiff them up a bit.<br/><br/>Tomas:<br/>I'll concede some of those points. Older game texts do tend to assume you have done outside reading or watching of material that inspires and informs the game to be played, and does indeed often gloss over key elements that would help with the actual play of the game.<br/><br/>I admit I'm a bit unclear how one might decide to play CoC without some minimal background interest in mysteries or monsters, just as I'm a bit at a loss to see how someone would be terribly interested in D&amp;D without some grounding in some sort of swords and wizards type fantasy. I mean, at minimum, I'd expect a would-be player or GM of CoC to have watched Scooby Doo or Ghostbusters as a kid,  just like I'd expect someone to have taken in an old Robin Hood or King Arthur movie to even want to play D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I very much disagree with the idea of skipping the initial sample adventures in the  core book. The Haunting is a flawed introduction to the game in some ways, much likeThe Keep on the Bordelands is in ways a flawed introduction to Basic D&amp;D. Both do however lay down some of the basic, core play concepts that will classically come up repeatedly, especially regarding how the PCs apply themselves to exploration of the event at hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366755/#Comment_366755" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T07:24:09+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  7:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Most people consider it a horror game, and are expecting the thrill of horror when they play it.

GM adds complications or adjudicate resolutions, next situation, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis being Call of Cthulhu, the presentation of the situation might require a bit of narrative skill playing suitably unhinged and creepy NPCs and describing things that are literally indescribable, but with practice (a few props and some creepy music help) you get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the big deal here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366810/#Comment_366810" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T10:42:40+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:42AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll toss in a bit of background here as well.  I'm currently playing in a weekly Call of Cthulhu campaign that we're playing by-the-book, and I've also been playing a mostly-diceless monthly campaign that's currently on hiatus.  My weekly group had initially started playing Trail of Cthulhu, and we tried that for 4 or 5 sessions, but we decided to switch back to original Call of Cthulhu instead.  <br/><br/>Aside from a one-shot game or two at conventions, I was really introduced to Call of Cthulhu in the mid-nineties, and I later ran my own campaign 2006-07.  The former used a number of house rules (notably using Tarot cards), while the latter was roughly straight as far as rules, though I did introduce effects on the player characters during my own adventures not included in the rules.  <br/><br/>I'd agree that there are lots of variants and house-ruled versions of Call of Cthulhu, which I think is mainly a sign that it is well-liked by the community which has a lot of Do-It-Yourselfers.  (Similarly, there are a lot of hacks and variants of Apocalypse World in the current story games community.)  I personally haven't seen any sign of an oral culture separate from the published adventures and other material.  For example, I can run a by-the-book Call of Cthulhu game at a convention around here and players don't seem surprised or have trouble adjusting.  Again, that might not be true in other places.  <br/><br/>One note about the importance of sample and published adventures.  I would totally agree that there are many GMs who ignore the sample adventure - just as there are many GMs who house rule many points in the rules.  However, I still think that the sample and other published adventures set a baseline from which the GMs intentionally vary.  Also note that following published adventures doesn't mean the GM running those adventures like a mindless robot - it means treating the given material is a base to creatively work from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366824/#Comment_366824" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T11:05:57+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:05AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, some people prefer boxers to briefs.<br/><br/>But anybody going "Well briefs are <i>better </i>because of the many modern innovations involved--such as elastic loops where your legs go" is just doing the whole opinion-as-fact thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366832/#Comment_366832" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T11:17:42+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:17AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No modern method or product has ever been better than its predecessor.

That a thing can be mocked does not mean it is wrong or bad. <br/><br/>In my case, my position is not that nothing has been learned from previous games or that improvements have not been made. My position is that a new thing being good does not render an old thing bad. To me that reads like this: "There is a new thing, ergo we can stop learning from the old thing, which must be bad because of its oldness."<br/><br/>While I knew that <b>(a)</b> a vibrant and vital RPG community has been sadly unserved and unreached by many existing, established, elder games, I am only recently able to accept and overcome the idea that <b>(b)</b> elements of that community sees this not as the result of missed opportunities or poor fits between material and audience but as the objective, decisive awfulness of existing, established, elder games. Alas, <b>(b)</b> is a damned shame, as it represents the same kind of gap in appreciation or imagination that caused <b>(a)</b>.<br/><br/>I say there's a lot to glean and learn from decades of play of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>. I say we can communicate and share those ideas in ways that improve everyone's bounty. I object to the notion that we must declare <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> or its ilk "badly written" or poor design\u2014whether directly or through hyperbolic sarcasm\u2014to begin this process.<br/><br/>If <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> is so lousy then why have people been playing it for a generation? (Note that houseruling is a form of play.)<br/><br/>If <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> is a difficult game\u2014I agree that it certainly can be and that this is not a bug\u2014how else can we make it easier to play? What do we gain or lose by doing so? I'm terribly biased, but I like <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i>'s approach and solutions quite a bit, either for play or for hacking and houseruling back into CoC. Whole books can be, have been, and should be still written on this subject, IMO.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will<br/><br/><i>(Many and varied edits.)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366852/#Comment_366852" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T12:06:10+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 12:06PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you gotta admit that it takes some doing to get an OSR fan to even admit to the possibility that something could be improved upon in a roleplaying game. After all, the hobby is too young to have seen any genuine development, the issues involved are universal and eternal, etc. Basically, everything is as good as it's ever going to be, which means that it's perfect. The only gauge we therefore have for critical writing is, who did this perfect thing first?<br/><br/>Anybody who feels the need to engage the above paragraph seriously needs to have their irony meter checked. All part of the service.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, I think that there have been practical implementations of most any game that have been extremely functional, reasonable, intricate and in all ways excellent as cultural practices. Anybody who thinks that roleplaying game texts are just taken and executed like computer programs is kidding: the more vague a text, the more variety there will be in execution. In this regard it's completely meaningless to say that a given game, practice of it included, is "bad": what if somebody else who is not you encountered what he needed with that same game text, and then went forth to play excellent games with it? In this regard we can only say that the Call of Cthulhu <i>game text is difficult</i>, not that the game it references is bad. Even saying that the text is difficult is just a matter of writing craft and pedagogical strategy: I don't know, maybe the guys who didn't have any difficulties with it are a big fat majority and there's something wrong with me, as I clearly took years and years to get even a dim understanding of how the game runs.<br/><br/>I guess the above is just a restatement of what I said upthread: I don't think that CoC is a bad game, I just think that you could write more about how to play it well. My own games have oft been accused of being densely written and not suited for all audiences, so I can definitely sympathise: you can never write for all audiences at once, it's just a fact of life. The solution is to address the problems, write better texts, admit that better texts are possible to be written, learn about how others see the world, address that in writing, and continue doing that until you've achieved a sufficient level of clarity. I happen to think that this level has not been reached with old traditional games like say Call of Cthulhu or most other games written in the '80s or '90s; around here low-quality play due to unclear game texts is almost endemic, it would be difficult for me to think otherwise. I've never thought that other people are not having fun in their games, though, even if I think that the game texts that apparently are the basis of their play are rather difficult to understand correctly (that is, in a way that leads to fun play).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366855/#Comment_366855" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T12:15:16+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 12:15PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify the above, I'm working off the assumption that it is obvious to everybody that the praxis of Call of Cthulhu has been excellent in some place and time in the past. To me this is obvious, you simply can't write with the passion and inspiration I've witnessed in many CoC-related game texts without actually having functional and fun long-term play behind it. For this reason the question to me is not whether CoC is bad, but rather how the game text could be improved upon - either by writing new texts entirely stand-alone, or by writing commentaries upon existing texts. The texts might be difficult or even bad as descriptions of how to play the game when considered purely pedagogically (this my current standing, personally, although I don't particularly need any of you to convince me otherwise), but that doesn't change the fact that people who fortunately match with the text have been able to build upon it and get a fun gaming experience.<br/><br/>I mean, this is not a difficult proposition. I'm tempted to say that anybody who started roleplaying with D&amp;D is almost out of the running in this discussion to begin with, as that guy's going to have trouble even understanding the experience our kind of group had with Call of Cthulhu in the early '90s; the D&amp;D guy will obviously see a pretty easy monster-hunting game as described upthread, but what about the gamers who are passionate about Lovecract, take traditional ideas about plot and character immersion seriously, and then read that game text? It's not going to be pretty, and it's not going to be easy, I assure you. That game-book is full of two-faced discussion and refusals to take a stand on what we're even doing in the game, everybody's going to see exactly what they expect to see in there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_366858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366858/#Comment_366858" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T12:24:12+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 12:24PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I admit I'm a bit unclear how one might decide to play CoC without some minimal background interest in mysteries or monsters, just as I'm a bit at a loss to see how someone would be terribly interested in D&amp;D without some grounding in some sort of swords and wizards type fantasy.

Cthulhu is a grocery store for handling all of these, not a recipe book for one of them.<br/><br/>Some recipes are included in the form of published scenarios, the recipe should not be mistaken for the grocery store.

Also, I'd like to add that I think that the wide open net many traditional games cast is really exciting and seductive when you first get into the hobby, it's a great promise of boundless possibilities. Too much so, in hindsight; we totally would have prospered as roleplayers in my teenage group if we had more discipline and direction in our practice instead of all of these game texts that promised that somehow, given a sufficient amount of color commitment and patience, a fulfilling game experience (that is, one that feels like something was accomplished) will materialize. I'm sure other people will have different needs, but for us these generic games that have no structure beyond providing fictional setting and a vague suggestion of maybe forming a team of adventurers, these games were too vague for us to really form firm gameplay. For years our roleplaying efforts were spent in examining the possibilities and tools instead of achieving truly functional play consistently.<br/><br/>I could imagine that even a beginning roleplayer might prefer a non-committal toolbox game, if they had a different mind from mine. For example, people often complain about things related to gaming that make no sense to me. The need to purchase new game books and <i>read</i> them, for instance: this is totally a non-issue for me, and has always been, so I simply don't see the benefit in making your game difficult and flexible so that it can be used for "anything!" the reader might think up. I'll be quite happy to buy Dread:T1stBoP for the "Shoggoth in my trunk" monster-hunting needs, or that other Dread for insanity immersion horror, or so on. I can't be playing all of these games at once, so I'd rather take the more exact and supportive game text over the flexibility.<br/><br/>This is not to say that I think that a generic and vague game is hopeless. I find the OSR example rather inspiring, in fact: now that people are writing about old school D&amp;D in concrete and value-laden ways, without the need to keep everything TSR-official and generic, we're seeing a massive surge of honest, specific writing that is doing wonders for people like myself to finally grog how D&amp;D can be played as a powerful, relevant game. I believe that the same goes for e.g. Cthulhu, you don't need to think that a guy will either get it or miss it by reading the book: tell us more about how the game is properly used, and we <i>will</i> understand and catch the spark.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Praxis</cite>I'd like to point out that pre-5th editions of CoC have a chapter called 'How to Run the Game' which specifically deals with what you are talking about and it pretty explicitly states "the supernatural is going to get you whether you want it or not" if not in exactly those words.  5th and 6th are slightly different, the chapter being expanded and the title changed to 'Keeper's Lore' which was formerly a subheading in 'How to Run the Game'.</blockquote>\nYeah, these games have advice sections. It's just that you know, you read interpretatively, trying to match what you read into known patterns. And often the game is full of contradictory advice, as it tries to embrace all the possible ways to play the game at once. And then you have sample adventures that might or might not be relevant to that GMing advice - it's almost a dictum at this point that a traditional game text will embrace entirely different GMing techniques in advice and sample adventure writing, simply because the two modes of writing craft have different heritages that both unfortunately got into the one game book.<br/><br/>I remember how I read the 6th edition book (it's the one with the blue-dark cover?) two years back, thinking of revisiting the game and seeing whether I would be any smarter about it in comparison with the '90s, when I played it semi-regularly. The game is still the same, and in my fresh reading I was struck by how two creative agendas fight on its pages: on the one hand the sections intended for prospective players emphasize success in adventuring quite a bit, providing hints and trips for winning the scenario and so on, but then the GMing section tends to mostly lean towards the idea that you're doing a cooperative horror story here, with all sorts of interesting ties between things as a campaign develops - and then the sample adventures are the same railroad-fests they were fifteen years ago. I can't say that I would have been any more convinced about there being one, true way of playing CoC after that reading experience - it's clearly a game that does not want to commit to anything beyond the Lovecraftian color (excellent, still - I have huge respect for the feel of scholarship you get from CoC gamebooks, even if these parts of the core book have gone unrevised since what, 3rd edition). It read like it was written by multiple people, none of which were willing to take a true stand as to what the game is about; this is probably the truth of the matter.<br/><br/>(Interestingly enough, reading CoC then inspired me about something that doesn't have a very good game committed to it: it would be interesting to play CoC sandbox style, using a map of maybe let's say my own home county, littering it with Mythos weirdness rooted into the local history. The arc of the campaign would revolve around the inevitability of the encounter with the madness for some poor people who live in the area, so that mostly the player characters would have a choice over which mysteries to explore. No pressures of any sort about "solving" anything, as the sandbox has variety and the supernatural is assumed to provoke the PCs regularly if they get stuck. Sort of like a combination of a D&amp;D sandbox and Cthulhu, without foregrounding the latter's railroading scenario technique, but very much preserving the feel. While there are games that beat Cthulhu 10-0 for say monster-hunting or immersive railroad storytelling, I don't think I can name an off-the-shelf title for this obviously CoC-compatible campaign structure. Even if I dropped the dry %-based character spec - I would almost rather go freeform now - I can totally see using the monster and arcana material from CoC for this kind of campaign even in this day and age.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366893/#Comment_366893" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T13:18:52+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  1:18PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 1:19PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>It's not my job, as a lover of a thing, to defend it against all comers as some hallmark of perfection.

The chance that the event occurs goes up or down depending on the difference between the active quality and the passive opposing quality.<br/><br/>Specifically if your character is the owner of the acting quality, each point of difference above the value of the passive quality causes you to have a +5% chance. If your quality is orated lower, there's a -5% chance for each point of difference.<br/><br/>The chart just lets you cross-reference the two numbers, rather than actually doing the math.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366905/#Comment_366905" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T13:38:30+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  1:38PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 1:40PM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Eero, the wrong-headed-to-me thing that has had me on the defensive in this thread was your statement that books like CoC were "intentionally badly written," which sort of threw out of whack my ability to make the assumptions you have since described as obvious.

This doesn't mean that there isn't room for ancillary writing that delves into the details. I don't also think that there is a pregorative for Call of Cthulhu of all things to be or become the bestest, favouritest roleplaying game of all time; it can be and remain a classic of the form, and a flexible tool for the experienced roleplayer. As I've intimated in this thread several times, I await the time when things like Graham's book become more of a default in the roleplaying culture: there are a lot of games out there that could use such, even if only these most iconic and classic cases are realistic targets of marginalia and further writing.<br/><br/>At the same time, I have to admit that I don't see a way for Cthulhu to truly be a better game than it already is, if we refuse focus. I mean "better" in a strictly functional way, in that the game is not going to be more usable for a wider number of people if it is not cut down and stripped of some things while adding other tools useful for this newly-chosen exclusive focus. Very much like the 4th edition of D&amp;D in this regard. As the game is, it remains a difficult one. Maybe something like the modular approach they've been speculating for 5th edition D&amp;D would retain both clear focus and the free scope of the original, but I would rather see this happen with Cthulhu in the form of progeny works like Graham's; I've always felt that the commercial bullshit "editions" of D&amp;D are not civilized publishing behaviour. "Call of Cthulhu", the game text by that name, is what it is, and I wouldn't want to make any radical changes to pretend that it's something it is not. Full respect to Chaosium for its bibliographical honesty, even if it might be caused in part by passive publishing strategy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366917/#Comment_366917" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T14:09:06+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  2:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my part, I certainly don't think that the Call of Cthulhu text is flawless.  As a player in a current campaign, I'm frequently finding issues I have with the text, and I'm rather annoyed that they haven't improved over six editions.  <br/><br/>In general, though, I think that RPGs are much like movies or clothes.  Over the decades, there have been many technological improvements in film and clothing, but at the same time most of the changes over the decades are about changing tastes/fashion.  First and foremost, these are creative works, and the quality is tied to a general vision.  There are frequent re-makes of classic movies and revivals of fashions, but often I don't find that the revisions are really improvements on the original, despite improved technology.  <br/><br/>I feel similarly about RPGs.  My favorite RPGs are not all the latest, nor are they all old.  I sometimes find that older games are improved for my tastes: like how Hero System 4th edition is in my opinion the best version.  Often, though, I find that attempts to re-make a game don't result in improvement for my tastes.  I'd include James Bond 007, Mouse Guard, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Polaris, Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks, 1001 Nights, and others in my favorite RPGs.  <br/><br/>In particular for Lovecraftian horror, I don't think that the updates/replacements suggested in this thread would be general improvement <i>for my taste in games</i> - even for particular subgenres.  I've tried Dead of Night and Trail of Cthulhu, for example, and while I had an OK time with them, I wouldn't consider either as a replacement for Call of Cthulhu.  (I've read Dread and Cthulhu Dark, but I haven't read the full Stealing Cthulhu.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366919/#Comment_366919" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T14:10:14+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  2:10PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I wouldn't change CoC myself to make it<i>lose</i>in possibilities, I agree with the traditionalists in that it would be a shame to do so.

My own view on this has largely been that find it difficult to read generic advice, and all the more so as I gain experience. Advice in good play is so <i>situational</i>, all the generic advice starts sounding like so much bleating by ill-informed armchair theorists. This is totally not the fault of the adviser, it's the context of hearing the advice: give me your generic advice of "how to be a good GM", and I just can't decide what <i>sort</i> of good GM you mean, but tell me how to be a good Call of Cthulhu GM and I'm all ears, busy matching the game's features to what you're saying. Heck, one might argue that the excellent GMing section of <i>Dread</i> is nothing more special than "how to be a a good CoC GM", but I still read it and understand it better because I come fresh off a mechanical and procedural text that this advice directly combines with. You could probably put almost the same text into a CoC book, and while you would advice <i>against</i> many apparently popular possibilities of CoC, you would also make the game ten times more appealing to me, coming to the game with no preconceptions and just wanting some suggestions as to how I should spend my evening with friends.<br/><br/>It is true that my opinion is coloured by a particular Forgean read on the history of traditional rpg writing: I think that the form has been hurt by an insistence on the generic, caused by commercial interest and conventions of game-writing. Starting in the late '80s I can no longer take game texts as entirely honest attempts at describing what the game is like that the writer is playing. What I see, instead, is people writing game book sections on the model of other game books they've read in the past, and people writing procedural and methodological theory of how to play their game not on the basis of their own true experience, but rather in a mealy-mouthed attempt at saying all things to all people: yes, you can play my game in this way and that way, and you can do this as well - anything, as long as you buy my book! This is where we get those game mechanics detached from reality, and contrary advices where the GM is supposed to provide the players with a complex rules system on one hand while ignoring that system on the other.<br/><br/>Considering the above general interpretation I carry regarding a majority of what we call "traditional" in game-writing, it is no wonder if I would much rather see more specific instruction on how to play specific games. Get as close to the ground as you can, I've already gotten a life-time of advice that starts with "The GM is one part referee, one part dramatist, one part novelist..." This advice might be generic, it might even be true, but it stopped being useful to me a long ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366928/#Comment_366928" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T14:37:38+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  2:37PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...and it is this "color" I find only tells half the story.<br/><br/>Presumably you can see how, if you instead had the view "My players and I have our own ideas before even picking up the book, this text is a bunch of expected bullshit wrapped around some tools for making those ideas into a game" you might have quite a different take on genericness.

It's just that you know, you read interpretatively, trying to match what you read into known patterns. And often the game is full of contradictory advice, as it tries to embrace all the possible ways to play the game at once. And then you have sample adventures that might or might not be relevant to that GMing advice - it's almost a dictum at this point that a traditional game text will embrace entirely different GMing techniques in advice and sample adventure writing, simply because the two modes of writing craft have different heritages that both unfortunately got into the one game book.</blockquote>\nPersonally I don't see a lot of conflicting info, the Investigator sections generally go out of their way to warn players about the potential outcome of physical combat and the effective immortality of the Great Old Ones, and the section discussing how Sandy Petersen omitted the 'War in Heaven' themes of later Mythos authors because it mitigates the horror, all point towards an 'intended' style of play. I see plenty of systemic and textual support for this intention in CoC (whereas I don't see much in LotFP: WFRP that necessitates or suggests 'weird' fantasy) even though the BRP system is certainly robust enough for other styles. As encompassing play styles goes though, I have to hand it to Realms of Cthulhu's Gritty/Pulpy way of tuning physical and mental damage to a campaign's flavor.<br/><br/>I do like your idea for a Mythos sandbox, it might be fun to use the Dresden Files: Our World method for setting creation and fully embrace the cooperative horror storytelling aspect of CoC, plus it helps get the players invested in their surroundings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366951/#Comment_366951" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T15:57:21+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  3:57PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 3:58PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>I think it is good that CoC is a difficult game and I think this is particular (but not exclusive) to CoC.

And going back to an older game, once you have "learned the language" (so to speak) of its intended play style is a pretty magical thing. But I don't think that frank discussion of an older text's perceived flaws is a call to retrofit the harbor.

That seems less likely to me than simply getting a group on the same page to do one thing, but perhaps I'm wrong.</blockquote>\nFirst, can we agree that what's "likely" only matters if you sell games for a living or run games with strangers a lot?<br/><br/>Second, can we agree that the "game that does one thing well" is pretty much a core Story-Games idea?<br/><br/>Third, can we agree that maybe the people who use one game to do lots of things might just be different kinds of people than you and leave it at that?<br/>For what it's worth, here's my two cents: <br/><br/>1) Generally agreed.  However, even though I don't sell games, I do have some curiosity about what play is like in the world outside my circles.  <br/><br/>2) I agree with JDCorley on this.  I don't think that the core mechanics Primetime Adventures, Spirit of the Century, Dogs in the Vineyard, or Apocalypse World are particularly narrower than more traditional systems.  The difference between a universal system and a focused system is more often an issue of packaging than of underlying game design.  One way to organize is to publish a generic set of rules like the Pool, Risus, FATE 1.0, GURPS, etc. - and then release adaptations of those core mechanics for different settings.  Another approach is to publish a series of games that use the same underlying mechanics (called a "house system" or core rules).  <br/><br/>3) I'm certainly on board with saying that tastes differ.  I don't think that means that we have to drop discussion, though.  For example, someone else might think that Trail of Cthulhu is easy to run and more fun than Call of Cthulhu - while I think that Call of Cthulhu is easier and more fun.  We can still talk about the intersection of our tastes, though, along with differences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366991/#Comment_366991" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T19:02:11+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  7:02PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zak's not saying that all Story Games favourite games are hyper-specific. He's saying that the ideal that a game should do one thing well is a popular core idea at Story Games the forum (I think, based on capitalization).<br/><br/>I don't think the above is particularly controversial. I mean, Jason might disagree, but especially compared to the rest of the Internet, surely the Forge and here are the most prominent forums where you might find posters who whole-heartedly agree with the idea that a good game is focused on doing one thing well? It's a local peculiarity/wisdom/value. Doesn't mean that everybody thinks so or that all games are like that, just that it's a trend peculiar to here. This is often taken up as some sort of flaw in our thinking, but I think it's an entirely fair characterization. Heck, I would find it strange if you truly couldn't make a game <i>better</i> in what it does by honing its focus. It's a perfectly reasonable idea that a good game is a focused one that doesn't waste attention and leave out tools due to a misguided wish to appeal to a wide market. I'm sympathetic to the idea, and so are many other people I know around these parts.<br/><br/>Of course, I also happen to think that games like Universalis, Primetime Adventures, Apocalypse World... these are all totally hyper-specific when compared to a thing like Call of Cthulhu. Sure, some of these sport e.g. setting universality, but they all have such exact methodology of play that I can compare anything you might do with those games to the best practices and tell you whether you're utilizing the game as intended. (Not all of these games are written quite clearly enough to enable this boast from the core text alone, but a bit of forum-reading about designer intent and underlying theory suffices; compare to CoC, where even the designer will apparently tell you that he did not intend for any particular way of playing the game - at least most pundits will claim such, as opposed to claiming that the designer just couldn't write very clearly.)<br/><br/>Obviously I don't think that swapping out a setting for another one is a particularly radical chance to a game as long as the core methodology of play remains the same. But then, this is another one of these Forge-isms, I've met gamers for whom it's somehow totally radical that now we're playing D&amp;D in space, dude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366992/#Comment_366992" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T19:05:52+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  7:05PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Zak's not saying that all Story Games favourite games are hyper-specific.

Actual play is easier, "game" in the sense of concrete activity: I don't think I've yet to see an Internet subculture that would insist on some completely contrary meaning for that. But the moment we get away from the specific session of play, the perspectives start to differ: what is caused by the decision to play this particular game, what is caused by these particular players, what <i>should</i> be the role of the text, what rise from personal inspiration.<br/><br/>Makes it both boring and interesting to read OSR peoples' thoughts: on the one hand it's boring when a guy totally misses the structural differences between say D&amp;D and western because he has D&amp;D-inditis in his brain and everything looks like a team-structured, challenge-based adventure to him (I probably picked this example because of the long western sequence in Knights of the Dinner Table), but then also it's really interesting to see how creatively games get adapted, sometimes showing the same cultural material in new and surprising light. For example, I would say that <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> entire can be read as an extensive "roleplayer's critical deconstruction" on what Lovecraft means: you wouldn't get anything even close to this particular reading, with its monster and spell taxonomies and sanity hitpoints, without the D&amp;D background and the ultimate insistense that we are going to deal with this imaginary matter via a bunch of player characters who, surprise of surprises, form a team bend on problem-solving. That generational spaceship game (Metamorphosis Alpha was the name?) is another simply delightful example of how far D&amp;D can be twisted. Really interesting products from a way of thinking that insists on evolutionary thought more than analytical and experimental.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

I guess I shouldn't have used the phrase "do one thing well".  I wasn't talking about fictional content, I was talking about point-of-play coherence.  The OSR (or at least the chunk I know) is perhaps the <i>epitome</i> of what I meant by "doing one thing well".<br/><br/>The opposite is shown in this thread: we can disagree over whether the fundamental, basic reason to play Call of Cthulhu is to experience horror or to strive to solve problems.  When groups pick one or the other, sometimes it's awesome.  When groups fail to cohere, it's usually awful.<br/><br/>What I meant by "do one thing" is "foster coherence".<br/><br/>Fostering coherence strikes me as an obvious good idea, and I wonder whether

There's no clearer example of that than "What do you do?  Be sure it's something awesome!"  <br/><br/>If you can agree on what's awesome without any help from the game, then yep, the concerns I'm raising are irrelevant to your group.  <br/><br/>But if you need help to agree on what's awesome, and the game doesn't give it to you -- that's the problem I'm talking about.  It's cool that you don't suffer from that, but I get the impression that many, many CoC groups do, so that's where I'm coming from with my critical thoughts.<br/><br/>I've never listened to a Yog-Sothoth AP podcast.  Can you link or suggest any specific ones for me to check out, that show the dynamic you're talking about?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Taking two players who are interested in totally different things and making them either:<br/><br/>-build off each other<br/>-play roles in the group such that each gets to do what s/he wants simultaneously without needing approval/notice/attention/feedback from the player to his or her right yet it's fun, or<br/>-doing things with the GM's part of the game that gets them to move closer together or to focus on some whole other thing<br/><br/>...is a GM skill.</blockquote>In my experience, the results of the latter two techniques have been underwhelming.  But maybe you're better at it than anyone I've seen.  I dunno.

I admit that I'm sort of academically curious about whether he's ever encountered genuine creative agenda clash in roleplaying, but I also recognize that it's nearly entirely futile to armchair-analyze other people's experiences on this level. The best we've ever been able to do is to provide each other with theoretical models that everybody's able to apply to their own experiences, and then they either fit or not.<br/><br/>I should note that when I try to have players with incompatible agendas build off each other, the results are usually either somewhat lame or can even approach bullying from individual player viewpoints. I've seen others describe similar experiences. There are just so many things that can go wrong. This is not an universal phenomenon, though, as I've sometimes managed to ride such agenda disagreements to keep a game functioning.<br/><br/>A prominent example of success with Zak's method that occurs to me from when we were playing D&amp;D three-ish years back with the local teenagers: a certain larper with a penchant for dramatic character roleplaying participated in the session with a fantastic character (she wanted to play a half-demon), and approached the entire exercise sort of as a dramatic platform for showing off her character's fictional background. (Obviously not quite on-message for the sort of hardcore challenge-focused OSR D&amp;D I've been running lately, but she's one of those gamers who aren't very focused on picking up instruction on how to play a specific game - she just comes to <i>play</i>.) The way her play interacted with the D&amp;D methodology (very hands-off about character actions, as we know, and realistic about consequences) ended up with her half-demon character positioned first as a sort of native guide to the rest of the party, and then as an antagonist trapmaster of the dungeon. I peg this as a genuine agenda conflict, as this one player was clearly not on-board any sort of challenge; she just na\xefvely expected that I'd keep her character out of trouble, kept establishing her own creative fantasy backstory, and clearly enjoyed outrageous events and showing off how cool her character was. I didn't stop these events even when she betrayed the rest of the party - mostly this was because I was uncertain about whether I should interfere just because of an agenda clash when the events themselves were kosher. As I continued running the game neutrally as a referee, the other players rerouted their own play and integrated the antics of this one player as part of the challenge their characters were facing.<br/><br/>In hindsight that particular session of D&amp;D was formally functional and the events were interesting in the sense that a lot happened and it had impact in the campaign and did much to generate fiction, but I do remember a certain sense of confusion from the group. I <i>think</i> that on average we felt that the events of the session were interesting and complex, but also the session was not satisfying in the way a well-executed and more purposeful dungeon delve could be. There was palpable social tension in the air during play, as the other players had to deal with the dawning realization that this one player's not on with the plan. (No doubt this was doubly complex for the teenagers playing - she was I think one player's girlfriend at the time, and used to be with another's brother; something like that, don't bite my head off if you're reading and know who I'm talking about.) I think that I incorporated the players' creative disagreement as perfectly as Zak could hope for, though, and I can sort of see that if a group were able to do this all the time then maybe play could be accomplished. As David mentioned, though, I would suspect that the overall sentiment of play would not be as satisfying, as the players wouldn't feel as safe with each other. Nowadays I'm no longer satisfied with merely fictionally eventful play, I also want to be able to look the other players in the eye and acknowledge what they're doing with appreciation.<br/><br/>I could describe a few times when I've tried to do this stuff and it has not worked as well as above. The most common outcome is just that the session becomes pretty dull. This can go any which way: a narrativist session can get fucked up when a drama-blind player refuses to have his character give in in the face of immense resistance, for example, which can be dull for the other players if we end up spending most of the session dealing with this one crazy character whose player shows no commitment nor caring about his character's fate. (At the end the character always dies off in a meaningless way, accomplishing nothing; the player just makes a new one, ready to do it all over again.) The worst case of my trying to build on agenda conflict ended with a player walking out on the campaign: he did not appreciate it when he set his trust on me as the GM, and I ruthlessly killed off his beloved character because I was totally doing high-stakes gamism at the time.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I've seen gamers who appreciate a really heavy immersion and a sort of denial of out-of-game issues use the specific technique of building off disagreement a lot: if somebody is tired and off in their game, for example, you don't say so, but rather just pretend that <i>their character</i> is similarly off. You sort of bring all the little problems and all into the game, and try to defuse/ignore them that way. You can recognize this mindset from how the GM will try to treat any dissatisfaction by asking you about what sort of content you'd rather have in the game - he thinks that you can fix players not seeing eye to eye about play with different types of orcs or whatever. I don't think that this is a very functional idea, despite the fact that I used to play this way myself for a decade. The level of play is simply so much better if you can speak directly to your co-players instead of doing this hypercorrect thing where everybody focuses on the fiction directly and never comments on its quality or how they perceive the proceedings of play.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm willing to believe that there are different experiences, but my own attempts at salvaging play by playing creative agendas off each other have often felt like playing with fire. Even when it succeeds I'm just happy that it didn't blow up in my face. I'm sure that if you know your group well and you're committed to playing together and don't have any strong ideas about what roleplaying is like, then it's easier - the players will adapt better to each other, and perhaps the emotional stakes are not as high.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367040/#Comment_367040" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T22:33:30+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 10:36PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite> I'm sure that if you know your group well and you're committed to playing together and don't have any strong ideas about what roleplaying is like, then it's easier - the players will adapt better to each other, and perhaps the emotional stakes are not as high.</blockquote>\nThis is the basic assumption of every nonCon game I've ever played and all of the best games I've played. I find it totally plausible that this is an assumption the CoC authors shared. Even more now in the 6th edition than when it was first written in the post-wargame days. (Though in the Con setting with CoC you can assume a lot and generate coherence fast: "We got 2 hours, you're investigating a haunted house today--deal or leave.")<br/><br/>The idea that Con/stranger play is the standard to be designed for seems odd to me. Though since S-G as a community is very interested in building brand new games and getting them out to the public the idea of playing with strangers as a standard to meet may be a conscious or unconscious assumption.<br/><br/>I think many of the flaws you're seeing would usually only emerge with people you didn't know well. Like your "immortal demon LARPer" would have been chilled out and integrated way faster if she knew all the people socially well and had a circuit with them.<br/><br/>Like you build a car different if you assume it's mostly for demolition derby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367043/#Comment_367043" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T22:48:24+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:48PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely, the situations are different all around. As we've discussed lately here at Story Games, the choices we make as hobbyists regarding the openness of our groups, the amount of outreach we do and so on will have a powerful impact on the creative profile of what you do. I personally enjoy meeting new gamers, and have sort of grown used to constant recruitment, even if the core of the group tends to remain the same. I practiced roleplaying in this way in Helsinki ten years back, and I'm doing it this way up here as well. One of the best parts about this long-running D&amp;D campaign we've been doing is actually that it's so optimally suited for introducing new players: no hard limits on number of players, no need for consistent participation, easy to get into the game, and the game shows its true colors over one session in three sessions out of four.<br/><br/>(When I'm not doing D&amp;D our recruitment drive is not nearly as aggressive as it is right now, but it's still going on all the time. When we get new people, we often specifically choose a robust game that they might like as an introduction game to let people get to know each other.)<br/><br/>Thinking about it, it would be sort of sweet to have that consistent and successful background as a say Call of Cthulhu stylist. I can imagine how a master of the form is in peace with himself and the game, knowing exactly what it can accomplish. Ability to see the world around you as fodder for and in terms of the game. Probably very similar to my own mastering of <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, in fact. A long-term Keeper of such a game will indeed not need or want another game, and he won't care particularly about the concerns of us ordinary folks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367044/#Comment_367044" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T22:51:25+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're doing great at the "untouchably strange paragraphs" thing tonight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367045/#Comment_367045" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T23:01:53+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:01PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

And then we all laugh, "Man, that was a cool, crazy game!" <br/><br/>However, <b>in my experience</b>, it was fun but it wasn't The Big Fun. It was often un-fun (as Dave describes). It was occasionally fun on the surface, but feeling pretty shaky (as Eero describes). It was also often workable and fun but <i>only if</i> the GM (usually it was the GM) put in a ton of work to tie the loose ends together. With a skilled and talented GM, that was fun: s/he asked how the mystery-lover was reacting to the crazy character, and back, until the whole worked together in a sensible way, so these two different things just gave the game a sense of variety. But, boy, it was exhausting to be that GM! (Over the long term, especially.)<br/><br/>In my experience, playing games since then with certain people (I can't say for sure that it was the games, mind, but I suspect they played a role) which allowed a really strong focus on <i>what this game is about</i>, has blown that kind of gaming out of the water completely. It's partially what Eero describes:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Nowadays I'm no longer satisfied with merely fictionally eventful play, I also want to be able to look the other players in the eye and acknowledge what they're doing with appreciation.</blockquote>\nAnd it's partially just how *easy* playing in that mode feels. It can be intense and awesome without anyone feeling like they have to work hard to get it. When everyone is engaged in the same game for the same reasons, when each player knows exactly what kind of contribution will take the game further, and the others react in kind, it just kind of moves along effortlessly. It's not herding cats, it's smooth and powerful movement forward as a unit.<br/><br/>Edit: Kind of like the example of the guy who is going crazy next to the chick who is trying to solve the mystery. The game can work if the GM keeps tying that together in clever ways, sure. But it's way easier to play when they're both really into the tension they're creating by doing that and playing off of each other. The GM doesn't have to say, "Hey, mystery-girl: the crazy dude is messing up your concentration. How are you going to collect clues now?" Instead, her player does that, and is totally into it, while the guy-going-crazy is winking at her, because this is exactly the sort of thing they were hoping they might have to deal with.<br/><br/>(Of course, maybe it's a coincidence that I played in a lot of games like that--the less focused kind--when I was younger, and more focused games lately, with better tools. I can't say for sure. This is just my impression, the conclusion I've come to myself.)<br/><br/>So that's me. Maybe I just haven't seen it all proper-like! I'm open to that possibility. But if that is the case, I don't know how to try it out. I need some kind of text/teacher!<br/><br/>Zak, I'm very curious what that sounds like to you. Does it sound all pretentious? Misguided? Does it make it sounds like maybe I'm dissing your gaming in some roundabout way?<br/><br/>I'm just trying to report my own experiences for the sake of discussion, and I hope that's the spirit in which this will be taken. My experience is far more limited than most of you (I don't game anywhere near as much as Zak or Eero, for instance), so I'm open to my point of view being handicapped by a limited sample.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367385/#Comment_367385" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T01:56:40+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  1:56AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 2:12AM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, all that is academic.

Certainly it's pretty well established that either it wouldn't be worth the trouble or it would be impossible to exhaustively analyze why and how people appreciate other arts. No reason for roleplaying to be different. (Of course, despite the difficulty of exhaustive answers, artists do routinely engage in artistic programs that strive to capture at least part of the matter with some sort of "rules" or heuristics. So it's not like the impossibility of understanding the aesthetic moment would prevent artistic analysis.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367401/#Comment_367401" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T02:39:51+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  2:39AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>In the meantime, a follow-up question: do you think that it's possible to finangle any more detail out of the aesthetic nexus that is the gaming session, or are we doomed to treat the entire thing essentially as a black box?

The critical lit on books, ditto, paintings, etc<br/><br/>The critical lit on games is based on hearsay (not great), AP reports (only slightly better), books (a separate but related issue), and more recently: videos massively edited to serve as entertainment (like our show--ok but not totally revealing of the whole story by any means) and, finally, a few actual play sessions recorded in their entirety (now<i> that</i> is what we need).<br/><br/>Five people who played in a session can fruitfully talk about what made a session work (or not) very easily. People who weren't there--especially ones with hardened ideas about what makes a game good--not so much.<br/><br/>The best way to get scientific about it is record entire play session all the way through and analyze those. Or just show up and play the game.<br/><br/>We have the technology to do it now, supercheap. All you need is a web connection.

Using actual play audio to examine game play more closely is something that has great value for anyone who's interested in the table-level dynamics of play. I think Mel and I are groping toward some kind of critical program, but the act of reflecting on play by paying attention to interesting moments in the game (whether at the level of the fiction or of the social-level interaction) actually <i>changes the experience of the game</i> to a great degree. In my scholarly work, which uses actual play audio as empirical data, I've taken to quoting the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, who hints at the character of that change. Here's an excerpt from a thing I wrote for Jonathan Walton's <i>Magic Missile</i> anthology:\n<blockquote>Bakhtin notes that, to the players themselves, \u201cplaying . . . does not presuppose any spectator (situated outside their playing) for whom the whole of the event of a life imaged [i.e., represented] through play would actually be performed\u201d (p. 74). Play imagines rather than images, he says, such that \u201cthe boy who plays a robber chieftain experiences his own [imagined] life . . . from within himself. . . . The relationship of each of the players to the event of life they have decided to enact . . . is no more than the desire to take part in that event, to experience that life as one of its participants\u201d (p. 74). A transformation takes place once an audience is present, however. The spectator is able to appreciate the children\u2019s play  as a whole rather than as the individuated experience that they perceive. \u201cIn doing so,\u201d Bakhtin goes on, the spectator \u201calters the event as it is initially given: the event becomes enriched with a new moment, new in principle\u2014an author/beholder, and, as a result, all other moments of the event are transformed as well, inasmuch as they become part of the new whole\u201d (p. 75). This new thing is \u201cno longer the event of playing, but the artistic event of drama in its embryonic form\u201d (p. 75). </blockquote>\nThe idea that AP transforms the ephemeral "text" of the game in play into a performance that can then be reflected upon is really interesting to me; I'm working on a paper about it now. What I think (or maybe just hope) is beginning to happen in the indie-games community is an extension of how the Forge used written AP reports to diagnose incoherent play to an "audio AP culture" where interesting moments of play are explored in reflection after the game. So--to tie this back to Cthulhu--Mel and I talk in an upcoming episode about the <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> scenario I ran at Dreamation, <b>Castle Bravo</b>, which I thought was the best game I ever ran, period, but Mel found himself a little dissatisfied with his personal experience as a player even while enjoying the fiction that was created. Trying to grapple with that disconnect made for an interesting conversation, and I hope it will be up soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367613/#Comment_367613" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T13:32:22+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  1:32PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 1:32PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Mel and I talk in an upcoming episode about the<i>Trail of Cthulhu</i>scenario I ran at Dreamation,<b>Castle Bravo</b>, which I thought was the best game I ever ran, period, but Mel found himself a little dissatisfied with his personal experience as a player even while enjoying the fiction that was created.

Mel sums up our discussion, and backs it up with AP audio from the game.<br/>.\n<blockquote><cite>Mel White at Virtual Play says</cite>Hi!  Today\u2019s episode is the next in the Dreamation Recap series. This show is about Bill\u2019s Trail of Cthulhu adventure, Castle Bravo.  He ran it for us at Dreamation.  Along with me, the players were Dave Petroski, Larry Wickman, Dave Cole, Joe, and Marcus. This was an interesting show to discuss.  As we talk about in the audio, Bill did a great job running it, and it was very entertaining.  What was lacking for me, though, was a sense of impacting the story\u2013although that perspective may be unique to me.  In retrospect, it\u2019s clear that the actions of the player characters did matter.  In our game, the action was driven by the characters of Chief Walton and Lt Davis, played by Larry and Dave C., respectively.  The realization I have coming away from this game is that maybe I should not be trying to drive the adventure in a ToC game.  Instead, I should be (or could be) portraying the reactions of my character to the madness that is being revealed.  The Gumshoe system ensures the player characters are going to get the clues\u2013all we have to do as players is react.  In any event, the game was fantastic fun and I look forward to any comments from people who have played Castle Bravo, either at Dreamation or elsewhere\u2013elsewhen!\u2013or comments on ToC in general.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368199/#Comment_368199" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T21:44:40+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  9:44PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is Seaman Bodine a Thomas Pynchon reference?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368202/#Comment_368202" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T22:05:10+00:00" title="March 16, 2012 10:05PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 11:06PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I am listening to the podcast (I'm at 17:52) and it is basically all about the discussion we just had so far:<br/><br/>One player is saying "Well I was trying to investigate and that's not what you're supposed to do, I should've relaxed and tried to just experience the horror and gotten into my character"<br/><br/>And (still only 17 mins in, so maybe I haven't heard this bit) I'd say that's more the GM's fault for not realizing/noticing that you had a frustrated problem solver at the table and either saying (to him) "Hey, this game is going elsewhere, hop on board" or  (to himself):"Ok, what can I do with this scenario to use this person's attempts to understand to help drive the game forward"?<br/><br/>Now maybe in later more specialized designs you don't have to do that because everyone coming in is already on the same page, but I think <i>always</i> doing that in every game means you miss out on the richness and complexity made possible by having competing drives at the table.<br/><br/>Question: Is it possible that the player's unconscious assumption, upon stumbling upon <i>a </i>way to play the game, was that<i> if it was possible to play the game a certain way</i> (after all, there are all these investigative tools built in) then that must be the "right" way to play? And, if so, does this kind of assumption stem from having played so many hyperfocused games? (I don't know the players' history)<br/><br/>Because some games are very up front about how different various playniches are: like the thief in a pre-4e D&amp;D game literally has to play a whole different style of game than the fighter.

The best advice that would have helped me would have been, 'As your character, do your job.'  This is the approach I'll take in future ToC adventures.  It may be applicable to CoC...In the Castle Bravo adventure, ironically the characters who drove the story were the ones doing their job, as opposed to the ones (me, mainly) thinking we had to solve the mystery.  So the pilot flew--and found the geologic anomaly; the security chief 'secured' and confronted Sawyer, etc.  For the chaplain, my character, doing my job would have been ministering to the sailors, perhaps seeking to do something humanitarian for the islanders displaced by the atomic tests, counseling the other PCs, etc.  And that, as we discuss in the show, would have been cool and interesting depending on how the chaplain interpreted the weirdness going on aboard USS BIROKO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageCole" title="SavageCole"><img alt="SavageCole" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageCole">SavageCole</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368225/#Comment_368225" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T07:31:24+00:00" title="March 17, 2012  7:31AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The group dynamics of our session group fascinate me.  A few leap out at me as having a major influence in Mel's experience.<br/>\n<br/>\na.  Mel's being Bill's brother.  Does familiarity influence the way Bill interacts as a GM with Mel the player, and vice-a-versa?  For example, did their history and relationship help form Mel's perception of the game as a solve-it vs. play-it game?  Seeing so many siblings, spouses, close friends, the role that pre-existing relationships play in the way a table interacts and a story plays out is inevitable. <br/>\n<br/>\nb.  Seating.  I know it sounds silly, but Mel sat immediately to Bill's left and it would have been more difficult for Bill to see Mel's expression than the other half-dozen players facing Bill.  This sounds ridiculous, but I think seating arrangement is a major factor in how tabletop gamers relate with each other and their GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nc.  Con setting.  Unfamiliar players jumping into a one-off might be more willing to let go and take a ride.  A noisy con environment might not lend itself especially well to deeper investigation.

But in reality, the mystery was being solved all the time--the Sawyer character and other NPCs were chock full of information on what was happening.  We just had to listen.  But listen or not, the things that were going to happen, were going to happen!  And, as Bill mentions in our discussion, there were lots of points in the game where PC decisions determined the course of the adventure--certainly the pacing at least--Lt Davis' recon led to the island Rongirik, we decided on our own to investigate the volcano, and most tellingly, Chief Walton on his own initiative secured a pistol and later shot Sawyer in the head with it!  So, by 'my job' I meant, of course, the PC's job.  My dissatisfaction stems not so much from how the adventure played out, but from what I felt was an ineffective role and probably also from my lack of any real handle on playing the chaplain as a chaplain--rather than as an investigator.  To paraphrase what they say in the Marines, if someone accused Mullaney of being a chaplain, would there be enough evidence from that game to convict him?  Maybe., but the answer should be 'yes'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368244/#Comment_368244" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T10:46:10+00:00" title="March 17, 2012 10:46AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If that's how you want to play him, cool beans.<br/><br/>But I think a good Cthulhu scenario should be built to have a role for <i>any</i> player to decide to investigate stuff and thereby change the tenor of later events in a nontrivial way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageCole" title="SavageCole"><img alt="SavageCole" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageCole">SavageCole</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368317/#Comment_368317" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T07:28:38+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  7:28AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With do respect, Father Mullaney played a central role in how events unfolded.

As I recall, Eero is right; you're told that you're supposed to design the game as an onion, with layers of mystery one on top of the other that you have to peel away in order to learn the deeper truths of the Mythos. The implication is that, by the time you're at the core, you may very well have left a trail of dead or insane investigators behind you, and maybe missed some clues or signs that would guide you to uncovering the optimal defenses against the Mythos. While evocative of Lovecraftian cosmic bleakness, that may not always lead to scintillating play.<br/><br/>Zak's point, if I read him right, is that, well, people can just sort of figure it out, and you don't need "textual support" to figure out what works for you. That's fine, but unless you plan on only playing one game ever (which admittedly many folks do in fact plan to do) there's a lot of benefit to being able to read a set of rules that presents procedures designed to create a specific experience without <i>reading your own assumptions about game-running</i> into the rules in a way that makes it impossible for you to create that experience. Briefer: sometimes we could all use a little help; that's what we're paying our game designers for.<br/><br/>So <b>Trail of Cthulhu</b>, trying to solve a specific kind of problem that sometimes afflicts investigative games, imagines each adventure as a trail of clues that leads ultimately to a big reveal--which you may or may not be equipped to deal with, depending on how well you were able to manage your investigative spends and general skill use (i.e., manage your resources and be clever). The way I've learned to run Trail of Cthulhu is not to offer a breadcrumb trail that you follow but a firehose spray that you try not to drown in. So it's not a railroad; PC choices matter <i>immensely</i> in shaping what happens, and a player's ability to make sense of the welter of information he or she is receiving contributes to the success or failure of the investigation. In this case, while I think the players were just about there in figuring out what was going on and how to "solve" their problems, they ran out of time and the adventure ended in a climactic showdown that drove the PCs more or less satisfyingly around the bend. That was me flexing my GM muscles, of course--call it Force if you must--but the players' choices put them there. Nonetheless, the larger point is that I'm using the "textual support" offered by <b>Trail of Cthulhu</b> to design, structure, and run the adventure, adapting it in light of my own preferences and experiences.<br/><br/>And it's not just GMs who might want a little help in figuring out how to make a game do what they want! Mel's point about practice being a good thing in terms of learning how to play role-playing games is well-taken, and not (or not just) for the sake of system mastery. For example, all that impro stuff about "Yes, and..." and avoiding blocking is important to remember. In listening to the AP audio from the podcast, there was this point where his Father Mullaney says to Cole's Lt. Davis the pilot in reply to his request for guidance, "Let's just pray and it'll all work itself out," or something like that. If I take Mel's comments accurately, he's saying that he wishes that, at that moment, he'd done something to work with Cole's offer in a way that both <i>revealed character</i> and <i>drove play</i>. Which is a good thing to take away from reviewing your own AP audio, and trying to achieve such insights is the entire raison d'etre behind <b>Virtual Play</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368398/#Comment_368398" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T19:46:53+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  7:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that makes sense, I just think, in the most perfect excellent Platonic of all possible GMing days (which are rare for everybody) the GM might've noticed that the good Father was headed down a path that lead to a less-than-satisfying path for his player and tried to find some way--in-world or out--to deal with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368402/#Comment_368402" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T20:33:31+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  8:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>I think that makes sense, I just think, in the most perfect excellent Platonic of all possible GMing days (which are rare for everybody) the GM might've noticed that the good Father was headed down a path that lead to a less-than-satisfying path for his player and tried to find some way--in-world or out--to deal with that.</blockquote>\nOh sure.

I played two ToC adventures with my weekly group, The Black Drop and The Dying of St Margaret's.  <br/><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/82105/Trail-of-Cthulhu%3A-The-Black-Drop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/82105/Trail-of-Cthulhu:-The-Black-Drop</a>?<br/><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/61146/Trail-of-Cthulhu%3A-The-Dying-of-St-Margaret%27s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/61146/Trail-of-Cthulhu:-The-Dying-of-St-Margaret's</a>?<br/><br/>We then decided we liked Cthulhu, but switched over to Call of Cthulhu instead - and we played out The Madman and are now in Shadows of Yog-Sothoth.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>To connect this back to the OP, Eero was saying that the text of CoC doesn't provide a lot of support for the "monsters jump out at you--deal!" school of adventure design.

I feel like both of these apply equally to the Call of Cthulhu and Trail of Cthulhu adventures we've done.  While the mechanics of spending differed, I didn't feel like it changed the overall structure very much.  In both cases, there are a bunch of clues we got, and a bunch of clues we missed.  We eventually succeeded in figuring out where to go for the climax - but we never had the sense that we understood things all that well or were in control, as is appropriate for a horror game.  Our choices mattered, but there were also important random and/or arbitrary effects on how things went as well - which contributed to the horror.  <br/><br/>For me and my group, the choice to switch over to Call of Cthulhu wasn't so much over the larger structure of adventures, but rather over how smooth and satisfying the moment-to-moment mechanics felt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368486/#Comment_368486" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T11:56:46+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 11:56AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>For me and my group, the choice to switch over to Call of Cthulhu wasn't so much over the larger structure of adventures, but rather over how smooth and satisfying the moment-to-moment mechanics felt.</blockquote>\nThis underscores a point that is worth making: if your group has already established a procedure that produces a more-or-less satisfying structure of play for investigations, <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> may seem a little underwhelming; it's a solution to a problem you don't have.

You can see this more prominently in the Dying Earth/Skulduggery game, where I think the design logic reaches its fullest expression, but ToC's extended contests work similarly: you roll until somebody fails, with each roll representing an opportunity to maintain your lead against a pursuer, e.g., or stumble and get caught. Unlike CoC, though, the probability of any given roll being upbeat or downbeat ;-) is not closely connected to your skill rating. Instead, you have to decide to spend from your pool to raise your chance of success; otherwise it's a 50/50 shot. So the probabilities of success or failure map onto dramatic considerations rather than in-game ones.\n<blockquote>Separately, as long as we're talking AP of your ToC games, I have a very nit-picky observation from our Big Hoodoo game at Nerdly last year.

Running a "real" ToC game is certainly on our future agenda as it's a great system. Taking a page from ToC, I simply presented the clues to the players sans rolls if they possessed percentiles in the appropriate skills; if they wanted a "spend" they might (or might not) need to actually roll for it.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368551/#Comment_368551" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T18:46:42+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  6:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>ToC's extended contests work similarly: you roll until somebody fails, with each roll representing an opportunity to maintain your lead against a pursuer, e.g., or stumble and get caught.</blockquote>That makes perfect sense in terms of the "beat" analogy, but I sure don't remember play unfolding like that any of the times I've played ToC.

Dick), and Parke (Ginny Heinlein).</b>  Mostly what I did during this game was talk to NPCs in an effort to get info out of them, propose theories to the other PCs about what might be going on, and propose what we ought to do next.  I quite like doing all of these things, and the game was overall a good time.<br/><br/>However, I felt somewhat disoriented about how to play.  What should I or could I do that would matter to the group?  Here's a breakdown:<br/><br/><b>What to do next:</b><br/>Don adopted the most forceful character persona, and got the final word on most of the "what should we do?" disagreements.  I churned out the most proposals, and the group was happy to follow some of them.  Seraphina and Parke each had one or two really good proposals that we went with, but otherwise seemed content to move forward in any direction.  "What should we do next?" is a mixed bag in most games, with some players enjoying a drawn-out process and others hating it.  In games where it's assumed that this is a weighty and consequential decision, where choosing wisely yields immense rewards, I've seen this turn into a focal point of play, for good ("Yes!  Brilliant idea!") and bad ("None of these are good enough, we must keep thinking.").  This was not at all the case in our Big Hoodoo game.  When I came up with some exciting theory and clever plan of action, the group met it with the same, "Okay, sure," response as when I simply proposed the obvious next step.<br/><br/><b>Theories:</b><br/>I don't recall a lot of interest, either from Bill or the other players, in carving out scenes for the characters to form theories.  Mostly, the characters kept busy doing stuff, and Bill kept up the action by pushing to get to the next thing.  Overall, a good technique in a late-night one-shot con session with a time cap; you don't want to lose the energy, slow progress, and not get to the end.  However, the result was that my curiosity didn't get much chance to gestate.  Doing the whole, "Hey, maybe this mystery is about <i>this</i>, what do y'all think?" phase makes me much more excited to pursue the mystery.  Each new development can help confirm or refute theories.  Without the chance to process each discovery, and fit it into the puzzle, the impression is more of trivia.  "Okay, the dead guy liked rockets.  Moving on..."  I managed to work some theorizing into the flow of NPC interactions, and I think Seraphina enjoyed some of my idea-spouting, and Don and Parke might have occasionally raised an eyebrow in interest, but that was about it.<br/><br/><b>Efforts and problem-solving:</b><br/>As opposed to theorizing and planning, the group seemed more intent on navigating the immediate situation in front of us.  This generally meant talking to some NPCs who had help to give but reservations to overcome.  I tried to roleplay in a sympathetic manner to elicit NPCs to confide, while everyone else simultaneously did whatever they thought would get the NPC to spill the beans.  Whenever someone delivered a good bit of dialogue, and Bill coughed up the clues, that was a good moment that I felt everyone cared about.  Nothing wrong with that.  However, with 4 players all attempting one task, the odds of return on investment were pretty low.  I think the less quick and assertive players in the group didn't get a whole lot of these types of achievements.<br/><br/>"How to talk to this NPC" wasn't the only type of success-relevant decision.  There was an occasional roll to know something or shoot a gun or whatnot.  I don't remember anyone at the table looking over their character sheets for high scores and trying to steer the fiction into using those, though.  They were a relative side note.  <br/><br/>As far as I could tell, the formula for character success was "chat with NPC, then choose where to go and what to do next", with the group's focus on the "chat with NPC" part.<br/><br/><b>Portrayal:</b><br/>I don't think the players in our group were history buffs.  I don't know anything about Boucher or Heinlein or Dick's lives.  The character sheets gave us some basic areas of interest, and we all worked these into the roleplay reasonably well, but definitely as side notes.  I would have happily followed the group into a "What does this mean to my guy?" style of play, but there was absolutely nothing going on at the table in that direction.  Like most Lovecraft stories and Cthulhu scenarios, the majority of the adventure didn't have anything sanity-taxing in it.  The emotions evoked were those present in any suspense story: "There's danger out there and maybe we should be nervous and hurry."  The scenario gave us reasons to worry, and we acted on those like responsible problem-solvers: we took precautions, we didn't waste much time, and we tried to get to the bottom of things before it was too late.  This may, in fact, account for the disinclination to spend too long on theories or plans.<br/><br/>My point here is that "there's danger out there, let's be nervous and hurry" is not the most captivating thing to roleplay, or to see roleplayed.  Portrayal of character emotions never became "the thing to do that matters".<br/><br/>It seemed like this could have changed when some weird stuff happened to Dick, and Seraphina did a nice job with it, engaging the other characters to show concern.  But that turned out to be an exception; it was quickly "back to the mission".<br/><br/>Portrayal simply didn't seem to be a group priority; Bill handed me a sweet demonic monologue, which I belted out with gusto, and no one seemed particularly psyched.<br/><br/><b>The GM:</b><br/>I would characterize Bill as a rather "hands on" GM.  He doesn't micromanage people's character play, but he frames and cuts scenes and interactions where he feels they should be framed and cut, and directs the players' attention where he feels it belongs.  Whether this was relevant for this group, I don't know, but I've seen the same approach lead to player passivity and "looking to the GM to model how to play" in other games.  I did not feel that Bill modeled a specific way to play in this instance, meeting most types of player contribution with equal degrees of validation.<br/><br/><b>Overall:</b><br/>The plot was excellent, the discoveries were cool, invoking a ghost made for a fantastic scene, and stopping the badguys at the end was satisfying even if I was fuzzy on how we earned it (was it luck? my brilliance? Parke's? Bill being nice?  who knows!).  I enjoyed being there and seeing what happened.  But I never got a sense of how to contribute in a way that anyone else would value.  Theories?  No.  Plans?  Not really.  Dialogue with NPCs?  Yes, but there's only so much to go around.  Roleplaying character stress?  Probably not.  Roleplaying character madness?  Not applicable.<br/><br/>Please don't take this long post as an assertion on my part that any specific thing <i>should</i> have happened.  I raise it mainly for Bill's consideration as a GM and scenario designer.

I know that I do things in a 4-hour con slot to keep things moving, but it sounds to me like you had an experience that was the opposite of Mel's: he wished he had contributed more awesome stuff as his character; you wish that the awesomeness you did contribute in character was acknowledged by the people at the table.

It seems to me that your dissatisfaction lies in the fact that the RPing, such as it was, was mainly instrumental--in the service of the clue-finding, procedural side of things, that is--instead of being dramatic or in the service of revealing character or requiring in-character decision-making.

And that other people's contributions seemed to meet with indifference* too.  The rest of my account is just observations about factors that <i>might</i> have contributed.  I don't really have a confident takeaway.<br/><br/>My best <i>guess</i> would be that the indifference* stemmed from a lack of clarity on the players' responsibilities, goals, and priorities in the activity.  If I'm instinctively groping my way through a blend of theorizing, planning, puzzling, and portrayal, and the guy next to me is doing the same, it's hard for either of us to recognize moments of "doing it right" in a game where there isn't a ton of table-talk.<br/><br/>If it had been clear to everyone that the purpose of play was to roleplay your way into finding clues, and there had been a way for everyone to get in on that action, I imagine the positive social feedback would have been much more frequent.  We'd know what we were all collaborating on, and would be able to measure and appreciate each other's contributions accordingly.<br/><br/>Or perhaps there's something inherently tricky about sticking four characters in a loose alliance and asking them to cleverly chat their way into discovery.  I dunno.  When I run Delve, there's a decent amount of pumping NPCs for clues, and I'm happy with how it plays out, but the context is extremely different.<br/><br/>Finally, although I wasn't <i>trying</i> to make the point "Dave doesn't like RP that's mainly instrumental", you are in fact correct that I generally dig drama, revealing character, and in-character decision-making.  And I tend to expect it at con games with story gamers.  And I like it in Cthulhu.  So maybe I'm bringing substantial bias into this.<br/><br/>*"Indifference" may sound a little stronger than I mean it to.  I'm not talking about anything seriously bad.  Hopefully my previous posts described it better.

Without those, people often have trouble with a game.  Basically, suppose someone doesn't know about RPGs - say like the teenage child of an old friend or cousin of mine.  I wouldn't feel confident that I could just mail them a copy of an RPG text with a note saying "play this" and be confident that they'll get good play without frustrations.  <br/><br/>However, I feel that's just as true of The Mountain Witch, Mouse Guard, or Dresden Files as it is of Call of Cthulhu.  I'd say that among the best for just mailing would be some of the D&amp;D Basic Sets - though those still have issues.  In my opinion, Call of Cthulhu is definitely more difficult than that, but still probably above average for RPGs of any style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368986/#Comment_368986" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T11:48:38+00:00" title="March 23, 2012 11:48AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite><cite>Posted By: Heikki Hallamaa</cite>I'd assume that people who continue playing CoC are the ones who didn't get frustrated with it.

Merely about the factual history of what typically happens when people play this game.<br/><br/>Now maybe RPGs as a whole are frustrating, or (more likely) RPGs that cast a wide net risk frustrating people (in exchange for the reward of great flexibility) more than narrow-focused RPGs, but there is zero evidence that "frustration" is "typical" and much evidence that people get it, play it, and like it. <i>At least compared to other RPGs.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368994/#Comment_368994" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T13:00:14+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  1:00PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My point was that you can't use the fact that CoC <i>sells well</i> or <i>has been around a long time</i> as evidence that it <i>works well</i> (i.e., is "high quality"), which is what you seem to be arguing. If you're not disputing that, fine. If you say frustration is an atypical result of attempts to play CoC rather than a typical one, I'm prepared to believe you--but how well CoC sells or how long it has stayed the way it is are not evidence I'm prepared to accept in support of that position. Another reason for its longevity, in addition to bandwagon effects deriving from its early arrival on the scene, may have to do with the popularity of its Lovecraftian source material, which for a long period it was the only authorized purveyor. Now that Lovecraft is in the public domain (or whatever the reason is for the arrival of new Cthulhu game systems), that intellectual property monopoly may matter less.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368996/#Comment_368996" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T13:33:03+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  1:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think that Zak isn't talking solely about sales numbers.

However, we have plenty of other evidence, because Call of Cthulhu is often played in personal groups, discussed in online and live communities, run at conventions, recommended by other game designers, and so forth.  <br/><br/>In addition to this, we have some conflicting anecdotes here.  That is, some people said they played Call of Cthulhu by the book and found it difficult to have fun compared to other RPGs, while other people have played it and found it relatively easy to have fun.  <br/><br/>I think the combination of the conflicting anecdotes and the extensive other evidence suggests to me that Call of Cthulhu is a relatively easy game to get into, but that it isn't to everyone's taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369002/#Comment_369002" name="Item_198" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T14:51:53+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  2:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2012 3:02PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe someone should do a poll on RPGnet?<br/><br/>What would the right question be?<br/><br/>"The first time you played Call of Cthulhu, was it more fun or more frustrating?" perhaps?  <br/><br/>Though maybe "first time" should be clarified as "first adventure", not "first session", to be fair to those groups who just took 2 or 3 sessions to "get it"?<br/><br/>I think a lot of the question is about <i>level</i> of frustration.

At all. In fact I said, explicitly, that i wasn't saying that.  Whether people are happy with a game has nothing to do with whether it's good. People like Farmville. I am simply talking about<i> Is frustration typical with this game? </i> Whether the common run of people express frustration with a game has nothing to do with whether it is good.<br/><br/>A good way to judge satisfaction on the anecdotal level is how often the game is "drifted" by playgroups unofficially and/or how often the game is officially changed by the company that owns it (editions).<br/><br/>Cthulhu gets futzed with (Trail of Cthulhu addresses one kind of group's needs and removing the resistance table is another common homebrew hack) but the mismatch of Expectation v. Result that you get with Vampire, RIFTS, Shadowrun or D&amp;D? (Or WH40K? The other big name in hobby games.) No way. Those are games where people get so frustrated so often people keep changing them--publicly and privately.<br/><br/>Even the hack-happy OSR both:<br/>-loves Cthulhu and plays it frequently, and<br/>-doesn't mess with the system much<br/><br/>It's not just that Cthulhu sold well for 30 years, it that it sold well<i> as basically the exact same system</i> for 30 years. Cthulhu "editions" are so similar, systemwise, you can barely tell which one you're playing--they're just changes to the furniture in the book.<br/><br/>Anyway, according to the Law of Ludological Presumption of Innocence, it's on TomasHVM to prove "frustration" is "typical".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369024/#Comment_369024" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T16:01:43+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  4:01PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2012 4:02PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caveat:<br/><br/>If you are including the adventure modules as part of what you consider "The Game" then, yes, modules for Cthulhu usually suck in terms of construction, are railroady, and are unimaginative.

I think one of the reasons Call of Cthulhu has prospered is that its modules are less sucky than other systems.  In my experience, new GMs often go from running modules as written, to running modules with creative changes, to mining modules for ideas, to running without any published material.  <br/><br/>I think that having a base to work from can support doing anything - in the sense that a game with a bunch of modules is just as good at doing anything as a game with nothing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369031/#Comment_369031" name="Item_205" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T16:31:37+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  4:31PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Figaro</cite>Want to give a couple examples of well known CoC adventures that are railroady and how that makes those particular adventures BAD,<br/></blockquote>\nWell Horror on the Orient Express and King in Yellow (despite having some cool things in them) both have loopholes that either nullify totally reasonable interesting player choices or allow the investigators to skip some of the best and meatiest content in the module by doing unintended things and give no in-module advice about how to use that to bring the content to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369032/#Comment_369032" name="Item_206" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T16:48:05+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  4:48PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Anyway, according to the Law of Ludological Presumption of Innocence, it's on TomasHVM to prove "frustration" is "typical".</blockquote>\nThat I'll accept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369039/#Comment_369039" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T18:57:38+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  6:57PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best games of Call of Cthulhu (and also Trail), in my long experience of the game, happen when players stop worrying about the system and really connect with what's going on in the story, SIS or whatever you like to call it. This is often in an immersive way but can also be in a story way (I don't think these things are exclusive). There is always a build up of tension which ultimately is released in an heroic success or failure. The outcome is not important but the management of the process is. Some of this is about managing the mystery and revealing it slowly, some of it is that Lovecraftian thing of finding out that you are not only fucked, but that you always, and inescapably, were. How you react to this in the game, as a character, is very important for its success. Railroad is not a useful term for describing this because to a certain extent, that was the whole point of playing the game in the first place. When the tentacly god beats down on you, when you find that your skin is made of alien DNA, that the world will end when the stars are right, when dreams are more sane than reality, how do you react?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369049/#Comment_369049" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T20:40:09+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  8:40PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2012 8:43PM by JDCorley.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Well if the value system is "You can do aaaaaaanything results in paralysis" then, conversely, the modules are Great and the game itself Sucks.</blockquote>\nWhat happened to "often"?!

Whether this is indicative of anything objective.... That, I don't know.<br/>I've had good Keepers, and I don't know how much they tweaked or streamlined the rules.<br/>I've played at Origins, where the Call of Cthulhu fans, of whom I am definitely one, self select. We play together year after year, we know each other, we trust each other. This doesn't mean there are no subpar games, but my odds are good.<br/><br/>I've run a lot of Call of Cthulhu adventures, but I've only run Call of Cthulhu itself twice. The rest of the time, I adapted the content of a solid published scenario to the setting and system I was using at the time. I've been inspired by <i>Stealing Cthulhu</i> to see if I can do this with <i>Masks of Nyarlathotep</i> for <i>Kerberos Club, Fate Edition</i>.<br/><br/>I ran two published campaigns for my home group. Both went well, although I think I did a much better job on <i>Tatters of the King</i> (which I ran second) than on <i>Beyond the Mountains of Madness</i>. I did some tweaking in both cases, so while it's Call of Cthulhu, there were a couple of house rules, and where the campaigns had spots that didn't quite work (too much railroading, no obvious connection, whatever), I fixed it. What I did worked fine -- for my home group, people I know and trust, people who know and trust me.<br/><br/>I love that the rules haven't changed and that I'm buying useful content. I would say that I've bathed in the Kool-Aid.<br/><br/>I also have most of the Trail of Cthulhu products. The system doesn't quite work for me, but the content is golden.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369118/#Comment_369118" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-24T21:34:00+00:00" title="March 24, 2012  9:34PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Side note on Trail of Cthulhu: I've no beef with the investigation rules.
