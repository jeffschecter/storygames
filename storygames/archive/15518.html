We're using Mouse Guard right now to run a 1960s black ops game, and it's perfect.  MG is so hackable that I'm actually really surprised there aren't a bunch of other hacks out there, like there are with AW.

These are easy-ish as long as the core three-way tension of the game -- one's nature versus one's personal obligations versus one's group obligations -- remains intact. It's also a huge help if you can knock the Nature reskin out of the park. Folks who have tried to write a Nature (Human) have discovered just how hard this exercise can be, although a lot of headway has been made over in the Hacks forum @ BWHQ.<br/><br/>Then there's what I'm calling a reimplementation, which keeps the structure of the game -- GM and player's turns, the Nature mechanics, questionnaire-based chargen, groups receiving missions from an external authority -- but stretches the envelope in interesting ways. This type of hack is harder to pull off because it involves more original work and testing, but at the same time it really opens the game-space horizon way up. It means you can be looser about what your "group" is, what the "external authority" is, how you stage your questionnaire, and so on. <br/><br/>That first approach is great fun and I wish more people would go for it, but it is also very, very constrained. MG works for some very specific setting, aesthetic and mechanical reasons that don't necessarily translate cleanly.<br/><br/>That second approach is, I think, going to see less action but, hopefully, produce more fruit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351923/#Comment_351923" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-19T10:50:11+00:00" title="December 19, 2011 10:50AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2011 10:51AM by mease19.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thadrine</cite>I also ran a one shot using Realm Guard and it would be the system I would use for Middle Earth anymore, as long as no one wants to play a wizard.</blockquote>\nIts simple, don't allow wizards.  Middle Earth games aren't really about wizard stories, they just have wizards in them.

We originally intended it to be inspired by the John Carter of Mars novellas, with an American black ops agent fighting Soviet influence in the shining cities on the dark side of the moon.  The main protagonist was going to be a secret passenger on Apollo 8.  But we've backed up a bit and started in early March 1968, just after the Tet Offensive, when John Harper's agent has been transfered from duty in back-country Vietnam to Guyana (formerly British Guyana, only recently independent), where he's ended up diving into the sea and recovering a Soyuz black box from the Zond 4 mission (secretly manned, in our game). Last night he got into a firefight on the streets of Georgetown with a local gang called the Black Friars, which went bad for everyone involved. Currently his partner Weaver is bleeding profusely from a machete chop to the upper arm, he's got a gangster named Not Nice duct-taped to a chair, another gangster called Coolie Boy has run off with the black box, and the paramilitary troops are outside restoring order and hunting for the shooters.<br><br/>Right now, John and I each have half the rules, basically, written across two separate notebooks, with John having notes on the player side of things while I have notes on the GM side.  So I can only tell you how it works on my side.  Maybe eventually we'll get them combined and written up!<br/><br/>We have four types of challenges still: <i>individuals</i> (mice), <i>organizations</i> (animals), <i>friction</i> (weather), and the <i>environment</i> (wilderness).  Those are pretty straightforward. Organizations have a nature pool of dice, traits, and bonuses to certain rolls just like animals do.  For example, the Black Friars were an organization -- a street gang -- with Nature 6 (which went down to 5 before the fight because John's character shot one) and +1 to maneuver while on the streets of Georgetown.  <br/><br/>Friction is used when the circumstances of the mission or the current situation prevent you from accomplishing something.  Like, next session, John's character will probably have to search through the slims of Georgetown for Coolie Boy and the Soyuz black box, and he might have to deal with that as friction, if nobody in particular is opposing him but things are chaotic and dangerous.  Just like with weather, though, I mark off when I roll friction and, over time, advance through varying levels of friction (5, 4, 7, 6).  Then, once all the friction is marked off, we get a "Winter session" equivalent and close out the current arc of play.  That hasn't happened yet, but those are our tentative plans.<br/><br/>Nature hasn't completely been worked out yet, since it's easier to play things by ear a bit in a two-player game.  I suggested last night that "self-preservation" should be one of the things for humans, since it helps explain why you roll Nature for defending and maneuvering in fights.  We've discussed getting part of your personal nature from your training or organizations that you belong to (since organizations have their own nature), but haven't settled firmly on something yet.<br/><br/>For fights, since it's two-player, we jot down stats for all the NPCs that are assisting John's character, like Weaver, and he scripts the moves for his side of things while I script mine, just like normal.  Then, when the NPCs on John's side act, we negotiate their actions between the two of us, based on whether John's chosen A/D/M/F.  Typically I've let John describe things, unless I had a particular strong idea about what Weaver would do.<br/><br/>Also, at the end of each session, we've awarded Persona points to NPCs if we ended up deciding that they were MVP, Workhorse, etc.  For example, Weaver got Workhorse for his role in the street battle last session, since he made a lot of the down-and-dirty rolls.  And then, depending on who's rolling for him at the time, either John or I could spend that Persona for Weaver, adding his Nature to a roll or something.  Typically Weaver wouldn't roll for anything, as an NPC, except maybe in fights or if he had some crucial skill that John's character didn't.<br/><br/>On the player side, a lot of the skills have been renamed (fighter -&gt; soldier, weather watcher -&gt; operative) but otherwise they work the same. All the core stats are the same.  We've improvised rules for the guns and stuff based on existing weapons.  Last night, I think the guns just gave +1 to Attack, but I'm sure they'll do more complex things once we have a bunch of different type of equipment available.<br/><br/>In any event, some of these adaptation are more for one-on-one play and less about the setting hack.  The rules are great, both John and I have played MG a fair bit before, and there's a high level of comfort and trust that we can figure things out.  We haven't come across any major issues so far and I don't really anticipate any on the horizon.  But I'm definitely looking forward to seeing where it goes.  Right now we're having so much fun with earthbound black ops that it may take us a while to get to the moon cities!                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352130/#Comment_352130" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T09:15:25+00:00" title="December 21, 2011  9:15AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice writeup, Jonathan!<br/><br/>It sounds like in your game the Nature stat could be used to describe the opposition between regular, human instincts (survival, compassion, etc) and the desires, goals, and trained behaviour of the controlling organization (i.e. the Special Services).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352137/#Comment_352137" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T09:56:05+00:00" title="December 21, 2011  9:56AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> It'd be like playing a Charlie's Angels game and having Charlie be a playable character.</blockquote>\nYou see there is always that player that wants to do just that, and it is usually me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352153/#Comment_352153" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T10:54:32+00:00" title="December 21, 2011 10:54AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Paul:</b> That's a good thought, re: natural instincts vs. training.

From the Burning Wheel forums, from Luke specifically:<br/><br/><i><b>On Hacking Nature</b><br/><br/>    Gentlemice,<br/><br/>    Many of you enjoy hacking the Mouse Guard system. And most of you who do rightly intuit that hacking Nature is the most difficult aspect of such an endeavor. Why is this?<br/><br/>    Nature is the soul of Mouse Guard. It quantifies and qualifies the character as a mouse\u2014as an animal apart from all others in the setting. It does so by describing a series of mouselike behaviors for the character that are useful but generally counter to the entire purpose of the game. To wit: the goal of Mouse Guard is not to play a mouse. When you sit down to play, you are playing a hero. Your game describes that hero's journey and adventures. Rarely in the tales of heroics do we exalt in running away, foraging for seeds or scampering up trees. While those are useful, perhaps essential, aspects of mousehood.<br/><br/>    You see, Nature creates a tension. It is a useful game resource for the players, but using it encourages behaviors counter to the heroic thrust of the game. When you use Nature, you're almost always making a decision about what's important to you; you're almost always sacrificing or risking something. Especially when you play the game long term. What may seem like a series of easy of decisions\u2014use Nature, get benefit!\u2014takes on a different tenor once your Nature is either taxed or advances close to 7.<br/><br/>    When you are hacking Nature, you must take this tension into account. Nature must be unsavory, difficult or downright contentious. It cannot be beneficial. It cannot be occupational. It must be something you are struggling against in the heat of the moment. Are you a mouse or a hero?<br/><br/>    If you make Nature easy or occupational (like Nature: Hero) then you not only drain the tension from the game, but deflate the skill mechanics, too. Since you can use an occupational Nature to do all of the things are important to the character, there's no reason to have skills. There's no reason not to advance your Nature to 7 and pile dice onto every roll. And once you have an optimal strategy like that, all characters become the same and the game quickly becomes boring.<br/><br/>    For good examples of Nature hacks check out Realm Guard and Paul Beakley's upcoming SF hack.<br/><br/>    Thank you for enjoying and playing our games. I hope this helps you squeeze more from them in the future. <br/></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352169/#Comment_352169" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T13:03:19+00:00" title="December 21, 2011  1:03PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2011 1:07PM by J_Walton.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank, Hans!

It's definitely helped my thinking and I'll probably post about whatever we end up doing.<br/><br/>So far, we've just been tapping Nature as appropriate and not worrying if it was inside or outside of someone's nature, which still works pretty well if you don't know quite what you want to do with Nature yet.  Persona points are still a pretty strong limitation.  Brian, I'd actually just recommend doing that if you don't want to define what Nature is, just as the easiest hack.<br/><br/>For more complicated hacks, sure, ditch Nature!  It won't be MG anymore, but who cares, really?  The New Mutants hack I made (<i>Danger SXool</i>) replaced Nature with your mutant powers. You taxed your powers not by doing stuff outside your Nature but my overloading your powers.  So you might have "Telekenesis 4," which you could tap all the time, but if you chose to use it as "Telekenesis 6" for one roll, it became "Telekenesis 2" until you recovered from the tax.  Or you could use it as "Telekenesis 8" but then not be able to use your powers at all, at least for a while. It might not be MG anymore, but oh well.

It's a list of "you should act this way" reminders on the page, all the time, reminding the player that they're generally acting un-naturally. In MG this means they're acting heroically -- it's a nice little validation that, in fact, you're not acting like a mouse. The good MG hacks I think will tap into this, and back it up with mechanical teeth. <br><br>But they're not super-sharp teeth, not at least while your Nature is middling-to-low. <br><br>But you get it to the 4+ range, and now you've got a phat stat you can use for damned near everything, and be awesome. Then it accelerates at 5, and at 6 the player has to make a conscious, active effort to keep from sliding down that slope to the end-of-game state. Six dice! Invoke it with a Persona and now it's 12 dice! 12! That's just crazy-appealing but it doesn't really show up at the table 'til it's almost over.

Some of the tension isn't there that is so fabulous in longer term play. In a 1 shot, it's really hard to not blow your Nature when you are in a conflict, they Feinted, you Attacked, now they have no defense (Attack cancels out a Feint) so you burn a Persona point and destroy their disposition. The reward is too compelling in a 1 shot. <br><br>I've found it helps if I keep GM / Player turns short so we can play 2 games in a normal 4 hour slot. And I will often start players with tapped Nature and conditions but give them more Fate/Persona as well as skills with Passes/Fails marked off so they can level up in play.<br><br>The other thing I've started doing is use Nature as an Aspect I compel like in Fate (but without the reward). You know, that fighter skill is only a 2 but if you run away, you can roll 5 Nature dice! The players almost never run away but if they stop and consider it for even a moment, I feel the added tension makes the decision to roll their Fighter skill that much more thrilling.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352246/#Comment_352246" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T08:39:08+00:00" title="December 22, 2011  8:39AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John: Totally agreed on all points.

I've seen what you describe in play too once players realise they can really burn through Nature; never thought about starting the game with conditions and/or Nature tapped, though - must do that, as I tend to be running MG as gritty melodrama which would suit the PCs all starting out Angry, Tired, or Hungry.<br><br>In my experience of running at cons, where the game really sings is with the talky conflicts - lots of games do edge-of-the-seat Fighting, but once the players get the hang of an important Speech or Argument conflict they end up really going for it - there's a really nice moment when the system and the roleplaying at the table come together. In terms of scripting conflicts I advise players to just come up with a narrative and then pick their moves from it, rather than trying to think about the tactical interactions and second guess what their opponent is going to do - while this might work with more experienced players, for the first couple of times I found it just bogs play down as they consider combinations.<br><br/>I've not played or run Realm Guard, but it's interesting to note what you can use Nature for in it - Dunedain Nature is for Tradition, Family, and Grief, IIRC. Grief, man - THAT, more than anything, sells me on Realm Guard.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352250/#Comment_352250" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T08:47:54+00:00" title="December 22, 2011  8:47AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a> B, +1                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352251/#Comment_352251" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T08:50:55+00:00" title="December 22, 2011  8:50AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome Millsy! <br/><br/>I like to use my roleplaying to hint at my tactical choices to foreshadow and give players some clues.

A lot of the mechanics encourage a pretty deep familiarity with the world of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>What I would really love is a proper Song of Ice and Fire Night's Watch hack. Mouse Guard, as has been noted here before, is overwhelmingly suited to that setting, and thanks to the HBO show everyone and their dad is familiar with the setting. There was an attempt to create a Night's Watch hack over at the MG forums, but it never really got off the ground, and I think it was getting much too complicated considering how appropriate the system is already: <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?10605-Night-s-Watch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?10605-Night-s-Watch</a> Something re-skinny, more like Realm Guard, would be best, I think (maybe even a hack of Realm Guard, since many aspects of it would fit perfectly).<br/><br/>With regards to Nature, I think the Night's Watch setting is perfect, because the core tension for a Crow is between dedication to guarding the realms of men and the past life. Jon Snow especially is constantly compromising the ideals of the Watch in order to accomplish its goals (and his own goals). Noble blood, family ties, friends, desire for love and sex, criminal or evil urges, etc. - a Night's Watchman is expected to repress these things, in spite of their utility and importance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352367/#Comment_352367" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T11:46:11+00:00" title="December 23, 2011 11:46AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it'd be interesting/educational to walk through how one might do a Night's Watch hack.
