(I have to apologize that I can't remember who came forward with this observation.) They sit and wait and wait for the system to bring about something great. I heard similar remarks at other places. Since I never made this experience I'm curios if this really is a widespread phenomenon. Have you ever followed the rules and forgot to play? Or have you ever observed this by others?<br/><br/>What might be the reasons for playing a game with the attention strictly focused on what the rules are demanding or allowing and thereby forgetting to have fun? One explanation that seems not to far-fetched is that players might trust the game author and think: \u201cThe author of the game probably did an excellent job in designing the rules; he had a vision of the actual play experience and developed the perfect system for creating exactly this play experience \u2013 so  we better follow his lead.\u201d And then somewhere between trust and hope they forget that every good game requires a lot more of the players than just following the rules. - However, I'm not sure that this line of thought really hits the mark. Do you have any comments on this? Or do you have any alternative suggestions why someone is so eager to play by the book that he changes his roleplaying behavior in a way that obstructs his usual performance?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230491/#Comment_230491" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T02:55:39+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  2:55AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure people "forget" to play, so much as are oblivious of just how much a roleplaying game depends on the contributions people make at the table. Regardless of which side of the System Matters/Doesn't Matter divide people fall, I've often seen them attribute their good ideas, clever roleplaying and downright brilliant contributions to something external. Be it the rules, the setting or the superb qualities of the GM. <br/><br/>I think a lot of people have bought into this illusion, that a game/GM somehow elicits good play out of people. So much so, that they expect the two to magically tease it out of them. Especially when they sit down to play a game, that has been hailed as providing great and exciting play. (Mind, this is all just me speculating wildly based on a handful observations I've made over time.)<br/><br/>That's not to say that a good GM or a good rules set cannot help provide a gaming environment that makes it feel easy or natural to contribute, and to do it well. It's just when players buy into the notion that that is all it takes, that you run into problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230497/#Comment_230497" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T04:15:39+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  4:15AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its not just people who are oblivious.

It would be more accurate to say, "following the rules and not having <b>time</b> to play". <br/><br/>In D&amp;D 4E, an average player (which the storygames crowd doesn't represent) doesn't have enough time to play the game by the rules, play situations that take advantage of those rules (playing 1 encounter doesn't properly test your resources), and still have enough time to engage the game's fiction in any deep way if you only play for 4 hours. This is discussed at length on forums and blogs dedicated to D&amp;D. It's a pretty wildly accepted problem and become more so accepted and talked about daily. Even people in the RPGA (who usually following the rules strictly) are changing more of the rules so they have more time to play. <br/><br/>The 4 hour time slot is key as this is less of a problem if you play for 8 hours (which we don't).<br/><br/>The other factor is we play a lot of different games and play frequently. Many people only play 1 game semi-regularly or infrequently. So more is on the line when they play. It had better be worth it. And when it isn't, since they are playing only 1 game, it's easier to hack that game till it fits their needs. Which makes sense. But to us, since we play many games frequently, it's easier to abandon games that don't support our needs and play something else. <br/><br/>Yet another factor is we play a lot of boardgames. So when we play RPGs, we prefer to play games where it is easier to engage and spend more time with the fiction. If it feels like we are playing a boardgame and just slapping colorful descriptions on top that don't matter in meaningful ways, we will probably stop playing it after we have learned the game. We love boardgames. If we are in the mood to play a boardgame, we will play a boardgame. That being said, I enjoy boardgame like rules in my RPGs. That's not an issue for us as long as we can engage the fiction in meaningful ways. <br/><br/>That being said, just like storygames doesn't represent the average player, neither do we. I wouldn't take our experiences as a broader example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230523/#Comment_230523" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T07:17:16+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  7:17AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2009 7:19AM by jackson_tegu.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have noticed this in myself, especially when i am facilitating a game, and double especially when that game is of my own design and unfinished.<br/>Though i am getting better, i focus more on the social plane and checking in to see if folks are enjoying themselves, and leave the fiction for others<br/>to deal with.

In a way it seems natural to foucs even harder on the game mechanics when you intend to judge how good it works and how it could be improved. Maybe playtesting is a kind of hybrid situation: of course you're eager to play and want to have a good time. But at the same time you have an additional goal namely you want to scrutinize the system in order to improve it. That kind of goes in the way of just experiencing the flow of playing.<br/><br/>@ jenskot<br/>The D&amp;D example is great because I thought that this might be basically a problem with players who play Indiegames (this was the context where others mentioned the problem).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230558/#Comment_230558" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T09:17:59+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  9:17AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jenskot">@Jenskot</a><br/><br/>are you talking about living and organized play or just dnd play in general? <br/><br/>Wasn't sure from your post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230701/#Comment_230701" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T19:59:48+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  7:59PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2009 8:02PM by Andy.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had this happen a few times, usually in the playtest of games. I think the last time it happened was playtestign Eric P's The Infected (in the end, it wasn't a very fun session; but the next session we did WAS fun and made up for it). Oh, I remember that it also happened at times in a campaign of AGON we played: We really wanted to get on to the last story part, but realized that to refresh our stats we had to basically have a bunch of contests that none of us really wanted to go through with. We went through the motions, roleplaying lightly, until the contests were over. When we got to the next session of the story we looked back and were like, "What the fuck did we just do? That wasn't role-playing, that was some bullshit that we had to do because the rules were in the way". But we later houseruled it so that we didn't have to do that sort of thing again, and stick to the stories that we wanted to.<br/><br/>EDIT: It seems to happen most with games that have a really vast field of rules: Where there are a lot of rules in play, or where you have to be aware of more on your sheet than the next skill for your next task. These kinds of games with lots of handling time are fun, but they can be frustrating at times, too.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jan" title="Jan"><img alt="Jan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://api.ning.com/files/aMCvJWa*119KpxWfJKRX3wq*4TaoGdbPDFLD2u-xwv3UxkjerE6mt2*bPXjTPEakxlyfWEOhLHh83PvGpr4dR0WqgIT-CrY4/madmansig.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;crop=1%3A1"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jan">Jan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230734/#Comment_230734" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T01:56:24+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  1:56AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So far, two ways of following the rules and thereby lowering the fun of playing have been mentioned. First, some rules are to complex or maybe in others ways dysfunctional. Therefore following them consumes to much time or distracts from the cool parts of roleplaying (whatever these are). Secondly, sometimes when you're playtesting a game you're so obsessed with observing how the rules work that you're not in the right frame of mind to just let go and play freely.<br/><br/>Has anyone also observed a kind of passivity that has it's roots in the idea that following the rules is all that is required for having a good roleplaying experience? In contrast to the two aforementioned problems that could happen during a "normal" session (no playtest) and even with a system that is neither to complex nor in other ways broken. This could happen while playing a really good game. In this case the problem is not in the game but in the attitude of the players towards playing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
