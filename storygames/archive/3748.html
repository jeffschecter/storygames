Does anyone think we may have started to reach that point? Or is there something in the 'story game' that will head this off?<br/><br/>Curious as always.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83996/#Comment_83996" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T07:35:48+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  7:35AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ian,<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt that there will be "Story-Game Heartbreakers." Largely the cause of Fantasy Heartbreakers is that the designers work in a vacuum, having only played D&amp;D (or perhaps Rolemaster, or such). So what you're proposing is that somebody starts playing RPGs with, say, Dust Devils, not knowing somehow about all of the other indie RPGs out there (or just not caring to look at them at all), and then decides that he doesn't like Dust Devils as written, and then decides to write his own version of  Dust Devils, only improving what he sees as it's flaws, and not paying any attention to the large body of complaints about Dust Devils...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich don't exist...<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, it's an entirely different source, so you really can't get the same effect. I don't think. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr do you have a candidate in mind? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83999/#Comment_83999" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T07:39:03+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  7:39AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm. Well, the thing about fantasy heartbreakers is that they all look only at D&amp;D and nothing else for source material, add a house rule or two for how armor or weapons work, and add like 2-3 cool things in the mechanic and setting... but otherwise they're D&amp;D (or sometimes Runequest) with the SN filed off.<br/><br/>I see lots of Trends in Story Games. Stuff like:<br/>Scene Framing<br/>Dice Pools<br/>"I use my Ennui to roll an extra 2d6!"<br/>Endgame<br/><br/>However, I'm not seeing people consistently take one game, like Dogs in the Vineyard, and make something exactly like it.  I see tons of games influenced by Dogs (namely games where you get more dice by drawing upon character traits, flaws, emotions, and relationships), but nothing that looks like Dogs, But With 2 Different Gimmicks.<br/><br/>So in terms of Heartbreaker, I doubt we'll ever see that. However, we might see some strong trending that's worth analyzing and perhaps even "getting past". Trends that the author internalizes and takes for granted.  <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84000/#Comment_84000" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T07:41:04+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  7:41AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I dunno ...

It's (maybe) easy to look at a bunch of story games and see:<br/><br/>"Frame Scene. Roleplay to Conflict. Resolve Conflict. Assign Fallout/Change Stats. Frame Scene, repeat."<br/><br/>as the common thread. Take it a few steps further and you have your Story Games Heartbreaker. Which, as we've kind of established, is a completely different animal then a Fantasy Heartbreaker in so many ways. We're really just re purposing a familiar term here, I guess.<br/><br/>I agree with Joshua. These games do exist. This doesn't make them bad games... instead, I think there's a lot of really good and cool games out there that are taking what has gone before and doing really cool stuff, but not actually bringing anything new to the table. I don't think this is always for lack of effort or creativity either. We're at a weird spot right now as a community (I think) where everything is moving pretty fast, and it's easy to come up with a neat idea and have it be "sooo last month" by the time you finish your first draft. And there are plenty of games coming out that, as I said, are doing cool stuff with existing ideas, but aren't actually bringing new ideas forward (and I know I'm saying this like it has nothing to do with me, but I'd throw some of the stuff I've worked on into this category as well).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20O%27Rourke" title="Ian O'Rourke"><img alt="Ian O'Rourke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20O%27Rourke">Ian O'Rourke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84061/#Comment_84061" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T09:59:23+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  9:59AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As possible example, could the Marvel Universe game be put forward as the first, relative high profile story game heartbreaker?

It's easy to grasp, the formalization of scenes and conflicts does some good work in focusing play out of the default D&amp;D splatter of "stuff happens," and it consequently gets picked up in lots of games.<br/><br/>For my money, when that chassis is the bulk of the game, you've got a story game heartbreaker.  Adding some fiddly bits on the sides, or some cleverly-named stats, is not enough.  Your new ideas have to penetrate to the point where they shape play and make the game <em>not</em> a series of identical scenes, but something that has a shape and texture of its own.  In <em>Primetime Adventures</em>, that thing is the combination of Screen Presence and Fan Mail.  Those two mechanics, and the way that they interact, shapes play so that different scenes <em>feel different</em>.<br/><br/>Of course, a lot of "story games" don't follow the boxcars format at all.  <em>Sorcerer</em> doesn't; <em>Dogs</em> doesn't; <em>The Shadow of Yesterday</em> doesn't.  These games don't have formal scenes and allow follw-up conflicts all over the place, and that structure works for those games.  The thing that makes a story game heartbreaker is the assumption that Frame-Roleplay-Conflict-Fallout will work for your game without figuring out <em>why</em>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84071/#Comment_84071" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T10:17:25+00:00" title="July 30, 2007 10:17AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>and now and again I just don't see the magic happening, and it makes me sad.</blockquote>\nIn other words, the "Huh, I can just do this with Primetime Adventures instead" Effect? <br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>ps: I love PtA.

In a way, aren't they the topic of that thread a few months ago, regarding games that are not ready for publishing and should have been released as ashcans rather than finished products?  Yes, I realize that there is a difference between, say, insufficient playtesting or poor editing and derivative or unsatisfactory mechanics, but I think the latter can be rooted out through through the former, to an extent at least.  <br/><br/>And I feel that many of the game design contests (e.g., 24-hour game, game chef, etc.) yield SG heartbreakers among the numerous entries.  It's excusable and understandable since the contests attract new, amateur, or semi-pro designers among the participants, but there we are.<br/><br/>As a footnote: Although we soon hear the request for specific examples, I for one don't feel comfortable pointing to specific games saying, "There's my SG heartbreaker."  We do this in the larger context of RPGs at large because we get a bit more anonymity, but when we do this in the story game world, the community is so small that we feel (I feel) uncomfortable saying So-and-so's game is flawed.

Indeed, its original working title was the utterly tongue-in-cheek <i>Heartbreaker</i>. I wanted to try to build a game that used a large subset of the then-current State of the Art and see what fell away when I tried to get a working game that did what I wanted.<br/><br/>It had "boxcars", it had everything is a flag, it had fallout, it had all that stuff.<br/><br/>It just didn't work. And as I worked on it, paring things away, I kept being left with something that almost worked but was missing something. At this point, <i>The Real Me</i> is a game concept that is not going to go anywhere unless I can get that thing that will take it out of Heartbreaker-land. The thing is: all of those pieces are useful pieces. Some form of each of them will probably be part of a working <i>The Real Me</i>. It's just that (a) there's a piece missing and (b) they need to get assembled in a way that actually suits the game.

The game is about face-stabbing in the Clinton sense of asking, "What would you stab someone in the face for?" (following Sorcerer, Dust Devils, Dogs In the Vineyard, Shab Al-Hiri Roach: do X bad thing for X good thing, but IS IT WORTH IT???!!!  ARGH THE VAMPIRE ANGST IS UNBEARABLE!!!)<br/><br/>2. Your traits are abstract things instead of Sneaking and Small Boat Sailing in D&amp;D ilk.  You have traits like "My Mother Didn't Let Me Watch Ninja Turtles For Feel It Would Cause Me To Be Violent" and "In My Nightmares I Am a Unicorn Ecoterrorist."  A key part of the game is out-emo the other players during character creation by coming up with the traits that make the other players say "DUDE, AWESOME!!!" the loudest.<br/><br/>3. The game ends best when everyone is dead, bonus points for people committing suicide and double bonus points for ritual suicide.<br/><br/>P.S. Trust mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84188/#Comment_84188" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T21:15:00+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  9:15PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>"In My Nightmares I Am a Unicorn Ecoterrorist."</blockquote>\nDUDE.

Soaking a fresh game in the same stale gravy, out of habit.</blockquote>\nI discuss my own fallback into detective mode in DitV in a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3743&amp;page=1#Item_6" rel="nofollow">different thread</a>. Not to derail this one, but in your opinion, is the heartbreaker here caused by the player(s) or the game? Is it sheer stubbornness that causes GMs and player to make this mistake, or did Vincent miss something when he wrote it? I argue that the town creation process outlined in DitV causes a GM to "weave a web" of sins and sinners, and that the assumption is that players should unravel that web, when the real fun is getting stuck in the web and having to fight your way out of it. I'm not sure the text conveys this enough on its own.<br/><br/>If this is caused by ingrained behaviour trained by decades of playing other games, and not by the game itself, does it qualify as a heartbreaker?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84194/#Comment_84194" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T22:36:42+00:00" title="July 30, 2007 10:36PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To echo James, how does The New Honesty fit in with this unwillingness to own up to the heartbreaker games you're thinking of? Giving your honest opinion of a game doesn't necessarily require actual play; if you've bought it and taken the trouble to read it, then you're entitled to your opinion. Explaining why you're not motivated to play a game is a valuable insight.<br/><br/>And the designer will likely thank you for it. As a designer releasing my first game, I want to know the bad as well as the good - otherwise I'll make the same mistakes with my next design.

Boyd</cite>To echo James, how does The New Honesty fit in with this unwillingness to own up to the heartbreaker games you're thinking of? Giving your honest opinion of a game doesn't necessarily require actual play; if you've bought it and taken the trouble to read it, then you're entitled to your opinion. Explaining why you're not motivated to play a game is a valuable insight.</blockquote>\nHeh.  My honesty is long-ingrained, and I do feel entitled to my opinion, but as I get older I tend to pick my battles more than in my youth.  If I express an opinion about a game, I have to be ready not only to explain and support it (which should be a given) but also to <i>defend</i> it and the right to even have this opinion.  I read and play lots and lots of games; I mean, really a <b>lot</b>.  But I only give feedback on a few, and review even fewer.  <br/><br/>I recently reviewed a game that is popular (<i>Burning Empires</i>) and gave it a poor score though I tried to explain why, and for what type of gamer this game would work well and get a high score.  Not only did I get a long thread of moderate contention on RPGNet, but it spilled over to SG as well.  Whenever I give negative comments about any game (particularly one that has received its share of "Awesome!" from others before), I know that I will face a lot of flack.  Consequently, I try to do this only when I care a lot for one reason or another.<br/><br/>Let me give you an immediate example.  My biggest SG heartbreaker is PTA.  Yes, everyone's favourite SG game, <i>Primetime Adventures</i>.  While it has some fantastic stuff to say, really groundbreaking ideas about creating a story, sharing authority, framing scenes, etc., I find the actual resolution mechanics to be so frustrating that I can't play the game in its pure un-houseruled form.  I won't repeat the detail of my gripe here, but when I articulated this a couple of years ago on an RPGNet discussion, I got shouted down so badly that I lost all taste for discussing the game.  If I ever pick up that discussion again (like, I guess, now) it will have to be for something more than just pointing out what a heartbreaker is.  In this case, it's to give a stark example of my more general discomfort in criticizing something other people love.\n<blockquote>And the designer will likely thank you for it. As a designer releasing my first game, I want to know the bad as well as the good - otherwise I'll make the same mistakes with my next design. My biggest fear in putting out my game is not getting a bad review or negative feedback, but being ignored and hearing nothing at all.</blockquote>\nI rather doubt that this holds true for the average designer.  Designers may be OK with negative feedback at the playtest and ashcan stages, but once a game is officially released, most people are not happy with criticism.  \n<blockquote>If you're uncomfortable just listing games that failed for you, that are your heartbreakers, then make a post in The Game Report where you briefly explain your thoughts on a particular game.<br/><br/>Seriously, The New Honesty is almost as completely empty and useless as the old code of silence if people won't offer informal criticism as well as lengthy actual play-based reviews since only a few people are doing such reviews.</blockquote>\nLike I said, my honesty is not new.  :-}  And I am firmly resolved to stick to actual play reviews, not only because it gives better insight into a game (duh) but also because it gives a certain moral advantage to the reviewer.  I will continue to play, comment and review games, but I'll also continue to pick my battles.  I do, however, try to give my constructive criticism at an early stage for games that are in design or playtest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84245/#Comment_84245" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T09:13:44+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  9:13AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think... as has been already noted, there are several issues on the table in this thread.<br/><br/>One is the notion of the "Heartbreaker," which, as Mike has mentioned several times, is a specific term for a specific kind of published product.  I think it's important for games to be named, because if people are just dropping games on their shelves to collect dust no one gets to learn from that game.<br/><br/>I think the second issue is dull design.  People grabbing concepts from other games and slapping them together willy-nilly.  (A "heartbreaker" is someone working hard to "fix" D&amp;D.  Dull design just seems like, "I'll design a game too!")  Again, if we can't put games on the table for discussion, what the heck?<br/><br/>The third is, is the game "Broken"?  I bring this up because I'd love to know if some of the games on the shelves are "Heartbreakers" -- as some people say the games on their shelves are -- or actually constructed badly.  <br/><br/>This last one is important -- but the path is strange and horrible in discussion.  For Sophie, <i>Primetime Adventures </i>is broken.  Now, I went back and tracked down the RPG.net thread she referenced... and I can say, "Um, I have no idea at all how you played that session, but how you described the rules working isn't how, in my experience, the rules actually work."<br/><br/>Which means there's going to be a discussion/argument about the rules being broken or not.  And some rules <i>are</i> broken.  But some or not, but someone doesn't grok something about them.  But, of course, the person who might not have grokked will be in the position of saying, "Yes, I 'got' the rules, and they don't work!" <br/><br/>And there we are... either helping someone find their way into a game that does work but either has some hinks in the text or has a few notions that are kind of bizarre that aren't clear on the first read (which translates into lack of clarity in play.)<br/><br/>This means that sometimes a discussion on the internet leads to clarity.  Or annoyance for all involved.<br/><br/>Because several people have posted that they've got games on their shelves that they'll never touch again.<br/><br/>But is it because they are Heartbreakers? Because they are dull in their design and do nothing new? Or because there's something fundamentally wrong and/or misunderstood about the rules.<br/><br/>As a consumer (not a designer) or games, I'd rather hear what people have to say about games than hide them away for me to pick up and be stuck with on my shelf collecting dust.<br/><br/>Moreover, comments from people who don't like games always clarify things for games I do like.  For example, in Sophie's criticism's of PtA, I was able to read her comments and realize how some people might interpret the rules of the game. Whether she plays the game again doesn't matter to me.  What does matter is, I can see where she and her group made the turn in the text to how the game plays. And now I'll be on my toes to make sure that doesn't happen.<br/><br/>Talking about RPGs -- whether they work or don't -- is fraught with the potential for all sorts of miscommunication and frustration.  But I don't see how anything useful can be done if people don't do it with things we can all read and play and compare our experiences.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84255/#Comment_84255" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T09:58:14+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  9:58AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sophie,<br/><br/>I agree that if you're going to offer an opinion you should explain and support it, but defending your right to have it should not be necessary. You're right to point out that if the community really wants honest criticism its members cannot go around attacking those who offer it. It's unfortunate that you've had that happen to you.<br/><br/>As for the question of whether designers want criticism of their published games, if they only want praise then I have no problem saying such a person is a poor designer. Print runs are generally small in this community, so there's always a chance to correct things down the line. And we've seen a lot of second editions and revised second printings, even from some of the most well-know designers. So it's clear that a lot of designers are using continuing criticism to make their games better. <br/><br/>I agree with you that actual play reviews are awesome, and I appreciate your efforts to write them. But, again, understanding why a game is sitting on someone's shelf unplayed is important, too. I'd really like to see more informal discussion of why a game doesn't work for someone.

The way I am reading it, in very simplistic terms is that if you are designing a game you must not:<br/>\n<br/>\n(a) blindly use the successful tools that have been used before, even if you like them<br/>\n(b) in your attempts to not use them, try not to be too wacky...<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, that leaves very little wiggle room to the aspirant designer. In my travails in design, I have already managed to stumble, through parallel evolution over mechanics which I thought were innovative and yet were almost carbon copies of other games (I managed to 'discover' aspects ala SotC before I read SotC. I even called them Aspects!). There are so many story games that it's already a minefield trying to find a niche to settle in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe underlying tone of this just makes it harder.

I get the impression that one of the points of this thread is that if you are just going to re-hash the same old thing, then why make a whole new game for it?<br><br>So in line with a previously-mentioned idea, if you have a game with a solid and definite purpose in mind, and your game meets that purpose by using several established story-gaming conventions a little bit differently than other systems, is it still a heartbreaker?

With mainstream fantasy, it's a lot more apparent to me, but I'm not quite seeing it here.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84277/#Comment_84277" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T10:47:30+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 10:47AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2007 10:47AM by blankshield.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neil,<br><br>Write your game.

Not the games, not how the rules are supposed to be played, but the actual wording.<br/><br/>When you write, "If a guy is lambasting me with "problems" that he sees in my game which I (and everyone else who has ever played the game) know on first sight do not come up in actual play ... that is of very little use to me."<br/><br/>All I can say is, sometimes people grok the text write away, other times they don't.  And sometimes it's because the people playing are part of a certain group or culture, or have been waiting for a certain kind of game and then, Click. It all falls into place. <br/><br/>But I think <i>everyone</i> who writes RPGs better take a step back and stop blaming the readers for not getting the rules. The truth is, most RPG texts are full of ambiguity. <br/><br/>Now, some people never finish the rules and just start playing anyway.  (I'm assuming Call Me Curly's Dog's example above is a case of this.)  But Sophie read the rules to PtA <i>and</i> played it... and somehow she saw patches of the rules that should be Red as Blue. And I'll be blunt: the text in PtA is <i>not</i> clear in several areas. (In particular, to name names: What are "stakes"? How is conflict defined? What do the players actually do once the winner of the narration has been determines?) I know how to play <i>now.</i>  But the first time I played the Producer used Dogs in the Vineyard style up/down stakes and kind of drained the scenes of the narrative juice PtA thrives on.<br/><br/>I really, really doubt most writers of the texts really, really read the texts with the eye of "Okay, no one knows that I'm talking about."  <br/><br/>I know in my own work, as a writer of fiction, over the years I've learned to be a hard-ass on my own work in one specific area first and foremost: Clarity. Line by line, sentence by sentence, is it clear.  And then, at the macro level, is it clear as a whole. <br/><br/>And I don't think saying, "Well, there are emergent qualities in play," cuts it. If that's the case, <i>tell</i> me the emergent qualities. Be explicit. Be <i>clear</i>.  Give me, in clear terms, what to expect, how to do it. If this means giving up some breezy or excitable tone in the text, then so be it.  That the ideas for an RPG design are cool is one thing. That they are expressed clearly is another.<br/><br/>Also this: someone might jump in with, "Well, I'm only designing this for this community."  I don't know if anyone <i>will</i> do that, but I've seen words to that effect here and there.  If anyone is thinking of saying that, let me call a pre-emptive, "Bullshit." You put a price tag on it and send it out into the world, it's your job to make sure someone picking it up can play.<br/><br/>I'm not saying all confusion can be removed -- at all. (See, again, the DitV example above.)  But a lot of rules are badly organized, assume all will be clear once you fit all the pieces together (which doesn't help me if I'm confused about the pieces), and lean more toward selling me how much fun the game is going to be rather than explicitly and clearly telling me how to make the fun.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's easy. I'm every willing to say we might not even have figured out how to make things clear. I am saying that once a designer puts on his Writer's Hat clarity is the primary job -- and that's not always there.<br/><br/>And I'm saying, "Boy, these people not understanding my text must be dumbasses," might not be as helpful (or honest) as, "Okay, someone's confused. What did I do as the writer? How do I make this clearer."<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84291/#Comment_84291" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T11:34:53+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 11:34AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Maybe everyone should take a long, hard look at their texts.

Presumably, the millions of variants that developed from Chaturanga were heartbreakers in <i>some</i> sense.

What were some examples of scenes?"  <br/><br/>Until things like that are sorted out first, how the heck can we even begin to guess as to why someone did or did not have a good time with a game?<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84361/#Comment_84361" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T13:40:57+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  1:40PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite>The way I am reading it, in very simplistic terms is that if you are designing a game you must not:<br/><br/>(a) blindly use the successful tools that have been used before, even if you like them<br/>(b) in your attempts to not use them, try not to be too wacky...</blockquote>\nYou should never, ever blindly use any tool.  <br/><br/>I think you're laying out these things as if no one should reasonably agree that you must not do those things.<br/><br/>But you use the word "blindly".<br/><br/>The world as a whole could do without all the "blindly".<br/><br/>What we are saying is -- wait, that's fucked.  Where's that "we" coming from?<br/><br/>What <i>I</i> am saying is:<br/><br/>- Steal.  Steal, steal, steal.  Best things come from theft.  Theft is sacred. Practice it.<br/><br/>- But, <b>think</b> about what you build with what you steal.  Theft is a power drill.  Would you put a power drill to your skull and press the "go" switch without thinking about whether or not you should, first?  I hope not.  <i>But lots of heartbreakers do just that.</i><br/><br/>- Then, consider what gives your game <b>identity</b>.  If there are not unique elements in your game -- elements of system which specifically shore up what your game is "about", in the "Big Three Questions" sense -- then you may be building a heartbreaker, one which is indistinguishable from other games which already exist.  This may be perfectly fine to do if you're just making your game for yourself.  But if you are building a game with the intent of publication and successful sale, your game has to have its own identity.  The guys in suits call this something like "establishing market differentiators".  Your game has to have <i>something</i> in it that establishes it as different.  My own bias on this topic is such that I might even go so far as to assert that if you can't make a reasonable claim of difference, you <i>should not</i> publish with the intent of successful sales (but by all means, give it away for free; I'm not suggesting censorship of kitbashed game ideas -- gods know that's essentially what the earliest Fate versions were, for us).<br/><br/>- Finally, whatever you've put together absolutely must be <b>tested</b>.  Even if you're stealing mechanics from other games, that's no guarantee that those games got those mechanics right <i>for the purposes you're putting them to in your own game</i>.  This in the end is the big buggaboo about using "existing technology" in a new application -- you need to make sure it's the right fit.  Theft isn't a last step, it's a <i>first step</i> and has a number of -- IMO -- mandatory steps following it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: phasmaphobic</cite>So in line with a previously-mentioned idea, if you have a game with a solid and definite purpose in mind, and your game meets that purpose by using several established story-gaming conventions a little bit differently than other systems, is it still a heartbreaker?  This question comes from my confusion here as to what exactly we're defining as a heartbreaker.  With mainstream fantasy, it's a lot more apparent to me, but I'm not quite seeing it here.</blockquote>\nA heartbreaker is -- sorry to be tautological -- something which breaks your heart.  Something which fails to live up to its promise.  Something which clearly the creator was excited about but failed to create something that replicates that excitement in others.<br/><br/>It's easy to fall into the heartbreaker trap by stealing, but not thinking about what you're stealing.  Without combining theft with identity (see above), you'll end up creating something which comes off as flavorless and unexciting.  That doesn't do you a service, and doesn't do your audience a service.  All that I think this thread is trying to encourage is the careful, forward-thinking navigation of such dangerous waters.  Nobody likes to see a good game idea get beached.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84388/#Comment_84388" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T15:25:12+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  3:25PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite>The way I am reading it, in very simplistic terms is that if you are designing a game you must not:<br/><br/>(a) blindly use the successful tools that have been used before, even if you like them<br/>(b) in your attempts to not use them, try not to be too wacky...<br/><br/>To me, that leaves very little wiggle room to the aspirant designer.</blockquote>\nOthers have already posted better, more lucid responses to this.  Listen to them first.  Then there's my not-entirely-positive response: while a heartbreaker may not be a very good product, writing one can be an excellent learning experience.  This is one of the reasons that I like all our game design challenges: it allows folks to write with few expectations.  It allows them to try on the game designer hat, see what it's like, get a view from the inside, and 'complete' a game design.  That sort of perspective is priceless when it comes to designing the next game "for real."<br/><br/>Because more important than writing a game that lots of other people will play is writing a game that teaches you something.<br/><br/>So don't worry; design your game, learn what you can, and <em>then</em> decide if it's a product.  Then design the next one. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20O%27Rourke" title="Ian O'Rourke"><img alt="Ian O'Rourke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20O%27Rourke">Ian O'Rourke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84493/#Comment_84493" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T00:49:33+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 12:49AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, that's probably a very good point. It seems to go along the same lines as a writers first novel is rarely the one published, unless your really lucky and/or talented, but you can bet he learned a lot by having that novel in front of him finished.<br/><br/>I think that's a very good point.
