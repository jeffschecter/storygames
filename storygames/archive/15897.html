It is like walking around in a filing cabinet that was organized by someone with very specific bad ideas about information management,and who lives in the late twenties. It is not particularly friendly or easy to use, but it is really, really fun once you get the hang of it. <br/><br/>One thing that is particularly endearing is Plotto's excursions into genre fiction. Most of the plot elements are generic, but occasionally you get cannibals, or magic potions, or enemy spies, or vengeful ghosts.<br/><br/>Converting it into an electronic plotting aid is the first thought of literally everyone who touches the book. It wouldn't be hard, just very, very tedious. There are thousands of entries, each with multiple permutations, many with special use cases depending on where you are coming from or going to in the plot sequence. I'd rather eat a gun than take that on, but it'd be pretty straightforward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361102/#Comment_361102" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T09:44:18+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  9:44AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I just downloaded this from Amazon to my kindle.
