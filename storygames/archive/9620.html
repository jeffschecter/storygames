The folks from ntrpg.org used to put out a zine called "Visionary" that was largely group-translated source material and adventures for older English-language roleplaying games, but that was just the tip of the iceberg.  They put teams together on their forums, divide up books into sections and then have at it.  It's amazing, actually, since most materials never make it into Chinese, so that have to do all of it themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213500/#Comment_213500" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T15:09:46+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  3:09PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2009 3:16PM by Andy.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: the cat</cite>I would like to see a program set up where a person confirms they own the book and someone hands out a translated copy.

A friend of mine (ironically, met him a few years back at GenCon when working at the Forge booth) performed an almost D&amp;D4E-style reconceptualization of the game, from the ground up. The basics (ideas of classes, some of the table-based elements) are there yet streamlined, the game is more Modernish, which totally appeals to me: Fans of recent console RPGs and anime will find something to love in SW2.0, but fans of the older edition sometimes complain about the "modernness" or "non-Western-ness" of the changes in setting and feel.<br/><br/>The old Sword World is a fossil: Interesting to know about, and maybe peek at, but not quite as fun to play. SW2.0 is a different beast: As easy to play as the original, with modern sensibilities in setting (anime-ish) and rules (no "choose one single class and pursue forever", rather you assemble your character by combining 2-4 character classes together).<br/><br/>But yeah, I've already translated about 80% of the book in my head. Could probably even run it given a day's notice. But first, I need to finish my other huge outstanding project before I'll let myself get carried away further.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213502/#Comment_213502" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T15:14:55+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  3:14PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2009 3:18PM by Andy.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=10333841&amp;postcount=60" rel="nofollow">Here's a link to a collection of character concept art</a>, showing off how it's more anime-ish than previous versions.<br/><br/>Modern sensibilities include:<br/>Cute furry animal class (Tabbit: Bunny-people)<br/>Dwarven females basically do not appear to age after a certain point, basically remaining as "chibi anime girls with axes" for their long lives.<br/>Runefolk: Android-like people, often dress like butlers/maids<br/>Core class: Grappler (kung-fu dude)<br/>Guns are a big part of the new game<br/>Demonic half-breeds (see: the console strategy game Disgaea)<br/>...and so on.<br/><br/>Also, here's my <b>Tabbit Mage-Gunner</b>:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://fujimishobo.co.jp/sw/20080808TBTF.jpg"/><br/><br/><b>Core Attributes</b><br/>Skill 8<br/>Body 5<br/>Heart 9<br/>Lifepath: Magitech<br/><br/><b>Ranks</b><br/>A 6<br/>B 6<br/>C 2<br/>D 8<br/>E 14<br/>F 8<br/><br/><b>Attributes/Bonus</b><br/>Weapons 14/2<br/>Agility 14/2<br/>Muscles 7/1<br/>Life 13/2<br/>Knowledge 23/3<br/>Spirit 17/2<br/><b><br/>Classes/Levels<br/>Shooter 1<br/>Magitech 2<br/>Sage 1</b><br/><br/><b>Languages</b><br/>Area<br/>Shinki Bunmei (written language of the gods)<br/>Madouki Bunmei (magitech machine language)<br/>1 more (Drake?)<br/><br/><b>Adventurer Level: 2</b><br/>HP 19<br/>MP 23<br/><br/><b>Combat Masteries:</b><br/>Spirit Shot (No misfires/friendly fire)<br/><b><br/>Equipment:</b><br/>Armor: Soft Leather: Protection 3, Cost 150<br/>Weaopn: Tiger Rifle: 2H, Crit 10, 30m range<br/>Weapon: Short Sword<br/><br/>Magisphere (small, required to do magitech spells): 200<br/>18 bullets<br/>10 meters of rope<br/><br/><b>Magitech spells:</b><br/>Level 1<br/>Solid Bullet<br/>Target Sight<br/>Flashlight<br/>Mana Surge<br/>Level 2<br/>Critical Bullet<br/>Shadow Body<br/>Knocker Bomb<br/>Healing Bullet (yes, you can in fact Shoot Your Friends Healthy Again)  <b>&lt;--- This is currently my favorite spell, ever.&lt;/b&gt;</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213504/#Comment_213504" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T15:17:47+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  3:17PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>but if there was a crowdsourced team, for example, I could try my hand at translating a chapter or something.</blockquote>\nConsider yourself <b>TAGGED</b>.

When I got back and saw the 4chan crowdsource, I gave up*. :-)<br/><br/>There were other issues, basically the difficulty of the SW license for an official English version** vs writing it out on paper, stapling it together, and selling it combined with copies of the Japanese books, like is done with new German Boardgame imports and the like.<br/><br/>In the end, the developer of 2.0 (Kei Kitazawa) just wants people to play and enjoy the game, his words exactly. The others at SNE nodded their heads vigorously in affirmation. So the crowdsource, while possibly not "legal" (I don't really give a shit) is pretty ethical given the desires of the publishers (which I do give a shit about). I just hope they encourage people to buy the core book from Amazon or whatever if they enjoyed the translation of the game.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>** Because the rights go back to a traditional book publisher, who are mired in BS old laws and rights management (unlike the new world of games, manga, anime etc) and thus have a vulcan death-lock on paperwork required to take a piss on a Thursday, much less the negotiation of rights for a book the size of the palm of your hand for play.<br/><br/>* (I actually got pretty far through the first book, farther than the fan translation even, but in the end I didn't want to reinvent the wheel and all).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr.%20Johnson" title="Mr. Johnson"><img alt="Mr. Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr.%20Johnson">Mr. Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331050/#Comment_331050" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T15:53:55+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  3:53PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, to be honest, it's kinda of a good thing you don't mind the whole "less-than-legal"-ness behind it.

Not to knock those guys, as they're doing all the work, but to be honest, I would like to try and start a game before I go back to college in August, and I don't think we've gotten the system to a playable point quite yet. I'm a selfish bastard like that, but I know there's been support for the system not only here, but on rpg.net and 4chan's /tg/ board, so you'd be aiding others in this venture as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, if Andy doesn't mind, I would humbly extend an offer for anyone who is able to to please assist on the project. All you would need is the motivation and free time, as everything else is provided on the front page of the wiki (scans too, though those are buried near the end of the original topic so as to avoid hosting "less-that-legal" files on the main workspace). Even if you match the current team's updating schedule, the more people we can hivemind together, the faster everything will get done, and the less work everyone will have to do. All you have to do is find the scans and do what you can.<br/>\n<br/>\n...I feel kinda dirty shilling like this, but there's rather obvious support over a great many forums, and the more places I can pull even a person or two from, the faster everything can finish up.

Heck, I've even busted out a good 42 pages' worth of rough translation, thanks to Denshi Jisho, Wikipedia, Google Translate and Rikaichan. Now sure, it may not be <i>completely</i> accurate, but that's what proofreaders are for, am I right? =P<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, as I said, it's crawling towards completion. As mentioned above, I'm shooting to get this done by the end of August (which isn't entirely unreasonable, so long as I don't slack). However, I would again like to ask for some help. Once the work on the first book finishes, there's still going to be the second and third to bang out, and I'm not sure if the current group of people will want to keep at it. And as I said before, <i>I'm</i> cranking out updates when I can, so there's really no excuse not to help out, aside from a lack of time (copy/pasting kanji and kana takes a surprisingly long time). Every little bit helps, from translating work to proofreading. It seems that the wiki has also begun to attract a blogger or two, so if you know of/write for an RPG blog, I'm sure the wiki wouldn't mind a little bit of limelight. =D<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, though, if you're interested, just go to the wiki, claim a page and go to town. Create one if you need to. We also have an IRC channel thanks to the sup/tg/ guys from 4chan, so if you have any questions, feel free to hop on and ask in real time. I'm fairly accessible, as are most of the other translators.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336903/#Comment_336903" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T17:38:19+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  5:38PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep at it, man!
