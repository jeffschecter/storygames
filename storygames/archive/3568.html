I'd love to see stuff like:<br/>\n<br/>\n- How does a open democracy deal with right to privacy and the rise of AI?<br/>\n- Can a decentralized volunteer militia fend off a larger invading force without sacrificing its values?<br/>\n- Can the academic police state be the first to discover (Technology X) first?<br/>\n- Does your global software empire still matter in an age of free information?<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, you could play some very short stories with your organization/protagonist, change the world a bit more, and repeat to see the evolution of things. I can see a few ways of setting up a story this way in Shock: (well, aside from just doing it with vanilla shock).<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) Praxes hacking<br/>\n<br/>\nChange up the praxes in between stories. This will reflect the change in the world. (So you define the ways an organization has power by the praxes. If your praxis is "corporate capitalism vs state capitalism", it says that in this current world the raw power of your "participatory economics" won't get you anywhere in a conflict.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(2) New Axis: Power<br/>\n<br/>\nAdding a new axis to the world grid, so it becomes a 3d grid of Shock vs Issue vs Power, where "Power" defines the domain where your organization is working in or struggling. You add or remove these domains in between stories, to show that changing landscape of the world. So you add "Power: Naval Supremacy" in the age of exploration, and later on you add "Power: Global Trade", "Power: Colonization" and "Power: Resistance". Then, you'd remove "Power: Naval Supremacy" to assert that influence there means little without the others. Your stories might take place on an intersection of all 3 axes, or perhaps just on any 2 of the 3.<br/>\n<br/>\n(3) New Grid: Power vs Values<br/>\n<br/>\nWe put Protagonists on the Issue vs Shock grid, and in parallel put your organization on a new grid, where organizations are defined as the intersection between Power and Values (and, the organization's location on the grid can change over time). Similar to above, world changes allow the creation of new values and powers. So, "Value: Solidarity", "Value: Control", "Value: The Individual", "Value: Democracy". So stories take place on the intersection of the Shock/Issue grid and the Power/Value grid.<br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other suggestions or thoughts here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80426/#Comment_80426" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T13:58:24+00:00" title="July 10, 2007  1:58PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you need to add a new grid, just allowing organisations to be protags might be enough. <br/><br/>In terms of changes to the world based on stories, that could be based on how each group went with regard to their story goals.<br/><br/>I'm skeptical that Shock: is the best idea for replicating the games you mention - it is designed to be great at doing the stories of individuals in those situations, but that works in opposition to the building-up style that is the central focus of god-games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The caveat I'd add is that the first Feature of that organization should be a person. Otherwise, you get all detached, and Shock: would work <em>very</em> poorly as a straight-up strategy game. Difficult choices are only interesting if you care viscerally about which way something falls.</p>\n<p>Changing Praxis between stories is standard procedure.</p>\n<p>Adding a second grid seems overly complicated. I think you'd be better served by using Minuti\xc3\xa6; that way, they'll have mechanical kick. Just make the Minuti\xc3\xa6 detailed. You can have a bunch of Minuti\xc3\xa6 laid out as a conspiracy chart, a relationship map, a power heirarchy, whatever*. They're a world building tool.</p>\n<p>Adding a third axis to the regular Grid does something interesting: it gives players on the same crux an inherent difference in initial Situation.That's pretty neat. A 3D Grid seems hard to represent, though; I think the way to do it is, agree that all of the Issues have to do with, I dunno, Economic Well-being and the different Issues are heirarchies in the power structure. Like, "Political elite" "Merchant class" "Working poor" and "Poverty"</p>\n<p>* I've never said this out loud, but holy shit, this is important and I never realized it before.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
