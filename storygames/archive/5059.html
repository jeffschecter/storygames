In order to avoid making assumptions, this is how one my CoC sessions would go:<br/><br/>GM: You get shot in the gut, you lose 5 hit points(enter description, blablabla)<br/>Player1: Shit, I only have like 5HP left. I better not get hit again.<br/>Fight ends, players win against bad guys.<br/><br/>This is how I want it to go:<br/>GM: You get shot in the gut. It hurts alot but you can see no blood. There's just a small hole where the bullet went in.<br/>Player1: Shit. Why is there no blood? Is this bad?<br/>Player2: Better help him, I have first aid skills. <br/>GM: Roll First Aid. (Rolls, succeeds)You lift him off the ground and see that there's a wound on his back and he's bleeding. You don't know how bad he is but you manage to stop the bleeding for now.<br/>Fight ends, players win.<br/>Player2: We better take him to the hospital, I don't know if he'll make it.<br/><br/>Basically, a health system where players can't tell how badly they're hurt(like in real life) except if they have a related skill that can possibly help them. And rules for bleeding.<br/>Does this sound cool or is it like common knowledge that this is how you're supposed to play out wounding in story games?<br/><br/>-George                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113964/#Comment_113964" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T23:04:44+00:00" title="December 12, 2007 11:04PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2007 11:05PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unknown Armies does something like that, but only halfway.

I have no idea how to tackle that, right now. It's just that I'm making a horror game and getting stabbed should be fucking horrific, not shrugged off. I think it will create a more dramatic game and possibly add some urgency(first aid skills actually matter, player afraid for character's life) to fights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113970/#Comment_113970" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T23:22:33+00:00" title="December 12, 2007 11:22PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>first aid skills actually matter</blockquote>\nI'm just gonna through this out there, because the idea struck when reading those five words:  first aid isn't about saving someone -- it's about saving someone <em>at a cost of time</em>.

But then, maybe not.  I do like that it makes field first aid a bit more like what it is -- a way to keep you around long enough to get to a hospital/surgeon, not a cure for being wounded.  Though, it seems like the system would encourage people to get larger wounds, as they would last longer -- 10 red tokens + 10 black tokens = between 6 and 20 draws before death, depending on first aid.  10 red + 5 black = 5 to 15 draws before death.  (Of course, the ratio is more favorable for the latter from being incapacitated.)  I would probably change it to "Run out of red stones and you're dead."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114073/#Comment_114073" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T10:05:15+00:00" title="December 13, 2007 10:05AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think any game that places heavy importance on wounding, wound management, and (especially) life-saving is ultimately going to be about those things.

But wouldn't it be simpler to have character health be represented by a pool and then just draw from that? Black tokens are wounds and red ones beeing bleeding.<br/>So when a character is wounded, you pull one(or 2, depending on severity) black token and a few red ones. Each round after that with no first aid you pull red tokens as needed.

The pulling of beads is random, so there's missing information that causes tension -- it's not just a game of playing subtraction.  Maybe instead of that, it could be the case that what you want is for the players to not be certain how much more punishment they can take, looking at it from the other side.  If that's the case, knowing the punishment they've taken could craft a feel you're looking for, because one isn't able to determine from that information alone.<br/><br/>There is also a sense of wincing and horror when people in this sort of mechanic are handed a bunch of black tokens -- they know how badly they just got hurt in a tangible-to-the-player way as they dump those beads into their bag.  I've seen some UA games fall flat because the GM didn't narrate the severity of the wound enough or over-did it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114084/#Comment_114084" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T10:30:33+00:00" title="December 13, 2007 10:30AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, Ryan's right - this would <i>function </i>with a deck of cards, but I think you really need to <i>reach into the bag.</i>  Trust Paul's instincts!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114085/#Comment_114085" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T10:30:49+00:00" title="December 13, 2007 10:30AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey George,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>But wouldn't it be simpler to have character health be represented by a pool and then just draw from that?

Spending against a known pool isn't tense. Drawing against an unknown pool is. The player should only know the number of red stones in the bag...not the number of black stones representing wound threat/quality. And allow the character to take action whenever there are an accumulation of more red stones showing than black ones, at the cost of a two stone pull. So if they're healthy relative to the wound/threat quality they can keep acting, but there's always a chance they'll end up dead at the end.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114087/#Comment_114087" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T10:32:27+00:00" title="December 13, 2007 10:32AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, you give the wound a severity rating, a number, and have the player roll against it at appropriate times.

Instead of beads and a bag, I have a straw-drawing mechanic with painted lines around the center of wooden sticks.  When dealing with a scene about resisting temptation, you have three black straws and a number of white straws equal to your Will.  You draw from that one or more times, depending on what's going on, and you deal with the situation presented by the draws.  Here's the kicker -- you want white straws drawn because that means you're less likely to hurt someone, <em>but</em> you take out any white straws drawn from the system.  That's your will being sapped away in all these little battles.  You always have three black straws, though, because the Evil is relentless.  Eventually, if you don't get some "mental first aid" from the support group, you're going to run out and succumb to the Evil.<br/><br/>With that in mind, maybe you wouldn't want to take black tokens out of the system without first aid -- you draw a black token, have to deal with being incapacitated by your wound, and put that black token back in the bag.  After all, you're still wounded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114098/#Comment_114098" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T10:52:07+00:00" title="December 13, 2007 10:52AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we play TSoY we use glass beads to represent bonus dice and there's one - out of like 60 - that's a different color.

A good read. Though I earlier started a thread about combat in horror games in general, I think in some ways damage is my biggest single concern.<br/><br/>The problems as I see it are that:<br/><br/>(i) a horror game should feel dangerous, but constantly having to start again with a new character is a pain.<br/>(ii) taking damage should feel gritty and realistic, but the system needs to be rapid and not too complicated.<br/>(iii) damage should have lasting consequences, but playing a character who has essentially been crippled for the next 6 months is not most people's idea of fun. <br/><br/>I'm attracted to the idea of players not having perfect information in horror combat, or at least there being a trade-off between information and other concerns. So a system that can do what George proposes would be very interesting, I think. I'm not sure about Paul's suggestion. I mean, it's brilliant (as usual), but maybe a touch too elaborate for what it achieves? For me, if you're going to have special equipment for something, it probably ought to be the core of the game, not just something that might sometimes happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114674/#Comment_114674" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-16T18:18:40+00:00" title="December 16, 2007  6:18PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Dave. <br/>Although I'm not sure I will be using this mechanic, I'm assuming I will, while working on the game. Your three concerns are accurate, but the way I'm seeing things, they're unavoidable since this is how any wounding system would work in my game. I <b>want</b> players to feel that combat is deadly and has consequences. I want getting shot in a session to leave a long lasting impression and have dramatic impact. In that sense, Paul's idea does just that, I just need to alter it a bit to fit my needs and style.<br/>But I won't say no to a different mechanic that might be perfect for someone else or even for a more ''lite'' version of my game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
