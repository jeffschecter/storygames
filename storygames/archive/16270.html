The tweaks are simple, we just stole scene mechanics from BE, every character gets a Color, Interstitial, and a Interlude or Action scene (one action scene per side). <br/><br/>The players made their Heroes, and then they also made a Villain to play. They play the villain like any other character all of them taking turns resolving their scenes. It is working great and keeps the flow moving well. <br/><br/>Have you guys tried something like this before? I am generally opposed to PvP, but the way this works out makes it function so well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
