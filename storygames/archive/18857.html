I live in South Korea where printing and shipping books is really, really cheap so I was wondering if designers and publishers out there had any interest in something I was thinking of starting up. This is obviously just in the brainstorming phase but what I was thinking was something along these lines:<br/><br/>1. When a designer/publisher wants to set up international fulfillment for a kickstarter or some such thing, they contact me.<br/>2. I set them up with some printers in Korea that have representatives that speak English so they can get their own quotes and do all that action. All of the stuff with the printer can still be handled by them, the designer and publisher, since their English is usually pretty good (I could help out when/if necessary). I can also send along proofs to the states when it comes, take pictures from here in Korea and give my impressions in addition.<br/>3. When setting up where to ship the books, you just have them send it to me, via domestic shipping and I handle fulfillment after you send me the list of names and addresses to ship to, providing documentation, invoices and such for shipping materials and the cost of shipments, with costs of such thing all being given up front. I'm not really sure how I'd work this, but I'd get some form of payment for my services.<br/><br/>This could be something publishers do for just international orders, but I've also found lately that shipping from Korea (normal air mail, 10-14 days) to America is actually cheaper than domestic shipping in country! So it might be even easier (re:cheaper) for me to handle virtually all fulfillment, and then any surplus could be arranged to be sent to the states perhaps.<br/><br/><br/>So I only have my <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1858774754/magicians-a-language-learning-rpg" rel="nofollow">Magicians kickstarter</a> to base the numbers off of, but here are the numbers to see if it'd be worth it for publishers and designers to try doing it this way - printing and shipping from South Korea. I sent books to a ton of countries all over the world but I'll focus on America for obvious reason (and because it's one of the more expensive places to ship to from Korea, compared to Europe and Asia).<br/><br/>I got 1,200 copies of Magicians printed in Korea, which ended up costing me about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$2,685 USD</span> (Korean won = \u20a92,880,000) &lt;6x9, black and white, 212 page softcover&gt;<br/>To ship one book, via printed media air mail, costs less than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$6 USD</span> (Korean won about \u20a96,000)<br/>For packing materials, I paid about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$28 USD</span> (Korean won = \u20a930,000) for every 100 items (Safety envelopes with bubble wrap inside them).<br/>Domestic shipping for the books, from printing house to mine cost me less than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$30 USD</span> for all 1,200 books (Korean won = \u20a930,000)<br/><br/><br/>As far as I can tell, it costs about $10 to ship a book of Magicians size (6x9 softcover, 212 pages) from point A to point B within the United States, so it's actually cheaper to send a book from Korea, though you probably have to wait a bit longer.<br/><br/>I'd love to be able to provide fulfillment, especially international, but to whomever to get some awesome games that seem to be less and less available to us international folks. But you guys tell me! Do you think it's a viable option that you, as publishers and game designers, would be interested in and use?<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlpoccDDmi0ldHJicnZ3QjItdVlIVkxHeENXZGlmY3c&amp;usp=sharing#gid=0" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Here's a spreadsheet for comparisons for cost of printing and shipping.</b></span></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422274/#Comment_422274" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T17:55:12+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  5:55PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's interesting in principle.

For that, I might well go with a company which has worked well for others, rather than someone new. Track record probably trumps cost saving.<br/><br/>Still, it does make me think about the possibility of centralised shipping from abroad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422275/#Comment_422275" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T18:34:37+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  6:34PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2013 6:54PM by kksimons.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, that makes a lot of sense, I guess I'd need some enterprising people to put their faith and trust in me so that I could actually get a track record going! I'd of course get contracts drawn up and such, but when it comes down to it, it'd definitely require a lot of trust from a first timer.<br/><br/>I was thinking an interesting way to do it might be to calculate how much you'd save on using this process of fulfillment through myself and then I would take a percentage of that figure as payment. Mostly I'm just seeing if it's viable and if people would be interested in it before I go about trying to start it up as an actual thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422277/#Comment_422277" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T19:01:23+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  7:01PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ordinary fulfillment relies on long-term stability, yes. However, i understood that Kyle was thinking of doing short burst projects, something where he'd take care of the crowdfunding fulfillment and then send the rest of the print run wherever for the long tail market. Theoretically you'd need to rely on Kyle for merely a couple of weeks, or a couple of months on the outside.<br/><br/>Of course the liabilities involved are necessarily pretty large. I suspect that you, Kyle, would need to explicitly take a pretty large share of the risks involved in doing something like this for people to be willing to partner up; if your part in e.g. a shipping disaster or house fire that ruins half a print run is that of a mere consultant, a publisher working with you might even find themselves in a legally weakened position compared to more ordinary arrangements. Just to pick an arbitrary example, you might end up in a situation where you, Kyle, were the only party capable of litigating against a printer or shipping company, while your partner would be the party actually suffering damages; this could lead into a situation where it is not in your interests to actually pursue such litigation, which might leave your partner incapable of protecting themselves against whatever the original unfortunate event was.<br/><br/>Continuing with the obvious train of thought, it's clear that the persnickety details can be figured out, given sufficient motivation. However, once that has been done, it seems to me that Kyle will have developed a legitimate intermediate business agency for foreign investment into Korean publishing industry <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> I mean, surely there are already companies working in this field? At least here in Finland there are, indeed, companies whose entire business is about facilitating foreign business desiring to operate in Finland. And I know that I've seen Internet-dwelling companies that focus on providing printing &amp; shipping services originating in China.<br/><br/>Which is of course not to say that it's a bad idea - clearly it's a good one, considering that others are already doing it. However, it's also a pretty serious and dull one (dull as in work, I mean), I suspect, so if you were thinking of doing something fun related to roleplaying, then this might prove a challenging proposition. The key question is balancing the liability issue against the fun stuff: is it possible to do this sort of thing at a relatively informal garage-punk level (where things are still fun) without running into the sort of fuckfest that occasionally happens when indie hippies try to make things just a little bit too simple?<br/><br/>Also, an observation on a higher level of abstraction: if it is cheaper to ship to the US from Korea than from the US, one would expect this to be caused by some sort of subsidy, rather than natural logistical costs. This means that your business idea is vulnerable to political changes over a longer time period. This well might be another good reason to focus on burst fulfillment over long tail warehousing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422279/#Comment_422279" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T19:36:19+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  7:36PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely great points, I agree. I was thinking more along the lines of burst fulfillment, as it wouldn't require me renting out additional space and warehousing and all that additional, logistical stuff. I was mostly thinking of kickstarter fulfillment to be precise, where a surplus of books would probably either continue on to the states to be sold by other parties, or maybe just as a POD product. <br/><br/>I think it's safe to say that international fulfillment from kickstarters is becoming a less viable, if not far less desirable option, than it has in the past, so I conceived of more to fill that need. Also, like you said, things can change pretty quick (like shipping in the states this year), so I was definitely thinking of taking on a single project at a time rather than an ongoing storefront-type situation. I don't have the resources at the moment to consider something like that in any case, it'd require a lot more logistics and capital.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422413/#Comment_422413" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T04:37:34+00:00" title="October  4, 2013  4:37AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I asked around and got some quotes for book printing in both 6x9 and 8x11 and put together some info about shipping prices for anyone who might be curious. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlpoccDDmi0ldHJicnZ3QjItdVlIVkxHeENXZGlmY3c&amp;usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Click here to check it out</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422414/#Comment_422414" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T05:19:29+00:00" title="October  4, 2013  5:19AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would so love to use you for this, because that's really cheap, but I'm probably going for a whole box with dice, tokens and maps, and not just a book.

That was pretty murderous on my hand. The shipping figures on the chart assume printed papers shipping unless otherwise noted (when it gets on the heavier side). Even regular air isn't particularly expensive but it's always nice to save some cash if you can. <br/><br/>As for doing boxes and dice and all manner of trinkets and stuff it'd probably be beyond my scope, yeah; tracking down and finding places to sell all that stuff. If you weighed it I could find shipping quotes but you'd have to get it to me first so I'm not sure if it'd be worthwhile at all.
