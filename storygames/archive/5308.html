In our (I have a partner) system we have a stat called WPR that allows a character to have will-points (hero-points if you are more familiar with this term).  The idea behind the will-points is for characters to spend them in order to perform a heroic action that they otherwise would not have been able to do.  Unfortunately, during play testing, everyone has used it as a dump-stat.  Is there a way that we can encourage players to make use of this avenue in the interest of not only game balance, but also for interesting play.  We would like to avoid having specific bonuses like "spend a will-point and receive +5 to attack" but still have a system in place to help out the GM and not force a game that is otherwise a numbers game into a freeform mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119408/#Comment_119408" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T08:17:48+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  8:17AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried this once with similar results.  The reason for it is what rules do in the game - if the rest of the rules provide a baseline of agreement about how things work, the players will gravitate towards that because of what's under their control.  <br/><br/>The will points that you describe are freeform but more importantly there's no clear line between what they CAN do with them and what they CAN'T do with them.  So players will put their resources into controllable elements.<br/><br/>Does your game have character advancement?  If it does you could tie advancement to the use of those points - if it were d20 you could halve XP rewards but grant 100 XP each time a PC uses an action point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/outsider" title="outsider"><img alt="outsider" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/outsider">outsider</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119409/#Comment_119409" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T08:27:35+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  8:27AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the quick response.

Some chose to make it neutral, which was technically putting something in to it.  They knew how they worked, they just chose other avenues.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul,<br/>\nNow, I think I know what you mean by enduring, but correct me if I'm wrong.  For example in D&amp;D, if there was a WPR score of 16 they would a +3 mod.  Does that mean that you would use that mod (+3) as a misc. bonus to a certain action(s)?  If so, that wasn't really what we were going for, that I imagine would simply lead to power gaming. Not that I have anything against power gaming, but that\u2019s what we have the other ability scores for.  I guess it depends on the player.  A player that is used to free-forming would be more inclined to take it.  Our players may just not be free form style players, but if there is someone out there is, the system has a character option for them.  I just want to facilitate this.  A few ideas I was thinking about:<br/>\n<br/>\nWP becomes more powerful when things are really on the line (low HP, party-members dying)<br/>\nWP becomes more powerful when they are oriented in a meaningful way with a predefined background related trigger.  (You get super pissed and flip out when someone hits a girl, taunts your family name, [nothing too broad obviously])<br/>\nWP becomes more powerful when the action taken creates meaningful character interaction (I don't even know what this would entail but it sounds nice)<br/>\nWP becomes more powerful when you describe really well the action taking place. (Although this is tricky b/c the player may think he did a good job and demand a reward when he sucked, I'd probably give it to him anyway)<br/>\nWP becomes more powerful when fighting favored enemy or alignment<br/>\nEtc..<br/>\n<br/>\nWP should be encouraged in such a way that it makes a scene \u201cmore dramatic.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI,<br/>\nWe were imaging the points refreshing 1/day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Ron, Paul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119535/#Comment_119535" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T19:04:30+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  7:04PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't refresh the points 1/day if you want people to use them. <i>Take them away</i> at the rate of 1/day (if none are spent) if you want people to use them.

Although the difficulty I imagined is having them build a character that has them in the first place.  If they have them, I assume they will use them, or they will be drastically underpowered.  Game balance is also an issue.  If I start taking them away, then the other characters focusing on other areas will out shine them in key fights because the WPR character saved his points for the BBEG instead of using them on the minions the previous day.  This is an issue that the GM will have to consider, to construct situations that allow a character to use his points and also make sure that when he does use them, they can have a meaningful impact.  Otherwise, you're right, sitting on them is boring and poor role-playing so maybe he should be penalized.

They're a constant asset to the character's effectiveness. Whereas WPR is something that gets spent, and so the player might find himself in the position of not having it when he really needs it. If you were to redesign the game so the stats like STR and DEX (or whatever) were also spendable resources (like WPR), then the player would be deciding during chargen between allocating character effectiveness to the ordinary human actions scoped by DEX and STR, and the extraordinary actions scoped by WPR. And the same is true if you were to redesign so WPR was not a spendable resource, as you suggest, giving a +3 or whatever to actions beyond human. In neither case would WPR be a dump stat. Players would invest in it based on the concept they had for their character.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119542/#Comment_119542" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T19:33:55+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  7:33PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it is hard to make suggestions without knowing anything much about your system, but maybe WPR could be a derived stat the way health, endurance and essence are in Unisystem; that is, generated using a formula based on the other some of the  stats (like Charisma + Willpower / 2, to make up an example at random), which means that they are only indirectly selected.

Not only that, I guess it doesn't really even belong on this board since it is in no way a "Story Game."  I have a confession to make, I've never played a story-game.  (please don't ban me :-)  My group is a great set of guys with the occasional female and we have always placed great emphasis on story, both personally for the character and as a whole for the adventure.  The system itself is basically a glorified D&amp;D.  (Although we like to think fundamentally different, way better, and marketably so)  What I think you guys would call an Awesom-o-fied version.  The longer we work on it the less it resembles D&amp;D though.  We already have a game mechanic for WPR, we just need to write into the "Book of Rules" examples and guided help for players that will be making WPR based characters.  The spending of WP will always be a GM arbitrated ability that will "simply do something cool" but we were aiming at a more professional and encouraging description that will present the WPR character as a viable option that won't suck or get the player killed every time.  I'm super excited about the system in general, and I would love to have some of you guys look it over and find its weaknesses.  However, we only have recently play-tested for the first time and we haven't even scratched the surface of a workable magic system. So I don't think its quite ready to unveil just yet.  We speculate by the end of the coming summer it will be wrapped and ready to ship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119559/#Comment_119559" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T21:32:06+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  9:32PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2008 9:33PM by Kuma.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WPR is likely a dump stat because it's more advantageous to have high stats that are going to stay high (like Paul said), than to put points into a stat that you're going to wind up spending away.<br/><br/>For example, if I had the choice (in D&amp;D, mind) between a 14 and a 16 in a stat and 1 or 3 Hero Points, I'd take the 16 because that 16 is always going to be there for me.  The Hero point might be gone in the first session, for all I know.<br/><br/>One way to loosen up spending Hero points is to tie them to advancement.  If you use your WPR points in combat, you get a price cut on spending your advancement currency on your swordsmanship, for example.  If you use them in Diplomatic wrangling with the Princess, you get a price break on Charisma.  The more points you spend, the more price breaks you get, and they stack.

There's some good examples of this mechanic out there and lots of different ways to earn/spend them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: outsider</cite>WP becomes more powerful when things are really on the line (low HP, party-members dying)</blockquote>\nIf the points can only be used to do Awesome, and you get the perfect mix between scarcity and abundance, I think its possible the players will automatically use them only when things are at their most dire. You may or may not have to stat this effect in the system. One way to handle this is to make WP something that the player whips out when it really really matters (cheating death, re-rolling a failure, getting a one time benefit in a roll). This lets the player decide whats really important to them and also communicates that import to the GM ("He's spending WP. This must really matter.")\n<blockquote>WP becomes more powerful when they are oriented in a meaningful way with a predefined background related trigger.  (You get super pissed and flip out when someone hits a girl, taunts your family name, [nothing too broad obviously])<br/>WP becomes more powerful when the action taken creates meaningful character interaction (I don't even know what this would entail but it sounds nice)</blockquote>\nVery cool. However, I'm a bit confused as to how your system differentiates between more powerful and less powerful WP. My understanding is that you're shying away from a formulaic bonus like WP = +5 but also that you are trying not to make it "freeform." Youv'e said \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: outsider</cite>The spending of WP will always be a GM arbitrated ability that will "simply do something cool"</blockquote>\nbut, what is the mechanical difference between "something cool" and "something more powerfully cool" in-game?\n<blockquote>WP becomes more powerful when you describe really well the action taking place. (Although this is tricky b/c the player may think he did a good job and demand a reward when he sucked, I'd probably give it to him anyway)</blockquote>Some games do something similar and reward good roleplay with awarding or refreshing hero points, as opposed to making them more powerful.\n<blockquote>WP becomes more powerful when fighting favored enemy or alignment</blockquote>\nThis looks to me to be just one specific kind of "predefined background related triggers."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119634/#Comment_119634" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T08:00:32+00:00" title="January 15, 2008  8:00AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don,<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be missing something here, or oversimplifying things, so please forgive me if that's the case:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou want players to use these points.  They're used to do awesome stuff.  So players either need them in order to do awesome stuff, or they help a lot when someone wants to bring the awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why are you giving the players the option of not buying any?  Why not just give them a set number to spend at character creation?  The players you've been testing with appear to be saying "I don't really want to interact with this bit of the rules".  You need to say "You WILL interact with these rules, they rock".<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan's idea of making a reward of some kind (XP) tie into the spending of these points is one I like.  A couple of other games do that (7th Sea iirc, for all it's faults, does).  If it's a willpower stat, maybe you can tie earning the points to achievements of some kind?  Like when a character achieves something in line with one of his goals, they earn a point of WPR.  Needn't be anything massive, just, say, if a character hates the baron then anything he does which sets back the baron's plans earns him points.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can think of a lot of games which use this type of mechanic, are you interested in a reading list?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119638/#Comment_119638" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T08:11:56+00:00" title="January 15, 2008  8:11AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2008 8:12AM by Ry.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don, how would you feel if people suggested a few links to some really good guides on game design?

I\u2019m kind of a cheap bastard and I refuse to download illegal copies, especially of independent work (as opposed to D&amp;D which I would feel less guilty about in theory).<br>\n<br>\nPosted By: noclue If the points can only be used to do Awesome, and you get the perfect mix between scarcity and abundance, I think its possible the players will automatically use them only when things are at their most dire. <br>\n<br/>\nHow I was imagining it was that Characters on, lets say, a multi-day journey to a dragons den on which they have to face things like giant spiders, goblins, etc. (the Hobbit)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the WPR character is going to be balanced, he has to be able to use his WP on the spiders and goblins as well as the dragon.  Otherwise, the barbarian in the party gets all the glory during normal combat and out of nowhere, the useless guy gets super-powerful against the BBEG.  This happens in anime all the time, but is this convincing story telling?  I think that these two character types can be likened to track runners.  The barbarian is like the long distance (sounds like an oxymoron!) runner who is pretty good all the time, while the WPR character is good in short bursts, lets say (3 times per day WPR 16) like the sprinter.  However, these short bursts are as integral to the character as the barbarians HP or his sword.  I want the player who uses it, to be able to use it somewhat consistently, but in certain situations, really shine (This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the BBEG, again focus on character, albeit background related or whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted By: noclue Some games do something similar and reward good roleplay with awarding or refreshing hero points, as opposed to making them more powerful. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of the WP becoming more potent and meaningful instead of more often since the whole purpose of the WP is to make actions more meaningful story-wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player will not be able to rely solely on his WP.  Like every other character, overspecialization leaves one vulnerable or useless in certain situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted By: noclue what is the mechanical difference between "something cool" and "something more powerfully cool" in-game? <br/>\n<br/>\nAy, there's the rub, to make objective something that is subjective.  Now this is where I thought the story-games board would have the most insight.  From what I gather, story-games are those in which certain mechanics are used to structure, force progression (I don\u2019t know what word to use here since I am utterly unfamiliar with story-games) of the stories which make up the game.  Now for me, WPR should be a story driven phenomenon and therefore different from other actions that get things like +5.  The +5 combined with dice is the resolution mechanic to see if something happens.  I was hoping that there was a story-game out there that had a sort of resolution mechanic that involved the progression of the story.  So for instance, if the BBEG was intimately linked with the character\u2019s background or is a rival, then the character should be the one who lands the last and most potent blow.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I remember some time ago reading about a mechanic that differentiated between personal success and party success. Maybe the ordinary form of WP should affect a personal success and the more powerful version affecting party success.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames, thanks for your post, it helped me clarify my questions and ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\nRich<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it\u2019s like that.  WPR is going to be like \u201cthe mundane magic\u201d if such a thing can exist.  There is a separate mechanic for magic that interacts closely with WPR, but is distinguished from it.  (You don\u2019t spend WP to cast spells for instance, but certain aspects of magic will be based on your WPR score)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I would love a reading list.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I would greatly appreciate that.  The D&amp;D stuff not so much because we are so far from D&amp;D now.  The concept of ability scores affecting rolls.  That's all the similarity as of now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the comments guys.

Specifically the stuff about FATE points.  There are several uses for them, and the way they are handled is pretty interesting.  I think that might be somewhat along the lines of what you're meaning. (some powers are fuelled by them for example).  Not that I'm saying it's the same ort anything, just worth looking at.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to look at is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow">The Shadow Of Yesterday</a>.  There's a mechanic called Gift Dice in that one which is pretty cool.  Also the way Keys work is a great example of forcing people to play the game the way you want by offering rewards.  In this case, people pick personality traits they want and get XP for playing them up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there's free versions of commercial games:<br/>\n<br/>\nSavage Worlds has a mechanic called Bennies, which are very mechanical.  Not really what you're talking about in a lot of ways, but interesting and worth reading up on.  I've seen a lot of fan drifts of how these work to make them more interesting, but anyway...  There's a free <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.peginc.com/Games/SavageWorlds/Downloads/TestDrive.pdf" rel="nofollow">Test Drive Edition</a> of the Savage Worlds rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther stuff:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Buffy RPG uses something called Drama Points.  It's a pretty popular game and while I'm not sure if there's a free preview I'm sure someone on the main forum of RPGNet (or this forum) would be happy to explain the basics of how Drama Points work.  I seem to remember that they could be used for halving the damage you take from an attack (by saying "it's not as bad as it looks") and for finding useful items which might be around (like an axe when you need one, or a handy wooden pole when you need to steak a vampire)<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimetime Adventures has a great and simple currency mechanic called "Fanmail".  Basically players award it to each other when they think someone has done something cool.  it can be spent for a pretty straightforward but powerful mechanical bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat'll probably get you going, I'm sure other people have more and better suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/outsider" title="outsider"><img alt="outsider" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/outsider">outsider</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119819/#Comment_119819" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T05:32:17+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  5:32AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Rich!

For instance, if you say, "You spend your WP and the GM decides something awesome happens," well, that is no guarantee that it will be useful at all is it? A lot of GMs think its awesome when the PCs are addicted to crack and have to decide between money for food and money for crack... And if you say, "When something really matters to you, spend the WP, then roll and you will get X bonus," the problem with this idea is that most of the things that matter to the player, their PC is already good at. A guy who cares about how fighty his char is is going to make a char that has high fighty skills, stats, etc. So they aren't going to know before the roll if they need it or not and will want to save that point until they "really" need it...<br>\n  I had this same issue, and the solution I opted with was, allow the players to negotiate what the point does. And allow the character a chance to spend it after the roll and everything has gone to hell...<br>\n  You may not like that option, but I can tell you that my group really used that mechanic extensively and effectively for over a year.<br>\n  Whatever you decide, good luck man!<br>\nDave M<br>\nAuthor of Legends of Lanasia (Still in Beta)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/outsider" title="outsider"><img alt="outsider" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/outsider">outsider</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120038/#Comment_120038" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T20:28:24+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  8:28PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SotC looks awesome.

When I said Glorified D&amp;D, I was referencing the fact that it is still only concerned with the simulation of combat and not a story game.  For the the GNS people out there, a gamist/simulationist game.  Please excuse my apparent contradictions.  Good to see that you're paying attention though :-)  <br>\n<br>\n"Raising the stakes" has great ideas (it should be bundled with every D&amp;D book), and I think it can quickly add a Narrativist feel to what was strictly a Gamist system.  I like it.  This ultimately is my goal.  WPR is aiming to be a mechanic that adds a narrativist feel to what is ultimately a gamist/simulationist system.  (Even though some would say that trying to accomplish all three or even more than one is bad system design)  This is very useful, thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you are right.  Having a character that has an ability that forces you to lose control of the character is not exciting.  However, allowing the player to decide is also dangerous because of immature players (if you have an immature GM, then this mechanic will be the least of your problems).  That is why they have rules like "reroll" or "add +5" in order to eliminate the subjective element, and therefore the factor of immaturity.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow is it possible to eliminate the factor of immaturity without eliminating subjectivity?  <br/>\nFirst option would be to relativize the subjectivism.  A Veto system.  Say for instance the player can narrate how ever he wants to, but is subject to the GM and the other players.  But of course this isn't fool-proof, I mean look at the U.N. and China.  I can imagine this getting out of hand...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option would be to objectivize the subjectivism.  For now the distinction between personal success and party success seems to somewhat cover this.  I\u2019m thinking about adding another distinction of severity.  (This isn't what always happens, but an example)<br/>\n<br/>\nMinor success\t\t  You automatically land a blow<br/>\nSuccess\t\t             The blow is particularly good<br/>\nMajor success\t           The blow has an affect on the opponent\u2019s ability to continue fighting<br/>\nMinor Party success\tThe blow instantly destroys/ causes death to the opponent<br/>\nParty success\t\t   The death has an impact on the tide of the battle<br/>\nMajor party success\tThe death directly leads to the overall victory on the battlefield (general, leader, standard bearer, <br/>\n                                   etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo objective categories can still allow the player to describe a variety of actions, but not kill the BBEG in one hit.  And of course they can always \u201craise the stake\u201d and go for a higher success.<br/>\n<br/>\nRon,<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat idea.  I will definitely include special actions that can be made only with WP, like knocking someone across the room.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120168/#Comment_120168" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T13:29:49+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  1:29PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some possible mechanical effects for WP-like points:<br/>1.

Leave the addressing of player problems where it belongs: among players.

I wanted to make a psionics system, without writing descriptions of every possible psionic power out there. So I did this:<br/>\nPsionics:<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a simple system for Psionics and it works great! Psionics is Empathy-based. In order to have a Psionic Power you must forfeit you Special Ability (Psionics are pretty Special as far as I'm concerned). The effectiveness of your Psionics depends on the scope of the power:<br/>\n<br/>\nBroad Powers<br/>\n<br/>\n  These are not real powerful, generally the player must make a second check after exerting their broad-based power. For instance the character with Telekinesis +5 would have to first make a skill check with there Telekinesis (EMP+5) and if that succeeded, would have to make a brawling roll with Ref and Brawling to "Punch" someone with their Telekinetic powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples of Broad-based powers:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Telekinesis<br/>\n<br/>\n    Telepathy<br/>\n<br/>\n    Clairvoyance (i.e., distant sight)<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvanced Powers<br/>\n<br/>\n  These powers are limited in scope, but still can generally effect most situations. Many times the Advanced power will be a contested roll against whatever defense the target can muster. In this way his powers are not guaranteed to succeed every time. For example the character with Pyrokinesis (power over Fire) +5 throwing a fireball at a character could be contested by: Athletics, Martial Arts, Dodge &amp; Escape, or perhaps another Psionic Power. Whatever the target chose to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Pyrokinesis<br/>\n<br/>\n    Empathy<br/>\n<br/>\n    Clairvoyance (defined as seeing the future)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Levitation<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecialized Powers<br/>\n<br/>\n  These powers affect a very narrow scope, and consequently are more powerful than the other two categories. Generally, the Referee will decide what, if any, defenses a target can use in a given use of a power. Example, The character with Stun Bolt +5 bolts an oncoming Solo. The referee examines the different factors and decides that since the Solo is running towards the Psionic character his only defense is Psionic (tough break for the solo, huh?), so the Psionic rolls and adds EMP+5 and the Solo rolls and adds EMP-2 (he still has his Combat Sense)<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Fire Bolt<br/>\n<br/>\n    Animal Telepathy<br/>\n<br/>\n    Clairvoyance (defined as Seeing the future through the eyes of another)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Flight<br/>\n<br/>\n  These are, of course, only examples and the player\u2019s power should be limited only by their imagination. With the sliding scale I have built into the system even Munchkins who ask for Nuclear Blast +10 are shut down, because first they will have to make a Psionics skill check (hope they don't like Cyberware), then anyone that is targeted by them gets to use their best skill to dodge.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Visibility not required: -1L<br/>\n<br/>\n    Automatic: -1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Power does not require an action to activate<br/>\n<br/>\n    Aptitude (+ to rolls): -1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        The plus should be based on the power (maybe athletics for telekinesis)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisadvantage:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Exhausting (Risk Required) +1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Character makes a stun save after each use<br/>\n<br/>\n    Physically Draining: +1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Character takes damage points after each use<br/>\n<br/>\n    Mentally Draining: +1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Character takes humanity loss after each use<br/>\n<br/>\n    Material Required: +1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Power has some sort of component or reagent necessary to activate (maybe matches for pyrokinesis)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Touch Required +1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Normally psionics work at range<br/>\n<br/>\n    Sympathetic Requirement: +1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Character must have an article that belongs to the target<br/>\n<br/>\n    Emotional Requirement: +1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Character must be feeling a certain emotion to activate this power (must be angry to use Fire Bolt, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Spiritual Requirement: +1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Psionic power is tied to the character's religious beliefs and character must be adhering to the precepts of their religion in order to access their power.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Uncontrolled (- to rolls): +1L<br/>\n<br/>\n    Wild Talent (User cannot control when power activates): +1L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Referee will control when power can be used (this does not confer the automatic advantage)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Character Weakness: +1L - Character weaknesses have to be extreme reactions to everyday occurrences. <br/>\n<br/>\n        Character is allergic to ultraviolet radiation or takes damage from silver or..?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What is -1L and +1L?<br/>\n<br/>\nA: Well, you can use advantages and disadvantages to tweak the system. For instance, if you wanted a broad power, but you wanted to make it harder to defend against, take a disadvantage and voila! You have a broad power that is harder to defend against (e.g., +1L - where L=Level of power). Or if you want to take a narrow scope power and make it even more powerful, take an advantage. This will make your narrow scope power easier to defend against, but the advantage you buy should more than compensate for it. Also, I just wanted to point out that contrary to most systems, there is not a psionics point and cost system. Although these systems are intended to bring balance, they do not fit most fiction that includes psionics (we have heard of more than one mage too tired to keep casting, but never a psychic - in fact most drama around psychic powers involve turning it off).<br/>\n<br/>\n To summarize, basically, players have to split the emphasis on applicability to different situations and impact on the game world. I think you can do the same thing with WPR. Let the player come up with the effect, and let the GM determine its limitations. for instance, you could have a wiener player say, "I want the dragon to see my face and have a heart attack" and the GM can respond with, "OK, but he gets a save throw, he needs 3 or higher on one d20." Allow the two to negotiate it, allow, in the rules, a step where the immature player says, "Jeez, alright, what if he dies if I get a crit" and the GM can say, OK, but it has to be a crit within 5 turns of when the WPR is spent" and in that way, its not an all or nothing venture. But the player and GM are free to explore their creativity and come up with a solution that brings on the awesome, but is not outside the realm of what all the players (including the GM) want.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry for the long post, hope that helps.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120285/#Comment_120285" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T22:41:13+00:00" title="January 17, 2008 10:41PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: outsider</cite>eah, James I realize the contradiction in terms between my statement that it is a "Glorified D&amp;D" and the statement that it is "so far from D&amp;D now."

Thanks for checking it out - I actually want to take the concept further (Drives is the next step and I'm lucky enough to be in an online game that uses them) but I'm taking a sabbatical from d20oid design until 2009.  So Story Games has my undivided attention.<br/><br/>I'd recommend picking up some games that do things really differently - and play them.  Play Dogs in the Vineyard, Primetime Adventures, Universalis, and Polaris for 3 sessions each.
