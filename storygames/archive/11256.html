I'd actually heard of it before in a roundabout way: a board I frequent, <a href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/" rel="nofollow">Snail's Pace</a>, has a (currently stalled) game of it going on.  I didn't recognize it by title back then, and now here I was looking at this strange, little two-page thing with a terrific layout and a lot of tantalizing little story/character hooks attached.<br/><br/>Basically I was at a loss as to how someone would <i>play</i> it.  Take a look at it and you will see that <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow">GHOST/ECHO</a> gives you three lines of setup and a lot of questions to answer.  You use the tools, like the names of characters and places, to tell this story that is essentially spun out of whole cloth.  There was talk on the channel of my running it.  I said I'd consider it.  Later I passed it to M to see what she thought and to my surprise she consented to run it for me that night.  Okay, then.<br/><br/>We sat down with no prep, just two copies of the <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow">GHOST/ECHO</a> document between us and some six-sided dice.  I did as much scene-setting as a GM would normally do, proceeding from the plot seed the document provides: <i>While looting in the Ghost World, you crew was sold out.  You walk right into an ambush, with hungry wraiths on your heels.</i><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>I said we were at the Undercross, just Hull (my character) and Demon, a ghoster beneath a huge intersection of massive, rusting pneumatic tubes through which rushed passenger trains powered by \xe6theric energy.  Demon tapped into the node that fed the Undercross and extracted from it some ghost paper containing information we didn't know and were forbidden to find out.  But because someone had sold us out, the wraith-hounds were on us, bound spirit dogs with a vicious disposition.<br/><br/>We fled into the Canals, but one of the hounds got a chunk out of Demon before we could make it all the way out of there.  The tide was out but the place was still crawling with ghostly rat-things like \xe6theric <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutria" rel="nofollow">nutria</a>.  Worse stuff came in with the waters, but thankfully that wasn't happening just yet.<br/><br/>Hull had his flash, a little device that, when used properly, could temporarily dissipate an \xe6theric manifestation.  He tried using it on the rat-things but only managed to hold them at bay.  Demon tapped channeled the ghost field without time to properly prepare himself and managed to turn the pursuing hounds onto the rat-things, but not without sustaining a psychic whammy that knocked him out cold.<br/><br/>Hull dragged Demon into a deep doorway and set up the flash to guard the entrance.  He called out to Kilo and asked for a pickup.  Kilo was toasted on spook, but he flew out anyway.  He got there just when the waters were starting to get uncomfortably high.<br/><br/>It wasn't that far to the Watchtower and the guy who paid for this night's work, a man named Bear, but Kilo was so out of his mind that he lost control of the car and managed to plow it into the side of a building before Hull could take control.  The car could still fly after that, but only just.  Kilo was passed out cold.  Hull had a messed up flyer and two unconscious dudes to worry about.<br/><br/>The Watchtower was an converted water tower on the edge of the Ruins, an expanse of ghost-ridden cityscape where the living didn't go.  Bear was paranoid about anyone, even Hull and Demon, seeing what was written on the ghost paper they'd manage to steal.  Hull managed to talk Bear out of lowering the price he'd agreed to pay, but had a feeling that Bear was going to figure some way to screw him anyway.<br/><br/>With the ghost paper unloaded, there was Demon to consider.  He was Hull's most valuable asset, a ghoster who was reliable and cheap and willing to take on shady jobs.  Hull tried the ghoster route when he was younger, but it didn't work out.  Now he was a fixer and he needed Demon healthy.  The only person who could help was Nix.<br/><br/>Nix was an in-betweener, a powerful figure living with one foot in the living world and the other foot in the \xe6ther.  He kept his trailer at the Night Carnival, a place where the living and the dead mingled for business and pleasure.  His trailer was like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle_truck" rel="nofollow">jingle truck</a>, festooned with his hoodoo trappings.  He agreed to a fair price to repair Demon's aura and he dismissed those damned wraith-hounds into the bargain.<br/><br/>With Demon on the mend and Kilo better to drive, Hull was able to go home to his cramped, underlit apartment.  There was evidence someone had been there recently, and that someone was in Hull's bed.  Turns out it was just Vixen, his sister, crashed there because her usual flop was unavailable.  But that's the kind of night Hull was having: just one damned thing after another.<br/><br/>What would happen the next day?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>We decided to call it quits at that point, not because we weren't interested in what was happening with Hull, Demon and the rest but because we'd run out of improv juice.  Neither one of us was sure where to go after the initial setup had been paid off.  We want to continue, which is a definite plus, but there are drawbacks to the whole make-it-up-as-you-go-along thing.<br/><br/>I also noticed that we tended to roleplay more on a story level than on a personal one.  In a more normative setting we'd speak in character voices and get into the details of interaction, but seemed more in keeping with the way the game proceeded for us to describe in more general terms what was said and done, as if we were summarizing action rather than taking it.  On the one hand it allowed for a stronger sense of authorship on my part than traditional gaming would do, but on the other hand it seemed more depersonalized.<br/><br/>Whatever else, <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow">GHOST/ECHO</a> gave us a new game to play.  We're both interested in expanding on the world, but I suspect our subsequent forays into that world will be typified by greater prep time and a little more traditional approach to the material.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250117/#Comment_250117" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-08T15:44:39+00:00" title="January  8, 2010  3:44PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This makes me very happy, Sam.

There was something about the way it's presented as a toolkit and not as a fully formed setting/ruleset (like a traditional game would be) that said, to me at least, that it should be taken as is.  I realize now that it could have been prepped normally, but I guess we were both taken with the improv idea and at least tried to make it work.  I think it did, despite a few fits and starts as we tried to keep up with the narrative we were making.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
