                    So I'm starting a separate thread, branching off from Vaxalon's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=365&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>"Design What Doesn't Matter"</b></a>.  This started with Joshua BishopRoby's blog post <a href="http://kallistipress.com/blog/?p=101" rel="nofollow"><b>"RPGs, Pulleys, and Microwave Ovens"</b></a>.  <br/><br/>I'd like to talk more concretely about this, because I think there's a difference in perception over how game designs work.  So I'd like to suggest a specific discussion of Steve Kenson's <i>Blue Rose</i>, as a game cited by both Brand Robins and Joshua BishopRoby.  I'm not a huge fan of Blue Rose, but I liked it enough upon reading it to eventually try out a one-shot game.  I wrote an <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11365.phtml" rel="nofollow"><b>RPGnet Review</b></a> of it before my test run.  After my test run, I was less impressed with the combat system and balance.  For a reference on the system, I have a rough SRD of the <b>Blue Rose</b> core rules for this system online, though password-protected. (Go to <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/srd/srd_true_romantic/" rel="nofollow"><tt>http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/srd/srd_true_romantic/</tt></a> using username "guest" and password "guest".)<br/><br/>Incidentally, Joshua BR started an earlier thread regarding <i>Blue Rose</i>, namely <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=151" rel="nofollow"><b>"Setting/System Disconnects, and How To Fix Them"</b></a>.  <br/><br/><b>Brand_Robins</b> wrote:
<blockquote>Heroquest will push your play, it will force things to move around its resolution system. Ditto the Pool. OTOH, Blue Rose (for example) will not have a similar effect upon play. Blue Rose has romantic fantasy at its heart, but very few rules that push for romantic fantasy in structure or color. Blue Rose doesn't structure play the way Heroquest, the Pool, and PTA do. It just sits there waiting for you to use it to run combat, determine sorcery power levels, and maybe do a Diplomacy roll or three -- while you structure the narrative, figure out the player's conflicts without flags, and use your players not-in-the-book system to make it work or not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I have mixed feelings about Blue Rose. Blue Rose I think is actually a well designed DWDM game, I just happen to not like it as much because these days I want games that DWM, or at least design to give game structure. <br/><br/>However, I have lots of friends that LOVE Blue Rose and LOVE GURPS, and so I'm trying to talk from their experiences and the things they've told me about why they like those systems. I have a hard time with games that are both not focused and not designed to what matters (so GURPS is in my "right out" list) -- and so my pull for the one side is pulling for a team I'm not on, I guess. </blockquote>
I would like to analyze more what is going on here.  As I understand it, you believe your friends that they have reasons to like Blue Rose, but you don't have a good understanding of why.  Now, two points about understanding: <br/><br/>1) Just because they love it doesn't mean that the mechanics must have some intrinsic good quality.  They might not be critical in their thinking regarding it.  However, it's also possible that you're not seeing past your own blinders here.  <br/><br/>2) Loving a design is relative.  Just because they love it doesn't mean that everything about it is perfect.  It just might be better for what they want then the competition that they're familiar with.  So, for example, it might be much better than both D&amp;D3 and Primetime Adventures for what they want.  That doesn't mean that there aren't gaping flaws in it, just that it's better than the alternatives for what they want.  <br/><br/>I'd like to examine your suggestion that Blue Rose won't push your play.  I suspect that there are two things happening here.  First, the group is selectively ignoring many of the rules in play.  This isn't peculiar to games like Blue Rose -- I've seen the same thing happen using D&amp;D, GURPS, and even Primetime Adventures.  It depends on the mindset of the players, and to some degree on the quality of the rules (sucky rules tend to be ignored more).  Second, I think you regard designs like GURPS or Blue Rose as the "default", because it's what the group did when you first encountered them.  Because it was the previous norm, you imagine that it doesn't push play.  However, I suspect that if they had instead gotten started on significantly different games (like Tunnels and Trolls, or Toon, or Amber), and then they switched to Blue Rose, that you would either see it push them or see them ignore the rules.  <br/><br/>So let's dig into what influence the Blue Rose rules have on the narrative.  Blue Rose doesn't have a "Core Story" -- to use Mike Mearls term.  There is no simple blueprint for play like making a dungeon in D&amp;D, or a Master in MLWM, or a Town in DitV.  Thus, it's true that the group has to invent the larger situation more on their own.  On the other hand, the same can be said of HeroQuest and The Pool.  <br/><br/>As for flagging, Blue Rose has two types.  First, players define strengths for their characters via their abilities, skills, and feats.  They want to use these to their advantage.  Second, players define a Calling, Light Nature, and Shadow Nature.  These in principle define what they will be striving for, and mechanically how they recover Conviction Points.  (For those not familiar, these are based on tarot cards.  You pick a Calling (represented by a Major Arcana card) and a Light Nature and a Shadow Nature (each represented by a Minor Arcana card).  When you act to pursue your Calling in accordance with either of your Light or Shadow natures, you gain one Conviction Point.  I don't think this works very well as a reward system because it's too vague and it is disconnected from the other mechanics of play.  But it seems reasonable for flagging.  (I had pregenerated characters for my one-shot, so I didn't use this aspect much.)  <br/><br/>As for its support of the genre, I tend to agree that it misses key points.  I'll compare some notes:  To me, the key was that there is no encouragement to make the PCs social outcasts at the start, and no mechanism for them to earn acceptance.  There are Reputation rules, but they are just linear with level.  Level progression I think is for the most part fine.  Extended series will generally have an escalation of challenge.  However, social acceptance shouldn't be tied to it.  I would say there should be a Social Status trait like Wealth which can vary over time.  <br/><br/>The resolution system also has an influence on the emphasis of challenges.  Blue Rose has an involved system for combat.  That doesn't mean that combat will be common, but if it occurs it will tend to take a while and involve a large degree of focus.  By contrast, the system has a very quick mechanic for social influence challenges, which are always a single roll.  Other challenges tend to be somewhere in between for involvement.  This pushes what is emphasized in play.  <br/><br/>In my experience of Romantic Fantasy, the quick influence roll works reasonably -- influence and social conflict don't seem emphasized -- but the True20 combats seem overlong to me.  Also, it doesn't do well with static and/or environmental challenges, which are common in the literature but are generally hard to make interesting in games (in my experience).  <br/><br/>Anyhow, for those who believe the idea of "Design What Doesn't Matter" as good design -- what here is good?  How would you improve this design using the "Design What Doesn't Matter" philosophy?  Personally, I would try to de-emphasize combat some, and emphasize at least some static challenges (perhaps by some sort of wagering and reward system).                </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>To clarify something that everyone has misread me about. I never said that DWDM is good design in that it would be something I would want from my games, or games I buy. <br/><br/>I said that it is a design choice that people make on purpouse, knowing what it is that they do. <br/><br/>I said that, with that in mind, it is important to understand why they would make that choice and what the results of that choice in individual games and in the consumer habits of the market would be. <br/><br/>I have said that it is important to understand why people would go for games that do DWDM over games that DWM, because I think a lot of blindness and gaps in our philsophy will be found there. (As well as in theirs, as well as in places where we overlap without knowing it.) <br/><br/>(Many of these things are issues you deal with above, so even if you thought I was saying something other than I was, you still managed to get at what I was wanting to get at.) <br/><br/>Now, in so far as Blue Rose is good design, my agrument for that it is because it does what it wants to do in a way it wants to do it in. That is to say: it makes a standard version of a popular RPG into a less crunchy system in order to remove the gamist step-on-up elements to more fully concentrate on the Sim high-concept issues that form the "monolith" of many of the folks who want to play the game. It does not give high-intensity rules for the romantic fantasy element because members of its target market are not looking for those, they already know how to get them and mostly want the system to "get out of the way." <br/><br/>The fact that many folks are happy with it is, as you said, probably due to the fact that other systems do put preasure on them in specific ways (though often vauge ways that the designers and players may not be fully aware of) and Blue Rose is made to shift that preasure into a direction they are more comfortable with. It does so in a very soft way, however, and as you note lacks elements of "what matters" by still having a lot of combat focus and no wagering or reward system based around the elements that should be core to play. <br/><br/>So Blue Rose is successful not because I think it is brilliant or even because it is a game I would want to design myself. It is a successful DWDM game because it saw a target market, figured out what that market wanted, and delivered it to them in a high-concept, low-impact, easy to integrate into your already existing playstyles way. They succesfully sussed out what it was about D&amp;D that gave the right and wrong preasures to this group of players, and pulled large parts of the wrong preasure out while leaving the right preasures in (though not doing a lot to extend on the right preasures). As a result the True 20 System, and Blue Rose, were financial successes that gave people the things they wanted from a game -- which is to get out of the way. <br/><br/>Is this what I would want in a game or want from my own game design? Nope. But did it give enough people a game that made them happy and cheery and full of fan-joy? Yep. And I don't buy the arguement that the only reason for that is because they're hypnotized meat-tubes soaked in consumerist culture*. I think it is because it actually gave them something they wanted.<br/><br/>*Mostly because if that was the case it would get us all. We are all diseased.                        </div>

                            First, I nitpick your terms.  It's traditional.  Blue Rose is a book, a product.  It presents a text that bears a design of rules intended for play.  When real people sit down at a table and use those rules, they create a game.  It's counter-intuitive to say that Blue Rose isn't a game, but we need to be really precise with what exactly we're talking about when we say "Blue Rose does this."<br/><br/>Blue Rose gives you rules for: detailed combat, detailed magic, moderately detailed social conflict, moderately detailed commerce (buying things, building wealth), and a, yes, abyssmal reputation tracking system.  It has relatively sketchy monsters, a sample adventure/situation, an elaborate (and mostly irrelevant) history, and a geography in broad strokes.  Its character creation system allows you to spend points to buy attributes and skills, and select feats.  (Am I missing any rules?)<br/><br/>Blue Rose tells you how each of these systems works.  Blue Rose does not tell you how to put them together.<br/><br/>In my solo game with my wife, we set to work using some of the provided bits to create something that we cared about.  We used the bits of the provided geography that suited us (Aldins, Kernites, and Islanders) and added in what mattered to us -- a network of towns that actually had relations between each other that could be strained, strains on the meritocratic system of government, a rough economy, a ruined city and history.  Of note are those strains on government and the ruined city -- both used the provided material as a starting-off point and was then elaborated to our purposes (creating conflict in government and an ancient romance, specifically).<br/><br/>In actual play, we used perhaps half of the combat rules, most of the magic rules, used the social conflict rules for more than that subsystem was probably designed to bear, and didn't even touch wealth and reputation.  The game featured a young girl protecting her home region of Aldis from threats too great for normals but too overlookable for the big guns in the Knights of the Blue Rose, and got her into a secret society, a couple romances, and lasting friendships.<br/><br/>The Stuff That Mattered are those last three -- the secret society, the romance, and the friendships, and maybe a little bit of the protecting of the weak.  With the exception of the last, we didn't use any rules support for any of these things.  It was all "just roleplay" and relied heavily on our real-world relationship and history of gaming together.  Of special note was the situation, which I created knowing what my wife likes to play and without any system support from the book.<br/><br/>I did, however, use a couple monsters from the book because I couldn't give a flying fuck how many hit points a zombie has.  Combat was pretty simplistic, which was fine and good cause it was mostly window dressing.  The setting was a nice backdrop, but we could have played the same situation and almost the same exact game in any generic fantasy setting.  None of this stuff Mattered, even though we used it, even though we spent time in the game manipulating it, because it was all support for the secrets+romance+friendship thing we really cared about.<br/><br/>Any clearer, John?                        </div>

                            Wow, somebody else talking about marketing.  That's kind of creepy.<br/><br/>Just to underscore what Brand said -- the DWM/DWDM divide is a <em>design philosophy</em> and is, ideally, chosen as a marketing decision.  It looks at what's out there and creates a product to fit the needs that are observed.<br/><br/>Any questions as to 'quality' are, as all questions of quality, totally subjective and relatively subservient to the question of addressing the needs of the market.<br/><br/>Oh, hey, appropriate metaphor time -- it's like VHS and Betamax.  Two ways to make your product work.  Is one better than the other?  Is one cheaper than the other?  Is one more popular than the other?  Is one more profitable than the other?  There are a lot of questions, and 'good' applies to a lot of them, sometimes on one side and sometimes on another.                        </div>

                            Another issue with Blue Rose, as a sort of addendum to what Josh said above. <br/><br/>The reward system of Blue Rose is a very interesting case in "what matters." I talked with a friend recently about Blue Rose, and one of the things he liked most was the way the reward system worked. He hated the way D&amp;D did it, and couldn't get his head around Keys from TSOY (which I'd been trying to shove down his throat for weeks). He liked Blue Rose's system because "it does it the way it already works in most of the games I play in, its just more direct about it." <br/><br/>In D&amp;D you gain a level when you get enough XP. You gain XP by overcoming challanges, with the amount set by how challanging the encounter is. Thus you want to face tough challanges, step on up, and get your reward. <br/><br/>In TSOY you set your own goals and issues. You gain XP by bringing them into play, confronting them, commenting on them through play, and so on. Thus you want to drive the game towards your own issues as often as possible, get story now, and get your reward. <br/><br/>Both of these games tell you, through their reward system, what matters and what drives the structure of the game. <br/><br/>In Blue Rose, you know how you level up? The GM decides it based on what he feels. The exact text is, "Essentially, after an adventure or two, whenever you feel the heroes have reached a point of development in their story, you can award them an additional level" (BR, 174). <br/><br/>This does, I suppose, tell us what matters in Blue Rose in one sense -- convincing the GM you've come to a point of development in your story. However, even that is undercut by the rest of the paragraph, "Generally, heroes should earn one level every one or two adventures, meaning they will go from 1st level to 20th level in twenty to fourty adventures total." So what matters in Blue Rose, really, is playing. Just playing. Not driving anywhere, not stepping on up, not story now. In a real way it isn't even about following the GM's preplaned arc -- though you need to be warry if you don't do that as it could slightly slow down your progression.  <br/><br/>Now, in terms of what Ron has said about reward cycles and how they influence play, this is a pretty big bug-a-boo. What matters in the game besides just playing to play to play to be playing? Blue Rose doesn't tell you. Like, at all. <br/><br/>And yet people like it, because it fits with what they already do. By this I suspect they mean that either they do see the reward of playing being playing to play to be playing, or that they have their own system for determining who levels up and gets advanced, and they find the Blue Rose system loose enough that it doesn't get in the way of what they're doing. They like it because it doesn't give negative preasure against their established mode of play. <br/><br/>In a very real way it seems that BR's reward system was designed not to matter, and because of that it lets folks plug in their own reward systems (or lack there of) in a way that lets them do what they'd do anyway.                        </div>

                            I love the Blue Rose levelling "mechanic".  To me, its subtext totally reads, "Look, we all know that you're twisting and ignoring these rules about XP, anyway.  When something cool happens in a climactic scene, the players get a level.  You know, like you make it happen already."                        </div>

Well, on the one hand, this sounds similar to what I recommended:  that is, there are no rules or even guidelines for Situation creation; combat is a little too heavy; and the Reputation rules are a waste of space.  <br/><br/>But here's the question: were there things that you would have preferred to do differently?  i.e. How would you design it better?  <br/><br/>Would you prefer to have had mechanics for the relationships?  i.e. Have a numeric Attraction rating (or perhaps something more complex like a damage track of its own) that you kept track of for the romantic relationships, perhaps?                        </div>

I don't see how that follows.  Just because a line is a vague success doesn't mean that there aren't things that could be done better.  Green Ronin wants to make a profit, obviously, but all other things being equal, better design will sell better  (in my opinion).  Given more development time, playtest, and feedback, I think the game would have turned out differently -- though not necessarily in the direction you would take it.  Regardless, though, if we're going to talk about game design at all here, we have to be willing to form judgements about design.  So, yes, I'd like to hear about what you thought of the written rules -- and specifically my question about relationship mechanics.                        </div>

So I suggested the toolkit approach in an earlier post.  However, surely the design still matters for this, right?  That is, some designs will be easier to pick and choose from, as well as having superior quality tools within the kit.  Or are you simply saying that system doesn't matter?                        </div>

                            System does matter. <br/><br/>It's just a matter of which part of the system matters. <br/><br/>A lot of gamers don't want a lot of positive preasure from their games -- they don't want the game to tell them how to play. They also don't want a lot of negative preasure from their games -- they don't want the game to be full of fiddly bits that they have to work to remove from the game. <br/><br/>The first reason is why a lot of established players have problems with games like HeroQuest or Dogs. Both games preasure (forward) how you play and structure play and use your reward cycle and all of the rest. The second is the reason why a lot of established players bitched about D&amp;D. It had a lot of gamist elements that weren't doing well for their high-concept Sim games. <br/><br/>Blue Rose, otoh, gave them what they were looking for because it didn't really do either of the above. Or, that is to say, it did so in a way that fit with the methods and principled decisions they already used to run game. Rather then putting preasure on their mode of play, it lay down and asked them to walk upon it. <br/><br/>When you go to play Dogs, you don't get optional rules. All the rules of Dogs are pretty set in stone, and the thing that folks get told off for when things go wrong most is not following the rules. You had that problem? Did you use the town creation rules? You had this problem? Did you set stakes before you started rolling? You had the other problem? Did you make small, givable stakes?  That's because in Dogs the system matters like this: <br/><br/><img alt="Ideal Dog's Play" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/sysdogs.gif"/><br/><br/>When you go to play Blue Rose, you get lots of optional rules around a core system that is much like the other core system that you've (probably) already been playing. When things go wrong you look to your own group and your play skills, because you know that's where the issue is. Did you have that problem? Well your GM isn't listening to you. You had this problem? Well the players need to be more mature. That's because in Blue Rose the system matters like this: <br/><br/><img alt="Ideal Blue Rose Play" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/sysgurpsrules.gif"/><br/><br/>Now, with that in mind, better quality tools in the toolkit are always a good thing. The question you have to ask, however, when you start making this tool is: Will this put preasure on people to play in a way other than the way they are already playing, or will it better support the things they are already doing? If the answer is yes, then it won't work for DWDM, because it violates the mandate of "make systems that support what people are already doing/going to do anyway." <br/><br/>So better reptutation mechanics in Blue Rose would probably be a good thing. As they are they're pretty useless. And having some better ones in there would probably not preasure play too much one way or the other -- especially if they're fully modular and can be used or ignored freely. OTOH, a wagering and reward system for social engagement RP would probably not work, because it would put significant preasure on the way people already deal with social RP. If it was fully optional it could work, I suppose, but even then I can see it being a bug-a-boo because an unhappy player (even if they are only unhappy at the moment because they lost, not unhappy because of ongoing dysfunction) could start putting preasure on the group to use a system that will force them to change the way that they play. <br/><br/>You can, and probably should, build better tools even in a DWDM game. However you have to do so without making those tools neccesary, and without letting them force change onto the way people already play/want to play. If you support things they want to do anyway but need tools for, that's good. If you give them tools that make them change (like, say, Universalis or My Life With Master) that's not -- because then you've started deciding what matters rather than letting them do it.<br/><br/>Note: "Good" in the above means "good by the logic of this type of design." It DOES NOT MEAN "what Brand thinks is good."                        </div>

                            System Doesn't Matter is MY soapbox, not JoshuaBR's. :) <br/>
I'm not sure if Joshua's definitions and mine are eye-to-eye, but he hasn't objected so far. Let me give it another shot (I note that Brand has stated some very similar points in his post): <br/>
<br/>
DWM = designing for the game. It's MY game, and if anyone else is going to play it, THIS is how. You don't have a choice. If you don't play it this way, you're not playing my game. <br/>
The designer may be magnanimous/indifferent as to where customers take his game in reality, but from a design perspective, DWM is pretty focused. <br/>
<br/>
DWDM = designing for the customer/player. It's YOUR game. I will help you play the game you want to play, but I don't tell you how to do it. I'll give you the bits you need to support the style of game you want to play. It could be generic rules, or a toolkit, or supplemental information, or a "shell" covering material you (the player) simply don't want to deal with. <br/>
This may look like a toolkit option nearly all the time, but it simply an enabling mechanism to help customers reach the point where they're getting something out of the game. <br/>
<br/>
DDWM = not designing the game. Uh, you'll need this to play if you want to play my way, but I'm lazy/disinterested/distracted and I won't do it for you. So, here's the idea -- run off and play however you like. <br/>
This is pretty close to DWDM, except that the designer posts no rules at all, but rather just a general idea of the necessity for rules. <br/>
<br/>
I believe many posters are equating System Does Matter with Design What Matters, which is not correct. <br/>
I am a proponent of Design What Matters. <br/>
I have never been a whole-hearted proponent of System Does Matter.                        </div>

                            The thing is, virtually any game can be used as a toolkit.  <br/><br/>For example, I played in a game at AmberCon NorthWest called "Amber's Watchdogs" -- which nominally used Dogs in the Vineyard but strongly drifted its written rules, and the result was a very different game.  (cf. my <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/cons/acnw2005.html#amberswatchdogs" rel="nofollow"> <b>ACNW Convention Report</b> </a>)  I don't think this is isolated: I've read about all sorts of Dogs variants, adapting the rules to fit.  For example, in a recent thread about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=312&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>"Directorial Stance in Dogs"</b></a>, Daniel (coffeestain) posted that he's been playing that a Raise can be events unrelated to the character.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I've also talked to a number of True20 enthusiasts, who play True20 exactly as written.  (I played it fairly close to the rules the two times I tried, though not completely.)  <br/><br/>Is there an essential difference between Michael Sullivan's "Amber's Watchdogs" and Joshua's drifted game of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blue Rose</span>?  Is the argument that modded Dogs is rare whereas modded Blue Rose is common?  That seems like something that depends on a lot of factors outside of the rules themselves, and hard to nail down the rate of.                        </div>

                            Yes, you can drift any game.  Some games are built with drift in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, it's not what you do with the game that defines it as DDWM or DWM, but what the design philosophy is.<br/>
<br/>
Dogs has a paragraph at the end, that says, "Yeah, you can play Dogs with different settings.  You'll need to fix the "what's wrong" part of the town creation, and ceremony" and gives you NO help in actually doing so.  That's not DDWM design.  If it were DDWM there'd be whole lists of possible "what's wrong" hierarchies.                        </div>

                            Sure.  And I can see, say, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fudge</span> as a game which clearly is designed around the idea of assembling a bunch of optional rules to run your game with.  <br/><br/>However, Blue Rose isn't like that.  It doesn't have a lot of optional rules, and has a crunchy system which many people are enthusiastic about.  (I'm basing this on the True20 boards, say.)

                            The jumping-up-and-down part of "System Does Matter" is that System is not the Book.

                            Regarding a glossary -- I'd suggest instead Doyce's wiki page.  The wiki has input from people other than Ron Edwards as well as links to the original and related discussions, and can be updated.  Read it, and add in your own notes!<br/><br/><a href="http://random.average-bear.com/TheoryTopics/HomePage" rel="nofollow">http://random.average-bear.com/TheoryTopics/HomePage</a><br/><br/>As for the Blue Rose Advancement system...<br/><br/><b>Brand_Robins</b> wrote:
<blockquote>Now, in terms of what Ron has said about reward cycles and how they influence play, this is a pretty big bug-a-boo. What matters in the game besides just playing to play to play to be playing? Blue Rose doesn't tell you. Like, at all.</blockquote>
What matters in the game is what the players care about when playing it.  The game book author can put in a statement about what <i>he</i> thinks matters, but that isn't necessarily going to be what matters to the actual people playing the game.  A statement of what matters seems to me like a preface from the author of a novel telling you what the meaning is.  
<blockquote>And yet people like it, because it fits with what they already do. By this I suspect they mean that either they do see the reward of playing being playing to play to be playing, or that they have their own system for determining who levels up and gets advanced, and they find the Blue Rose system loose enough that it doesn't get in the way of what they're doing. They like it because it doesn't give negative preasure against their established mode of play.<br/><br/>In a very real way it seems that BR's reward system was designed not to matter, and because of that it lets folks plug in their own reward systems (or lack there of) in a way that lets them do what they'd do anyway.</blockquote>
The advancement system for Blue Rose is very similar to stat improvement in Sorcerer -- where you get a set of improvement rolls at the end of each storyline (which isn't the same as the end of each session).  Technically, this motivates the players to make their stories as short as possible -- but in practice that isn't a strong motivator.  In other words, advancement isn't a motivating reward.  Rather, it's just a defined progression.  <br/><br/>As for people doing that anyhow, to me that shows the opposite.  That is, what people will tend to do in practice is support <i>what matters to them</i>.  If a lot of people tend to change a rule in the book, that probably means that it's a problem for them.  Maybe the next edition of the game will fix that point.  Rules like this, which are based on user feedback, aren't likely to be new/innovative or change how people play -- but they are functional and speak to what matters to those players.  <br/><br/>So the fact that the Blue Rose system matches the advancement system which many people house-rule to me shows that it <i>better</i> represents what matters to them than a more complicated system (like, say, Storyteller) which players tend to ignore.                        </div>

The Dogs system is a negative feedback system.  It rewards taking fallout -- especially d4 fallout since those maximize your chance of 1s which give the most dice.  Note that there is no explicit theme here.  Dogs does not give you points for making moral judgements because that's "what matters".  Nor does the fact that Dogs rewards d4 fallout mean that the game is "about" having setbacks in arguments.  <br/><br/>The fallout rewards help the game flow by encouraging more back-and-forth in conflicts rather than just always pushing highest dice (i.e. block, block, block, block, blow, win); and moreover they encourage using the conflict system in general.  <br/><br/>Narratively, they reward Taking the Blow -- which means setbacks in conflict.  This does set a tone for the game which works well for the theme -- i.e. Dogs are grizzled and scarred.  I'd contrast this to, say, the <i>James Bond 007</i> reward system where Hero Points are gained from rolling critical successes.  That system rewards rolling on your highest skills -- i.e. showing off.  Both the JB007 and DitV reward systems support the themes of the games, but don't define them.<br/><br/>In practice, Dogs players don't make their choices over what will get them the most fallout rewards.  However, there may be times when a player is encouraged to get into an argument to power up by Taking The Blow -- just as sometimes in D&amp;D the players are encouraged to attack something for the XP.  <br/><br/>The Blue Rose advancement system is a deliberate and strong choice.  Compared to a game like Dogs (which rewards fallout) or D&amp;D (which rewards fights), it removes that chase after XP.  Instead, you're only rewarding for pursuing your Calling, and by taking actions that you think will result in success.                        </div>

                            John, that's a great analysis. One thing I don't quite get, though, is the fact that even Experience fallout can be "bad" if the player wants--e.g., to lower the die size or subtract dice from a powerful Trait or Relationship. I used that the other day but interpreting it as a Reward entails a conception of mechanical rewards which is pretty skewed from traditional thinking. I.e., if I look at that as a Reward, then I must be getting a kick out of authoring adversity for my character. Or generally, I'm being Rewarded by being given an opportunity to <i>change</i> my character in a way that connects narratively either to the immediate conflict or to where I'm steering him.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how well that works in practice, though. In fact I think I'm going to be doing some unabashed XP chasing next session.<br/><br/>But anyway, shouldn't we be looking at the GMing guidelines and town creation rules as well, in terms looking at how the design addresses what matters? And is there anything similar in Blue Rose?                        </div>

Well, I was answering Brand's question, which was specifically about fallout / experience in Dogs.  As for Blue Rose, the short answer is no.  There is nothing like town creation, and the GM advice section is vague (and mostly sucky, in my opinion).  <br/><br/>One thing is to avoid making assumptions about what a given subsystem is.  i.e. Getting points or levels isn't always a "reward" system designed to motivate you to maximize your rate of reward.  I think that's one thing that may throw people about Blue Rose -- it tosses out that traditional thinking that experience points / levels are something that the players should chase after and earn by particular actions.                        </div>

                            If I can inject my own observation-analogy here for a mo':<br/><br/>Design What Matters is a sandcastle.<br/>Design What Doesn't Matter is a sandbox.<br/>Don't Design What Matters is a sandbox filled with gravel.<br/><br/>Design What Matters (Focus): "You want a sandcastle?  Here's a sandcastle.  Now, if you knock this bit off here and maybe build up the other side and then fill up this bit over here with water - you can make yourself a pirate hideout.  Just be aware that you've got some work to do."  <br/><br/>The design has a 'fixed form', but that fixed form is, in fact more plastic that it might at first seem, so long as you don't muck about too much or demand the impossible, like a 20' spire of sand.<br/><br/>Design What Doesn't Matter (Multi-Focus): "You want a sandcastle?  Well, here's a box full of sand, a shovel, a trowel, a rake, a pail, the hose is over there - there's some twigs and stuff laying around.  Oh, and we've got these dandy molds that you can put wet sand in and make the walls with.  If you want a pirate cove, well, I already showed you want we've got here."<br/><br/>The design has a looser form, with lots of opportunity to craft the kind of sandcastle or sandcastlesque object that you want.  You're probably not going to get the professional crafted thing that you see in the brochures, but you'll probably dig it because you've done this kind of thing before.  You've been building sandcastles for a while already, and you know what you like, after all.<br/><br/>Don't Design What Matters (Unfocused): "Sandcastle, huh?  *sigh*  Well, I think there's a shovel in the garage, if you want to go get it.  You'll probably need some kinda mortar to hold it together ... I suppose you can dig up some of the yard and wattle-and-daub it."<br/><br/>The further extreme of DWDM, really.  You can get the thing that you want, but you're going to have to carry most of the water for the system, so to speak.  And even then, you might not wind up with the kind of thing that you want.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>What I see as the main disconnect here is that the DWM (focused) folks look at a DWDM (mutli-focus) game, and through that lens see those facets outside of what <i>they</i> want from the game as DDWM (unfocused) design.<br/><br/>Similarly, you can make the argument that someone born-n-raised on D&amp;D, an <i>unfocused</i> (one can even call it <i>The</i> unfocused design, from when all other unfocused designs are sprung) design, would look at the elements of a multi-focus game and render it as <i>focused</i>.  In other words, the D&amp;D-only player gets involved in a Blue Rose game and sees unicorns and Light and Dark Natures and think that this is about as far into focused gaming as they want to go.<br/><br/>So Brand looks at Blue Rose, coming from being steeped in <i>PTA</i> and other high-focus designs and notices all the bits that are outside the supposed romantic-fantasy focus of the game and sees a lot of wasted design, and the need for extra design.<br/><br/>Josh does the same thing - goes into a game that focuses on what he expects from <i>a</i> Blue Rose (which is not necessarily <i>the</i> Blue Rose) and finds the same thing.<br/><br/>However, if you take this to the <i>ad absurdum</i>, what you wind up with is another unfocused game.  Josh said:
<blockquote>The Stuff That Mattered are those last three -- the secret society, the romance, and the friendships, and maybe a little bit of the protecting of the weak. With the exception of the last, we didn't use any rules support for any of these things.</blockquote>
Ok, so you start with Blue Rose and you add some secret society rules and beef up the relationship rules.  I think everyone can agree that the combat was overlong in Blue Rose as well, so take that down a notch.  Keep doing this for every set of expectations, and you've got another game like D&amp;D, only with a non-combat cluster of foci.  Now show that to the next person down the line, and you'll get a different set of priorities.  Design to those priorities while keeping all the stuff we've already done ... and so on and so on.<br/><br/>So DWDM is really a middle ground - the meeting plane between the focused and the unfocused games.  Compromises are made for the sake of commerical interest towards the unfocued crowd because, let's face it, there are more of them than there are of the focused crowd.<br/><br/>The other route, short of metasystem, is the focused game taken through multiple colored lenses.  Yes, <i>DitV</i> works for <i>Firefly</i>.  Or paladins, or Crusaders - any situation where there's morality, authority and a confused muddle in which these two things are trying to operate.<br/><br/>This is the middle ground, folks.  This is where the Forge hits the street, so to speak.  Blue Rose leans further down towards its roots, d20.  But as much as I'd suggest more design towards <i>Dogs</i> from d20, I suggest design from <i>Dogs</i> in the opposite direction - optional color, optional design, middleware structures - towards d20.                        </div>

                            One thing that really rocked my world when I read D&amp;D 3.0 is when there was a sidebar in the DMG, I think, about creating your own classes.  And in the sidebar they cook up a Witch class right before yer eyes.  I loved that they acknowledged that people house rule the shit out of their home D&amp;D games and gave you some things to think about when and if yuo decided to do so.  It was like they said, "Hey, we know you drift, here are some cool tires so you don't hit the wall."<br/>

                            Just for reference, when I speak of DWM and DWDM, I'm talking about them as design philosophies, not as characteristics of the designs themselves.<br/><br/>When I'm a <em>park landscape designer</em>, I decide whether I want to give the kiddies a well-stocked sandbox to play in (DWDM) or one of those elaborate jungle gyms shaped as a castle (DWM).  Neither the sandbox nor the jungle gym are DWM or DWDM; <em>my decisions</em> when designing are DWM or DWDM.  Saying that "the castle is DWM" is, really, shorthand for "the castle was designed with a DWM mindset."                        </div>

                            Kuma, I'm completely baffled by your analogy.  <br/><br/>You think that D&amp;D is a sandbox which supports you in building anything you want, and PTA is a premade sandcastle?!?  I don't get it.  To me, D&amp;D is much more specific and focused than PTA.  There is a very limited range of starting PCs, and very concrete guidelines for adventures (i.e. making a map and stocking it with monsters and treasure).  There are a lot more premade components (monsters, treasure, spells, abilities).  <br/><br/>Joshua BR -- didn't you say that you now feel that PTA and The Pool are Design-What-Doesn't-Matter?  What do you think about PTA vs D&amp;D?                        </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>Interesting analysis of Dogs. The thing I think I'd disagree about, that I've seen happen very strongly every time I played Dogs, is that the point of the fallout isn't to "gain experience" it is to force a character to change and to force those changes to connect to the fiction. You take fallout from being involved, and the kind of fallout you put on your sheet gives a strong statement about the fiction and your character and your take on both. In Dogs your reward cycle comes from being effected by the fiction and having your character changed by the game. Dogs characters who won't change become useless pretty quickly. <br/><br/>Contrastingly in Blue Rose you aren't encouraged specifically to be effected by the game. You want to follow your Convinction hard, so there is little to no reason to move away from "doing what my guy does," and none given by the experience system -- because you will go up in levels every two adventures anyway. Blue Rose thus supports (or at least doesn't interfere with) strong characters who respond only or primarily to the controlling players wishes. <br/><br/>However, I still think that you are right that Blue Rose made a very strong design choice in its setup. It made a choice to support doing things the way people already do them. Dogs, otoh, also made a strong choice. It made a choice to support doing things the way the designer wants you to do them. <br/><br/>When you said: "Rules like this, which are based on user feedback, aren't likely to be new/innovative or change how people play"<br/><br/>I said yes. That is what Blue Rose does, and does well. Dogs, otoh, does the other (for many groups if not yours) -- it changes the way people play. <br/><br/>The "what matters" in a very real way IS NOT what matters to the players. It is what matters to the designer. If what matters to you happens to end up mattering to them in the exact same way, then their is no conflict. But most of the time it doesn't. <br/><br/>Which is why I said on Ludanta Retero several days ago: <br/><br/>"Ya know, at this point I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think it is about designing what matters or not.<br/><br/>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about if you deisgn to encorporate the monolith or to create a void. Do you make your game with the assumption that people already know how to play it and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be forced to change their structure, or do you make your game so that playing it by the rules forces a certain kind of play that may or may not be something the players have done before?<br/><br/>Does your game rely on the structure of Ã¢â‚¬Å“this is how RPGs are playedÃ¢â‚¬Â or does it tell your players how to play their game? "<br/><br/>So maybe I should be saying, "Design what you want your game to be in a way that forces people to play that way" vs "Design a game so that people can play it the same way they play all their other games."                        </div>

John, I suspect PTA and the Pool were both created with a pretty strong Design What Doesn't Matter impulse -- they are there as tools to help you do something that you would otherwise do, but those tools make doing that faster, simpler, and easier.<br/>
<br/>
Contrast with Dogs, where nobody was going to play guys whose role in the fiction is to judge the morals of other people, or Sorcerer, where nobody was going to play folks who begin the game bound to demons and engaged in Faustian bargains from the get-go.  These game designs push you to do things that you wouldn't have been doing on your own.                        </div>

                            Well, Kuma's post, and the speed with which people seem to have glommed onto it, makes me think that what I take from the discussion of DWM/DWDM is pretty different from what others do. My interest is more in whether the rules of the game (which I think corresponds to "principled decisions" in the picture Brand linked above) define what the game is "about", and not in whether the game is a "toolkit" or a special purpose tool.<br/><br/>If anyone's interested, the angle I come from starts with <a href="http://ewilen.livejournal.com/16535.html" rel="nofollow">a conversation I had with Thomas Robertson on my LJ</a>, and continues through the thread JoshBR's blog.                        </div>

                            I just think Kuma's post is wrong, actually -- in that DDWM isn't unfocused -- and that's not what I coined the term for, and DWM isn't "you wanna build a sandcastle, well here's something that isnt' a sandcastle, but could be" but "you wanna build a sandcastle?  Ok, well my idea of a sandcastle focuses on the way a sandcastle is doomed to die to the rising tide; always seeing the surf in the distance.  You wanna talk about a game of building things and collaberation, you might want to look at Fred's game, but my game isn't really about that, and probably can't be adapted into it...though you could probably made a snow fort game with a few changes."<br/>
<br/>
There isn't really a hard difference between DDWM and DWDM -- they're two different ways of look at some of the same games.  In one case, one is concentrating on the way the game tries to facilitate play without determining what matters (in fact, Don't Determine What Matters is the other official bacronym there); in the other case, one is focusing on the way the game uses design as a facilitator (design things that are useful and used, but don't Matter, and aren't a vehicle for design Force), rather than a prod to push a game's structure in a given direction.<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring the D&amp;D is/isn't focused design question, of course (IMO, it's an odd example of -accidentaly- focused design, which enforces its core beliefs because that's what the designers thought play was about rather than because they were conciously attempting to curb other behaviors.  D&amp;D3 is to a degree a concious re-imagining of these methods).                        </div>

                            Kuma's metaphor speaks to me of "toolkit games", and while I think that there's  a fairly strong tendency toward "not being 'about' anything" among "toolkit" (or "generic") games, the two things aren't the same. E.g., I've seen <i>Dogs</i> variants described that put the game in different settings, but I believe that variants done in the spirit of the text in the back, where there are guidelines for changing the setting, will generally have the same degree of "aboutness" and be "about" the same thing as the original. Same for <i>My Life with Master</i>, and, I suspect, <i>Sorcerer</i>. (By contrast, <i>Dogs</i> variants that only use the conflict resolution system, without having analogs to the town creation rules and the progression of sin, could well be "about" entirely different stuff.)<br/><br/>On the other hand games like <i>Runequest</i> (especially 3rd edition) have far less of an "aboutness" about them, in spite of being more or less tied to specific settings. The rules might be mainly about fighting, performing tasks, casting spells, and improving one's character, but the games played with those rules don't necessarily center on those activities. Essentially these are the "sim-by-habit" designs that often get a bad rap in Forge-ish circles. The people playing the games might claim their actual play is "about" political intrigue or whatever, yet the rules provide few guidelines and no mechanics for constructing intrigue-laden situations, or for maneuvering through them.<br/><br/>BTW, in this post I'm not going to say that one of these approaches is better than the other. I'm also not saying that the categories I've drawn are what should apply to the terms <i>DWM</i>, etc., or that my categories should be of interest to anyone. I'm just saying that there's still a lot of fuzziness and misunderstanding around the DWM/DWDM terminology. And that is going to muck up discussions like:<br/><br/>a) DWM or DWDM, which is better?<br/>b) How could <i>Blue Rose</i> be further developed according to DWDM precepts?<br/>c) What do we accomplish with DWDM that we can't with DWM?<br/><br/>and others.<br/><br/>Of course, as Mr. "situational definitions", I <i>would</i> say something like that.                        </div>

<blockquote>Kuma, I'm completely baffled by your analogy.<br/><br/>You think that D&amp;D is a sandbox which supports you in building anything you want, and PTA is a premade sandcastle?!? I don't get it. To me, D&amp;D is much more specific and focused than PTA. There is a very limited range of starting PCs, and very concrete guidelines for adventures (i.e. making a map and stocking it with monsters and treasure). There are a lot more premade components (monsters, treasure, spells, abilities).</blockquote>
The key to the analogy is that what you want, in the end, is a sandcastle.  There's a positive connotation (at least in game-design circles) to the idea of making a 'sandbox' for people to play in - that you're making this arena where everyone can make their dreams come true.<br/><br/>Most of the time, it's not true.  With DWM games, it's not true on purpose - you've made this game where you can do one thing, and do it very well. <i>PTA</i> is about emulating a drama show on TV - and it does a bang-up job of it.  <i>Polaris</i> is about playing a knight in a mythical North Pole at the end of their romantic period, with the world crumbling around them.  <i>Shab al-hiri Roach</i> is about playing the faculty at a college who are beset by a powerful beast.  Each of these games is completely focused on what matters - usually the relationships between the characters, within a very specific environment or structure.<br/><br/>Now, if you can grok that underlying structure, you can make a different game (the sandcastle-to-pirate-cove bit) with different window dressing that functions really well because it uses the same underlying principles as the original.  Playing Roman soldiers stuck out in Britannia, with the barbarian hordes bearing down on them and their Roman way of life crumbling - that's a possible modification for <i>Polaris</i>.  <br/><br/>DWDM in the case of <i>Polaris</i>, at least the way I'm reading it, means that Ben would have included some of these possible ports, and maybe given ways to replace one of the four quarters on the character sheet, but still be playing in the world of <i>Polaris</i>.  Or how to play the antagonists in the setting.  <br/><br/>But the more tools and options and *stuff* that you give the players in the game, the less like a sandcastle the game becomes, and more like a kit for putting together a <i>Polaris</i>-like game.<br/><br/>[... more in a minute - gotta give the little girl her breakfast.]<br/><br/>D&amp;D, on the other hand, gives you a lot of <i>stuff</i> - classes, items, monsters, magical spells and whatnot - but almost no ideas on how to put any of it together.  D&amp;D is almost completely <i>raw material</i> for creating stories, but says almost nothing on how to create those stories.  This, in my view, is what DWDM is - focusing on the texture of the bark of the tress, 10 kinds of moss and the colors of the leaves - instead of looking at the forest.<br/><br/>(I'm also going to throw in there that your conception of D&amp;D is about 5 years out of date, John.  If you leave out all of the 3rd-party d20 stuff and just focus on WotC publications (the 'core' books), you've still got an amazing panopoly of choices for creating characters and adventures - leave out everything but the PHB, DMG and MM, and you've still got more choices than you've every had before.  Limited choice of characters?  One book - 'Savage Species' alone gives you the ability to literally play any monster in the MM as a character.)<br/><br/>But all of that is really not the point - you don't want a big pile of sand and some tools - you want a damn <i>sandcastle</i>.  D&amp;D gives you shiny baubles to stick on the parapets, but doesn't give you the slightest idea how to build a sandcastle to start with - which is the root cause of a lot of problems that players and GMs wind up bitching about on forums - because there's no 'way' to play D&amp;D.  The books lean heavily on mini-based play for commercial reasons, but again - there's nothing about <i>craft</i> in the books.<br/><br/>Not only is there no real focus - there's no real themes in D&amp;D (at least in the core) - and <i>there's not even a way to help players <b>generate</b> theme</i>.  Want to play a game about the last outpost of the Kivor empire against the coming hordes and the dying of the light of civilization?  Well, we've got a Smash Goblin feat!  It's all about the <i>stuff</i> - not about <i>putting the stuff together in a meaningful way</i>.  That's what DWDM means, as I read it.                        </div>

'No plan of battle survives contact with the enemy.'  We're talking about design, not play.  I'm taking the books as they are written.  Once you start bringing in the player base, all bets are off.  After all, you're talking to the person who ran a diceless <i>Werewolf</i> game.<br/><br/>I also can't take seriously any design idea that says 'well, we're talking about everything <i>but</i> D&amp;D'.

It does though - if you were to replace 'Mistaken', you're removing that aspect of the character and changing the relationships that the parts have with one another.  or at least the relationships probably *should* change.                        </div>

No.  D&amp;D gives pretty good guidelines about how to put this together.  The 3rd edition DMG gives guidelines to make a map and populate it with encounters.  50% of encounters should be EL equal to the party level, 10% lower, 15% with EL 1 to 4 above, 5% with EL 5+ above, and 20% either easy or difficult depending on a trick.  It's got lots of examples of monsters, treasures, traps, and dungeons -- along with guidelines on how to create more.

It's true that D&amp;D doesn't have guidelines to explicitly generate theme or other story elements the way your preconceptions tell you that role-playing should be done.  You know what?  That is Design What Matters.  It is telling you to run the game differently than what you would by default.  <br/><br/>If you approach D&amp;D with the preconception that you want to play a story game with an explicit theme about the dying light of civilization -- then you're going to find it broken and/or incomplete.  You'll throw your hands up in the air and say "Where's the rules for what a protagonists Issue is?"  Your conclusion is that this game doesn't really provide what is <i>necessary</i> to play, and thus it is design what doesn't matter.  <br/><br/>That's not an issue with the design philosophy -- that's a problem with your analysis.  I'll offer this as an equally valid comparison:  Suppose you picked up Dogs in the Vineyard and wanted to play a game about the last outpost of the Kivor empire against the coming hordes and the dying of the light of civilization.  You'd equally well conclude that Dogs in the Vineyard doesn't support that.                        </div>

                            Kuma, you can either use D&amp;D to illustrate what you mean by DWDM (in which case you have to define exactly what you mean by "D&amp;D"), or you can use a fixed definition of DWDM to determine if a particular incarnation of D&amp;D fits the definition. If we can't agree on what D&amp;D is, then it's useless for illustration.<br/><br/>(Edit: IMO what you have to do to see if a game is DWDM is first to see if the game either explicitly states what matters, or implicitly states it in some way. That is, assuming you accept implicit definitions. Maybe you don't. If there's no clear statement of what the game is "about", what matters, then you've got DWDM for sure. But then suppose you do find something that the game is "about"; the next question is: do the textual rules of the game actually engage that thing that matters? I think that John's discussion of D&amp;D follows this route. Yours might, too. If so then the real disagreement is over the content of D&amp;D's rules.)<br/><br/>As for <i>Polaris</i>, I'm saying that as long as you retain the structure, you still have the same "what matters" no matter the setting. You rename "Mistaken" to "Barbarism", but you keep the fact that the player who holds that position is instructed to act to thwart the Heart character. You rename "Zeal" to "Romanitas" but you keep the fact that when the player who holds that position does something that goes against the values of Roman civilization, the "Barbarism" player can call for an experience check which can reduce the player's "Romanitas" and be used to increase other values which are functionally the same as those in <i>Polaris</i>. If you create an isomorphism in this fashion, you're still going to have a game that's about the same thing as <i>Polaris</i>. (I've read that Ben said <i>Polaris</i> is "about" activism, and with only a slight effort at interpretation, I see what he means and how any game which uses the same structure is going to be about the same thing.)                        </div>

Well, actually it does.  On p. 8 of the 3rd Ed DMG, there's a list of 'styles of play' - which range from 'Kick in the Door' to 'Deep-Immersion Storytelling'.  Actually, those are your two options, according to the DMG, those are your options, followed by 'Something in Between'.<br/><br/>The DMG tells you how to build encounters, how to populate dungeons.  The sections on adventures tell you how to string those encounters together to create an adventure, and then the next chapter tells you how to string together adventures to make a campaign.  However, I submit that this is more 'stuff' - it's just that the DMG is telling you how to make your own Stuff instead of buying another book to get more Stuff.<br/><br/>All of this, and all of the rest of the edifice that is 3.5 Edition, is Stuff - but it's stuff that's been <i><b>designed</b> to work together</i>, to make it as easy as possible for someone to hang it together in whatever form they want.  The greatest percentage of any D&amp;D publication, including Dragon Magazine, which I just finished a year's subscription to, is just more and more Stuff - options and ports and <i>raw material</i>, from which the game coalesces in the hands of the players.<br/><br/>What is missing from it is any instruction on <i>WHY</i> to put it all together - what the <i>purpose</i>, the <i>telos</i>, for playing the game is.  That is left for the groups to decide - but usually not so explicitly.  Let's look at the title headings for the first chapter of the book - 'Dungeon Mastering': 'Providing Adventures', 'Teaching the Game',  'Providing the World', 'Determining Style of Play', 'Adjudicating', 'Propelling the Game Ever Forward', 'Keeping Game Balance', 'Changing the Rules' and 'Running the Game Session'.  That is the whole of the chapter entitled 'Dungeon Mastering' - and none of it - none of it - answer <i>why</i>.  Are you playing D&amp;D to Provide a World?  Are you playing D&amp;D to Teach the Game?  Are you playing D&amp;D to Provide Adventures?<br/><br/>Most of those questions are tautological - you're playing the game to play the game.<br/><br/>I would submit that there are variant - some of the Stuff - like the Rilly Evil book and the Rilly Rilly Good book, which provide some guidance in this area - I wouldn't know directly, because I don't actually own either one.  But I own a good percentage of the rest of the core, and none of it tells you <i>why</i> - it tells you <i>how</i>, and it gives you an awful lot of very good tools for making your game new or different or to shape it in a way that pleases you - but none of it tells you <i>why</i> - nor does it even ask the question.<br/><br/>Which is why D&amp;D is a sandbox - it's a great shining pool of resources - raw materials - that you can use to build a roleplaying experience - any experience  you want (as long as it's fantasy, mind) to get out of it - but you have to irst know what you want and how to make it.  You have to know you want a sandcastle and you have to know how to build it.<br/><br/>Let's contrast that with <i>Polaris</i>, which on p. 33, the very first page of the rules, you have the very first two paragraphs, which are:
<blockquote>Polaris is a game, but it is more like a game that you would play with a small child and her toys than a competitive game like monopoly [sic], chess or soccer.  <b>The goals of playing <i>Polaris</i> are no more and no less than the goals of a child's play-pretend - to create a good story, to explore an imaginary world, and to have fun doing it.</b>.<br/><br/>But <i>Polaris</i> also differs from pretend play in a few key ways.  We are adults now, and the stories that drew us as chldren will not necessarily hold the same joy for us now.  Adult stories demand more structure, more action, and more compelling quandries for the protagonists. <b>To this end, <i>Polaris</i> has a set background and a set of rules to help you structure the story that you'll be developing, to make sure that it is satisfying, interesting and fun.</b></blockquote>
Right there.  Black and friggin' white.  <i>This is what this game was written to accomplish, and your goals for playing it should be likewise, or abandon hope, all ye who enter here.</i>  Polaris tells you, right from the get go, <i>why</i> you're playing this game, and then, after it does that, it assures you that it will tell you <i>how</i> to make this happen if your why and the game's why intersect.<br/><br/>THAT is the difference between a sandcastle and a sandox.
<blockquote>If you approach D&amp;D with the preconception that you want to play a story game with an explicit theme about the dying light of civilization -- then you're going to find it broken and/or incomplete. You'll throw your hands up in the air and say "Where's the rules for what a protagonists Issue is?" Your conclusion is that this game doesn't really provide what is necessary to play, and thus it is design what doesn't matter.</blockquote>
Nowhere does D&amp;D declare what kind of game you're going to get out of it.  As a matter of fact, it tells you in exactly six paragraphs that you can either play a mini-pushing, door-kicking hackfest, or 'deeply immersive play'.
<blockquote>Suppose you picked up Dogs in the Vineyard and wanted to play a game about the last outpost of the Kivor empire against the coming hordes and the dying of the light of civilization. You'd equally well conclude that Dogs in the Vineyard doesn't support that.</blockquote>
Um, it does.  Replace the religion with Pax Kivorana (and what it Means to be a Roman/Kivoran), and change Sin to Barbarism.  You're still upholding a nebuolous cultural ideal as stone-cold fact in the face of spreading 'corruption'.  Heck, throw in supernatural overtones that may/may not be the underlying cause.<br/><br/>Done.                        </div>

                            Kuma: except that What Matters, from a system perspective, tends to be determined by, at root, what you're explicitly rewarded for.  In Dogs, you're rewarded for going up to the edge, but not over it, for "making conflicts interesting".  In PTA, you're rewarded for amusing the other players or otherwise getting their interest.  In an inarguably DDWM game like GURPS, you're rewarded for, well, showing up, and maybe for amusing other players.<br/>
<br/>
But in D&amp;D, you're rewarded for winning challenges.  The key to getting system rewards in D&amp;D is to tind the biggest challenge you can beat, take it on, and do so.  And the system's way of handling conflict really encourages this -- without those rewards, you're going to have trouble holding your own -- or even surviving.  To move the game away from this -- -regardless- of where you are on the "kick open a door"  Immersive scale, you have to ignore or change the rules, which isn't tough...but the need to drop rules to change styles isn't a sign of a DDWM game (remember, the two terms are synonymous!); but is, in fact, a direct indicator of DWM.                        </div>

                            John, I just want to repost something I whispered to you and then lost. Slightly edited.<br/><br/>Following my advice to Kuma, above, the best way to go on would be to restate "what matters" in <i>Blue Rose</i>. Do we think that <i>Blue Rose</i> is about reproducing certain genre expectations in terms of the types of conflicts &amp; issues, as well as certain patterns of story development (increasing competency &amp; challenge, or increasing scale)? If so what are the issues we'd expect to address?<br/><br/>How did we come up with our notion of what BR is about? Was it explicit, based on ad hype and color text, or implicit, based on the rules themselves? That needs to be out in the open, but I don't think this thread is the proper place to argue whether one method is more legitimate than the other. That's what your new thread is about.<br/><br/>Based on your description of the game, I think the rules could be made to matter less by:<br/><br/>*Making level a mere characteristic of characters in the same way as attributes and skills; there might be notes indicating that level can change to reflect changes in characters, but no clear guidelines for when this should happen.<br/><br/>*Not having Conviction Points (neither a way to get them nor a way to use them). By the way, did you say how they get used?<br/><br/>*As you wrote, making combat no more involved than other resolutions, and no more or less interesting mechanically.<br/><br/>Would these improve the game? I don't think so--because based on the marketing, which I'm using as my criterion, Blue Rose does appear to be targeted at certain genre expectations. OTOH, if the game had these changes, players could take the game and use it to handle the "physics" of the game world while plugging in their own social decisions about distribution of "GM-like" authority and so forth. In practice I don't think it'd work very well--but actually that just points to how DWDM is really just an extreme on a continuum. Even a game like RQ can't really help but be about something, but it's more existential than thematic. (By which I mean, it's more about presenting the participants and their characters with broad questions of "what should I do with this game/my life?" than about focusing on particular issues.)                        </div>

                            I just wanted to throw a note in here - something turned over in my head about what DWM/DWDM is getting at and I think that I understand it a bit better now.  <br/><br/>I'll write more later.  Sorry if I've muddied the waters at all.                        </div>
