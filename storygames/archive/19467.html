It's my pleasure to announce that my labor of love, the product of well over 2 years of extensive play testing, writing, rewriting, and all of that fun stuff is finally on the brink of being Kickstarted so that it can become the beautifully illustrated, professionally formatted B&amp;W PDF and (un)dead tree book that it was always meant to be. <br/><br/>Truthfully, this post is one half promotion, and one half honest request for advice and assistance. I'm new to crowdfunding in general and Kickstarter in particular and before I get my feet wet I want to have some idea of what the reception of my game might be. It's gotten good press thus far on RPGnet, and worked quite well in playtests, so I feel confident in sharing it with my fellow storygamers and asking for your honest appraisal of my as-of-yet unborn Kickstarter. It still needs a video before I'm willing to let it hatch: <br/><br/> <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2025893540/1189028971?token=53adc6c8" rel="nofollow">Here's The Link To My Putative Kickstarter</a><br/><br/>If what you see on the Kickstarter intrigues you, don't hesitate to share it with your friends, fellow gamers, and strangers on the street who might not mind being told in great detail why my zombie apocalypse RPG is so incredibly awesome that you MUST back it now. By the same token, if you have constructive criticism, questions, mockery (hopefully not too much of that), or general advice I want to hear it. Hearing so many horror stories about failed Kickstarters has imbued me with a sense of growing dread as the launch date grows nearer; not at all unlike the feeling in one's chest as a horde of zombies approaches groaning for brains. <br/><br/>Linked below are the complete survivor creation rules, a list of the default Modus Operandi's available to Survivors to define their role in the story, a breakdown of how Conflicts are handled and what sort of Advantages you can spend successes on in Conflicts, and a kick-ass character sheet courtesy of Foxkit. Assuming the project gets funded, the formatting, font, and character sheet will all be completely redesigned to be simpler, easier to read, and easier to use. Plus, both the PDF and the softcover (un)dead tree edition will be illustrated in glorious B&amp;W by the talented artist Wendy Tigges/The Jackalope.

I intended for it to be amusing, but I definitely get where you're coming from.  Zombie Food is now Civilian, Victim is now Survivor, Survivor is now Jaded Survivor, and Jaded Survivor is now Group Leader. Hopefully those still capture the flavor of the game without being insulting or boring. What do you think?

The first one especially doesn't do anything for me. <b>Cool, I'd love more feedback on this.

Did that section strike you as not detailed enough, or not clear enough? I've been going back and forth on this for a while my first attempt at an initial funding section broke down things in greater detail (revealing things like printing cost per book, shipping cost per book etc) but I received overwhelming negative feedback on that via Kicksnarker and RPGnet. <br/><br/>That being said, I welcome a second opinion. To be honest, I found it difficult to come up with Risks and Challenges for this Kickstarter. The folks I've hired to do the work are competent and experienced in their fields, and the game itself is already written and play tested. Perhaps I'm missing something though-like I said I'm completely new to Kickstarter so if there are any hidden dangers that I should be aware of, let me know. </b><br/><br/>Just my two cents. It looks like a great project and I wish you nothing but the best!</blockquote>\n<b>Thank you for your wonderful feedback. I'm glad that you like the looks of it thus far, and I look forward to hearing more of your thoughts, especially regarding potential Risks and Challenges facing this project (because I'm probably oblivious to them) and what sort of Stretch Goals would appeal to you as a potential backer.</b><br/><br/>Also, feel free to let your friends/family/random people on the street know about it if you think they'd be at all interested.

I'm sure the amped up graphic design and the extra illustrations would be cool, but they seem a little "inside baseball". Stuff like figure flats or more PDF supplements would be more interesting to me. Actually the 2nd and 4th goal are fine. <br/><br/>As for Challenges how about inserting a task outline. Something that lets the reader know that you have a clear agenda going forward. You talk a lot about your strengths, which is good, but letting the supporter know that you understand what happens next is a good thing. Just outlining that the kickstarter will pay for layout, art, shipping, and printing (or whatever) and that you have deadlines for fulfilment to meet would be a good start. I wouldn't go into per unit prices, just a plan of action and a recognition of what you have to do. <br/><br/>As a general note realize that people who are browsing Kickstarter often don't go beyond the banner and the first few sentences. Just like a newspaper article the lead has to capture enough interest to pull the reader into the rest of the presentation.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000" title="johnthedm7000"><img alt="johnthedm7000" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000">johnthedm7000</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433164/#Comment_433164" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T01:37:20+00:00" title="May 29, 2014  1:37AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mmmm...just off the top of my head would a PDF supplement detailing an optional ruleset for playing zombies with some degree of sentience appeal to you? I myself have had a few people ask me about it, what with Warm Bodies, AAAH! Zombies, Return of The Living Dead III, Zombie Honeymoon, and all of that. I was considering doing something like that in place of the Bloody Bits, but wanted to see what people thought about slicker graphic design vs. a supplement dedicated to helping you play a zombie. <br/><br/>I actually do lay out what the Kickstarter's budget is, under Initial Funding Goals on the main pager of the Kickstarter. Should I put that closer to the top of the page, or make it more obvious? I did just add an additional mention of the fufillment dates on the main PDF, the softcover version, the fulfillment dates for the Stretch Goal supplementary material, and the reasoning behind those dates.<br/><br/>Finally, I chopped out the second paragraph of the introduction as you suggested. Upon really looking at it, it does significantly streamline the text and lets potential backers get to the bloody meat of why they'd want to support the production of my game. <br/><br/>Hopefully that takes care of the most glaring problems with the kickstarter thus far.
