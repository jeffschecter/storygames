It's like the filament in the light bulb. It's these things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vivid color</li>\n<li>A few stats and a simple die roll</li>\n<li>On a 10+, the best happens. On a 7-9, it's good but complicated. On a miss, it's never nothing, it's always something worse.</li>\n<li>The MC's agenda, principles, and what to always say.<br/>\n  ...</li>\n<li>The basic moves</li>\n<li>How harm works</li>\n<li>How experience works</li>\n<li>The MC's moves</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>We change the era to Hellenistic Persia, but break the cities up into autonomous communities ruled by Kings.  We add a lot more phantasmagoria, especially at the cracks between the cities.</p>\n<p>We do a little Dogs-like sitgen in the background.  The Gods are a dysfunctional Dogs-like town, the Kings are a dysfunctional Dogs-like town, the Sorcerers are a dysfunctional Dogs-like town, and the cities are dysfunctional Dogs-like towns.  There's even little towns - you can probably guess what they're like.</p>\n<p>We replace Hx with Dungeon World-style Bonds, although the Bonds we write wouldn't be out of place if we were playing a low-key game of In A Wicked Age.</p>\n<p>The GM, he's great, but he doesn't like structuring Fronts.  He's skilled enough to cross, weave, and add pressure the PCs.  He's making the character's lives not boring while making this world seem real.  If you looked at the game for any amount of time you'll see the ticking pressures.</p>\n<p>So far, so good.  Pretty coherent game, right?</p>\n<p>Now we add this mechanic:</p>\n<p><strong>Edit: See post 24 for the most mature version</strong></p>\n<p>Player characters (not NPCs) have a pool called their Conviction.  Conviction starts as 5 points.  You can spend 2 points of Conviction to roll 3d6 instead of 2d6.  You can spend 2 points of Conviction to re-roll.  You can spend 3 points of Conviction to interrupt and take an extra move when normally someone else would be reacting first.</p>\n<p>Getting Conviction back:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You get 2 back if you have a nice, deep, uninterrupted sleep where you're not freaked out at all.  </li>\n<li>You can get 5 back if the characters sip tea together, spend time building something together, or relax and talk candidly around a campfire (i.e. refreshment scenes).  </li>\n<li>You get 1 back when you advance.  </li>\n<li>You can buy an advance that makes your total go up to 7, and an advanced advance that makes it go up to 10. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, Apocalypse World doesn't care that a PC cares more about this roll than another.  But in this world, that care/conviction is critical.</p>\n<p>Am I breaking the game?

Uninterrupted sleep is at the MC's discretion and is only rewarding you for taking some time out of the spotlight.  If you like refresh scenes, why not make it a custom move (like opening your brain), that gives the players involved +1 or -1 Hx (their choice) or +1 forward?  That way sitting down for a chat advances your character a little and lets you build on that interaction in the future.  Advances for 7 and 10 seem like they waste the purchase of a character move only to promote hording conviction - as a purchasable character move they might work better if they gave you more at an advance but were use-or-lose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333170/#Comment_333170" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T10:56:52+00:00" title="July  5, 2011 10:56AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>** Vincent said **</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Aha.

If you like the idea of Conviction spending being really huge, and you like the idea of potentially raising the numbers for hits as Charles suggests, but just don't want to mess thing up too much...<br/><br/>Why don't you try running the numbers for rolling 2d6 (using your 0-5 dice), and then 3d6 (again, using those 0-5 dice)?<br/><br/>You can still get a 10+ on 2 dice, but it'll be really rare unless you have a good stat. You might need to raise the stats a bit, as well, if you don't want the characters to be totally useless all the time.<br/><br/>With 3 dice, though, your average is 7.5, just a bit above the usual 7. <br/><br/>That gives you room to raise the stats or the range of stats AND you can go all the way to FOUR dice if you want to, once in a while.<br/><br/>Heck, if that math doesn't please you, you can roll one regular d6 and one of your d6-1 dice for the basic roll (average roll 6, so raise all your stats by one if you want to preserve the current math for unConvicted rolls), and gives you room to add one or two d6-1 dice once in a while for effect.<br/><br/>One extra d6-1 dice gives you an average of 8.5 [6 + 2.5], nicely better than the standard but not out of the park so as to be way crazy.<br/><br/>Two extra dice gives an average of 11, which means you'll just blow through anything, but those dice going all the way to 0 means you'll still have failures often enough to be interesting.<br/><br/>2. As far as the idea goes in general, though, I like it but I the "refresh" conditions don't grip me at all. In this messed up awesome world, the way you get your way is... by going to take a nap before the big fight? Sounds kinda lame, no?<br/><br/>3. I like the "interrupt" idea, though, as John Harper says! That one's pretty solid.<br/><br/>4. Finally, is this Conviction (a spendable resource) really the way you want to handle this? Maybe something more dependable would be more in-line? For example, simply giving characters more moves makes them pretty damn powerful (like advanced AW characters). Or you can have more specific stuff like Keys that give you bonuses, "When you pursue your goal of X/follow your belief of Y/strike a blow against your hated enemy, roll an extra die."<br/><br/>It depends what you want the game to look like, of course!<br/><br/>But a "Batman gets revenge against all odds" scenario can be frustrating if depleting your resources (Conviction points) at a certain point during the rampage of vengeance means you have to stop. That kind of story often has the hero just get more and more unstoppable the more he's hurt or tired. That's the opposite of what you're outlining: people can rest and drink tea until they save up enough points to go do the one thing they want to be sure they succeed at, kick ass, and then go rest again in preparation for their next goal.<br/><br/>5. Another option comes to mind, which is rolling 2d8 instead of 2d6. You can make it dramatic, too: have everyone bring their own 2d6, but then put a brightly coloured/bigger/otherwise noticeable pair of 2d8 in the middle of the table to remind them they can spend some points to roll those any time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333239/#Comment_333239" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T16:40:43+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  4:40PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Get 3 more when you advance" feels wrong to me.

Hope it's helpful one way or another. In my experience, hacking AW generally works better when you hack as little as you need to.  The ruleset itself is already very flexible and potent, though sometimes it can be unclear how little hacking you actually need.  I almost always tend to hack deeper initially and then end up scaling back, going more with what AW already lets you do. A few custom moves go a long way.<br/><br/>I'm just now--after months of playing this game--figuring out how to hack move types that don't get used constantly, like workspaces, gigs, and fortunes/wealth. There's a lot of robustness here and I keep discovering new aspects every time I play.<br/><br/>I agree with John that "when it's not your turn, make a move anyway" is a pretty amazing concept for a move.  I'm going to have to ponder that one for a while.  Seems like it could be adapted for specific contexts too. Like: <b>Quick Draw:</b> <i>You're the fastest gun in the West. When someone draws on you, even if it's not your turn to say something, make a move right then.</i>  Check out the mixture of fictional (drawed on) and social (not your turn) triggers there!  It's crazy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333368/#Comment_333368" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T12:44:51+00:00" title="July  6, 2011 12:44PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2011 12:45PM by Ry.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><a href="/forums/profile/JWalt">@JWalt</a></p>\n<p>I figured it out - it's because back when I used it for Iron-Heroes-lite the rest of the rules were built around it.
