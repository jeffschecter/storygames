It took some time for the players to internalize the rules &amp; for us to find a form that combined the different styles of the Archipelago rules and the Warsaw scenario.<br/><br/>Some cool scenes:<br/>- The Engineer shot three students at the beginning of the game. They were left lying on the floor of the locomotive. Later in the game, the Engineer started going crazy; he wired the coaches with explosives, and sat down with a bottle of vodka and partied with the dead students. He could hear them talk; nobody else could.<br/>- The Assistant was shot in the belly very early on, and spent most of the game slowly dying. At one point, he woke up from a nightmare, all alone in the train. Next to him, twisted copper wire led to a small box. Dropping to the ground and crawling on his belly, following the wire, he found box after box of explosives. One loose wire could blow up the whole thing. Then he noticed the little pig at the other end of the coach, coming toward him. One loose wire, and he (and the pig) would be dead.<br/>- The Fireman's son was killed, and they buried him by the old mines. A sad scene with the fireman's tears running over his dirt-covered face.<br/>- The Pretty Girl, who was pregnant, lost her unborn child when she was trampled by the mob at Warsaw station. Coming to the bombed-out carriage, the scenario said someone would find something unexpectedbly valuable in the wreckage. The girl heard the soft noises of a baby crying, coming from the wreckage.<br/><br/>There were some bits that were unclear at the start of the game. <br/>- One of the characters was an assistant, but to whom? In the new version of the PDF, he's called the "Adjutant", which makes it more clear that he's with the Quiet Man. <br/>- It seems that three of the characters are unavailable at the start of the game (the Old Man, the Countess/Lady, the Pretty Girl). So the players should only choose from the 5 others? I'm not entirely sure, though.<br/>- It seems that some of the characters are more-or-less obligatory for the scenario to work well. Perhaps it should be made explicit that the Quiet Man has to be played by someone?<br/><br/>As we played, I struggled a bit with the GM role. Archipelago is a GM-less game, based on players throwing ideas at each other and incorporating them in their characters' stories. The scenario, on the other hand, is semi-railroaded: It assumes certain events will happen in a specific order. It also enforces a pacing structure where everyone gets one turn at each location. Here are some things I did:<br/>- I ended up skipping some scenes entirely, just giving a quick summary of events. This was mostly for pacing and time considerations.<br/>- Some scenes I didn't really GM, instead giving the players meta-instructions: "In this scene, these things will happen - make it so!"<br/>- Scene 9 was played over several rounds. At this stage, the players had introduced a lot of material, and the main scenario wasn't all that relevant anymore. They'd lost two of the coaches; they'd told the Nazis about the gold; they were dying and going insane. <br/><br/>The final scene had the Assistant blowing up the train. In Dark Star style, I told everyone to narrate an epilogue while their characters were flying through the air (implicitly: all dead or dying). Each epilogue was very different; my favorite was the Fireman - the player used the opportunity to answer his character's questions: "...and you all wonder why I hate the Ukrainians so much? Because they're BAAAASTAAAAAAARDS!"<br/><br/>Some of the characters reached their destinies; some didn't. It got a bit hard to focus on the destinies, all the while incorporating the written plot, fate card elements, character relationships etc. The feeling of being given a destiny by the scenario is very different from choosing one among those your friends have designed for you especially; even though we talked about them, and reminded each other of the destinies at several points, still I think only 3 of 5 characters actually got there.<br/><br/>It became very clear (to me) that the strongest points of the Archipelago engine are the two phrases "Do it differently" and "More detail". They are very strong tools to keep the vision consistent, to reach better play. At one point, one player was narrating a bunch of plot in past tense; I said "do it differently", and we got an exciting present-tense scene with a clear focus. At another point, the Fireman was mourning his son, and the scene ended quickly on a slightly silly note; I said "more detail", and the table quieted down; forced to stay in the moment, instead of awkwardly running away from it, we all experienced the Fireman's sorrow a bit more.<br/><br/>The ready-made setting element cards were great. The more abstract ones were hard to play (loyalty); the concrete ones (train, outsiders, fear) were wonderful when combined with fate cards. <br/><br/>If I run this scenario again, I'll probably...:<br/>- Make little standup cards for each character, with their name, appearance and destiny in bold letters so everyone can see them at all times.<br/>- Restructure the scene descriptions: First a few location-descriptive sentences, then a list of mandatory events, and finally a list of potential events.<br/>- Let players request scenario events on their turns, but also let them run event-less turns if they want to.<br/>- Requested events are chosen from the list by the GM.<br/>- When enough/all events are done, the GM announces that players can move the train to the next location, on their turn.<br/>The events can also be done as cards, really, and the GM eliminated entirely. This is a technique I've used a bit in a different game, and one that might work very well in Archipelago-based scenarios.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246316/#Comment_246316" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-12T06:46:23+00:00" title="December 12, 2009  6:46AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2009 6:48AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, you guys went <i>super dark!</i> <br/><br/>This is great feedback, Matthijs, and I'm glad you had fun. So many memorable moments.<br/><br/>The assumption (yeah, I know) is that anybody not played by a player is present as an NPC. If nobody wants to play the Quiet man, he's standing around being quiet.<br/><br/>It should be pretty clear about the "Quiet Man selects" character - he chooses one to be a PC, the GM chooses one to be a PC who joins in Warsaw, and the final one joins further down the line, in Rawa Ruska. If nobody chooses to play the Quiet Man, I guess the GM picks. But who wouldn't choose to play the Quiet Man? He's awesome.<br/><br/>Your impulses for tweaking scenes and adjusting for pacing, etc are spot on. That's ideal. Make it your own.<br/><br/>I don't know how to take your feedback regarding the GM - one the one hand, it confirms some of my suspicions, but on the other hand, you wrote the core game!  It makes sense that you'd drift it back that direction. I'm wondering it it is worth adding a page that explains how to play in either mode. Maybe that is the weak choice. I want some more play feedback from people who are not you or me.<br/><br/>Thanks for the write-up, very excellent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246317/#Comment_246317" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-12T07:00:57+00:00" title="December 12, 2009  7:00AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2009 7:01AM by Matthijs.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I want some more play feedback from people who are not you or me.</blockquote>\nDefinitely.

The little pig, for instance, was named Adolf; one of the players had a lot of fun making Adolf noises on suitable and unsuitable occasions, and one short sequence described the pig's inner life. Also, it turned out that the Fireman's secret skill was to play the Polish national anthem making fart noises with his hands. That was a fairly surreal scene; it took place very soon after he lost his son. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It should be pretty clear about the "Quiet Man selects" character - he chooses one to be a PC, the GM chooses one to be a PC who joins in Warsaw, and the final one joins further down the line, in Rawa Ruska.

And maybe it's just me! ...but this is how I understand it from the text:<br/>1. Before the game, all the players except one volunteer choose a PC from this set of five: Fireman, Engineer, Quiet Man, Adjutant, Conductor.<br/>2. The volunteer starts the game with no PC.<br/>3. During the first scene, the volunteer selects two characters from this set: Old Man, Countess, Pretty Girl. (The remaining one comes back much later in the game).<br/>4. From those two characters, the Quiet Man (not the GM) chooses one to be the volunteer's PC.<br/><br/>If nothing else, this serves as an example of how easy it is to misinterpret a rules text <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246323/#Comment_246323" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-12T08:38:36+00:00" title="December 12, 2009  8:38AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, that's right Matthijs.

After reading tthe initial version of Last Train and the spiffed up version, my thoughts had wandered over to components also, and how they could be made to do this differently. And each one that I considered also seemed to even further reduce a need for a consistent/permanent GM/Guide game-role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272624/#Comment_272624" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T11:52:13+00:00" title="May 23, 2010 11:52AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2010 11:52AM by nemomeme.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>It became very clear (to me) that the strongest points of the Archipelago engine are the two phrases "Do it differently" and "More detail".

Did you specifically mention that you thought the past tense plot narration was a weaker choice than some possible alternatives and did they immediately agree or was there some back and forth?

The player agreed - there's very rarely been any back-and-forth with this phrase, as far as I remember (although I've met one player who sometimes starts a discussion when he's the target of the phrase).
