<div class="Message">
                    Having been a Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri fan for many years, I was very excited when a friend suggested that we playtest Agora.  The thematic material in the game was very interesting, if just a little unpolished because it's still being worked out, and I couldn't wait to try a game where my characters' philosophical positions change as a consequence of play.<br/>
<br/>
So we ran through a Descent, and experienced the system directly.  I played a Green Uprising Ecological Engineer who had hijacked the entertainment/arcology section of a dying spacecraft and needed to somehow bring it down to the surface of the planet with its life intact.  I was opposed by a decaying orbit, a massive atmospheric storm, and the possibility that it would become necessary to sacrifice some of my subordinates in the process of survival.  My resources were optimism, creative design, a nanoforge, and a fusion core; my lieutenants were the Fabricator of Dreams and an engineering Apprentice, with a handful of followers.  Due to a few lucky rolls, the Descent went very rapidly, although some of the contested rolls took a long time to resolve.<br/>
<br/>
Agora's mechanics seem to have two major goals:  to provide a story-generation system, and to provide an entertaining game system.  Unfortunately, I don't think it fulfills either of these goals.<br/>
<br/>
The rules don't lend themselves to interesting gameplay.  If one side happens to roll well, as happened in my Descent when I rolled 2, 1, 2, there's little the other side can do to turn this around.  As the lucky roller, I had no reason to reroll these numbers, and my opponent was left futilely trying for an Epiphany or two.  Even in later rolls, there were really very few tactical or strategic options, and it was extremely difficult to perceive any meaning in the choices I made.  The extreme parsity of options at all points didn't lend itself to thoughtful or interesting gameplay at all.<br/>
<br/>
As a story-generation system, the rules are much more complex than the nature of the results they produce.  Mechanically, they determine which of two competing sides gets to decide what happens, and as a side benefit whether specific resources (whose properties are otherwise undefined) can be included in the narrative.  Except for Epiphanies, which determine when faction philosophies must be changed, there's little that couldn't be accomplished by flipping a coin.  The rules don't seem to inform or be informed by the narrative at all.  Obviously the quality of any player-generated story is going to depend heavily on the players, but this system did little more than identify who got to determine how part of the story turned out, and everything about the story had to be determined by the players' own imaginations.  The narrative is an overlay placed atop the rule system but not really connected to it, and we really don't need a dice-rolling mechanic to exercise our imaginations in communal storytelling.  The nature of our resources could be flexible or limited, specialized or universally-applicable, and their mechanical representations would behave exactly the same way.  The process of resolution takes far too much time and effort for the quality of resolution it provides.<br/>
<br/>
In short, I like the idea of the game very much.  I believe the mechanics need to be almost completely reworked or scrapped altogether, though.  I would be very interested in hearing from anyone who has tried the game and has suggestions for productive change.                </div>

<p>Cool writeup. I liked the system more when I played it, but I also recognize some of the things you saw (like the effects of a very lucky roll). Aside from the dice/conflict mechanics, how did you feel about the other parts of the game, and the general way the play was structured? Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking turns to make Challenges/Stands</li>
<li>How conflict fallout could change your Ideals (did you experience this in play?)</li>
<li>The sharing of the GM/oppositional role</li>
</ul>

                            Hmm...  I'm sort of guessing here because you didn't say otherwise, but...  What were your other dice besides your 1,2,2 in that first roll?  Because, you know, you lose that 1 as soon as you use it, so you should only have had 2,2 and maybe another 2 or 3.<br/><br/>Also, while it's not clearly noted in the text, the Descent Obstacles have really weak stats.  It takes some enormously lucky rolling by the opposition, and unlucky rolling by the faction in order to lose the Descent.  I recommend you try at least a couple standard Obstacles before passing judgment.  When the other side has enough dice, they'll often have enough time to roll a lucky block of 1s and destroy your block of low dice, turning the tide.<br/><br/>Or that's been my experience so far.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Hey, Caledonian, thanks for playtesting!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to hear the game didn't live up to your expectations on your first go.  Thomas has already raised some questions on why that might have been -- did you discard that pesky 1 after your first challenge?  And did you go beyond your Descent?  The Descent scene is only supposed to get your feet wet; it's a tutorial designed to display the dice system, but it is not the game itself by any means.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to talk with you in more detail!                        </div>

                            Yes, 1's were being discarded correctly. But after the first exchange Matt had three 2's, which reduced the rest of the scene to my trying to roll lower as the Descent. Even when I did, I still didn't have enough low dice to remove any of his (4,4,3,1 if I recall). We were going to try to an obstacle, but I ran into a problem rolling an example one up. What do you do when you have 2d6 and 6d8 in positions, but only one position? I'm willing to play a few more scenes with Matt once that gets cleared up. <br/>
<br/>
However, I retain similar reservations about the mechanic. When one side gets lucky, then the other sides just have to keep rolling hoping that they will get equally or even more lucky, all the while their chances of doing so are diminishing. It seems the complexity of the mechanic serves to disguise this, but doesn't lend itself to story elements, as such. I intentionally did add those when I did my Descent scene with Thomas, such as explicitly removing his Marines when I was turning them to my side in the narration, but that sort of thing is made more difficult by the general pooling of ideal and resource dice. <br/>

                            Mendel, if you have two kinds of dice and only one Position to invest them in, you only use one kind of dice.  The others are lost.<br/><br/><em>When one side gets lucky, then the other sides just have to keep rolling hoping that they will get equally or even more lucky, all the while their chances of doing so are diminishing.</em><br/><br/>This is actually by design -- you're overlooking an option, though.  When one side gets lucky, the other side has to choose whether to push things by continually rolling (and risking) dice in the hopes of getting lucky, or they can surrender the stakes, take their +1 die to an ideal, and try for an epiphany for later.  A great deal of the game revolves around "How much do I want those stakes?" and pulling out of a conflict when it's no longer worth staying in it.<br/><br/>In Alpha Centauri, sometimes you get into wars with the other factions, and you go in thinking you can win or take X number of cities or whatever, but as time goes on and you're losing units, that becomes more and more unlikely, and at some point you've just got to call the other faction leader and propose a peace treaty.  That's what I'm going for here.<br/><br/>Sometimes pulling out is your best option.  Pulling out rewards you with an ideal die (which <em>never goes away</em>, unlike resource dice) and if you lost a lot of resources to burnout, probably an epiphany that can help you whomp on them in a later scene.<br/><br/>That make any sense?  Players will pull out of conflicts, especially against Obstacles that rolled high for their die pools, all the time.  It's not a crushing defeat, it's just a setback, and one that gives them some ammunition for the rematch.                        </div>

                            Hmm, doesn't whether its a crushing defeat depend on the stakes? I mean, if the stakes you'd be accepting is the complete destruction of you and your faction, then you'll likely not surrender early. And even then, while you still have hope, you end up doing is re-rolling all the dice you can as often as you can, which generally isn't so much fun. I suspect the key question is what can be lost to stakes?<br/>
<br/>
As far as my descent, the IC log is up on Thomas' wiki. I'm intrigued by the fact that I had a particularly long descent, mostly due to my horrible rolls at the beginning. Also, I think it may have helped that we forgot to declare stakes during my descent. As a result I assumed that Thomas' stakes were basically the destruction of my people, which meant I had to push for victory even with the dice against me much of the way. I managed to eek out some victories, and finally won through sheer numbers of dice. Considering I was tempted to go for losing the descent (it gives you a better reward, in my opinion), it was better that we didn't know each others stakes. <br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed the scene, but I found some frustration in things ending too abruptly. The real disadvantage of the surrender is that it finalizes things with a sort of "nevermind." A muting, that is only partially remedied by the twist. Indeed Thomas narrated his cliffhanger exactly as I was planning to take the next few challenges.<br/>
<br/>
So I found it fun, but it raised some concerns. I'm planning to see how those evolve as I play further.<br/>

<em>if the stakes you'd be accepting is the complete destruction of you and your faction, then you'll likely not surrender early.</em><br/><br/>That's why you shouldn't set those as stakes!  Stakes should never be anything that would kill your enjoyment of the game if they were to occur.  Looking at the playtest document, though, it looks like I assumed that and didn't spell it out, which I'll be sure to correct.  Thanks for catching that.<br/><br/>In any case, when you're setting up the stakes of the current scene, each side should declare their stakes and the other side should feel free to say, "Whoa, I can't accept those stakes -- it'd kill the game for me."  And then reframe the stakes into something that will make for a more interesting and engaging story for everybody.                        </div>

                            Mendel, myself, and a friend attempted a three-way Obstacle after the friend went through his own Descent.  The playtest was called because none of us wanted to proceed to wrestle with the mechanic any longer.<br/>
<br/>
We've been careful to play by the rules, and I am quite confident that my problem is indeed with the mechanic, not our implementation of the mechanic.  It's just too complex with too little payoff.                        </div>

                            Honestly, I think you've had all of the detail you need.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanic is a rather unpleasant grind, the first few rolls usually determine who's going to win and there are no real ways to reverse the death spiral, its strategic options are few and are likely to become available only after the likely winner has already been determined, it doesn't inform the story well, and in general seems to require the expenditure of far more resources than it produces in benefit.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like an expansion on any of these points, feel free to ask.                        </div>

                            When you're in a conflict, there are two things you can do:<br/>
* roll in new dice from a trait (and bringing this trait into your narration)<br/>
* reroll some dice on your side<br/>
<br/>
The first does seem to inform the story fine, more or less as in Dogs, where a raise is informed by the resources you've just called in, if any.<br/>
<br/>
The second, however, has no fictional component to it; it's merely something you do.<br/>
<br/>
Another important thing is that initial success on your dice is never reduced by simply staying in the conflict, but only by great success on the part of the opposition, and a enough success can buffer against the success of the opposition. (Contrast with Dogs: I can make a big raise that costs you a lot of dice, but after that, we've both used up some resources, and I can't just sit on the result I'd gotten.)                        </div>

                            Dev -- rerolling dice is supposed to represent you reshuffling the resources that you've already got on the table, whether that be moving machineguns into position or twisting the knife in your debate.  Which is usually what gets narrated in the challenge or stand that you create out of the new dice.  It's not explicitly stated in the rules text because it sort of happens on its own, but it might be a good idea to highlight it so the players are more conscious of what's happening.<br/><br/>Also, Dev, when you're in a conflict, there's another option: surrender.  And it's sometimes the most strategic option available.<br/><br/>Caledonian -- no, actually, I don't have much information from you outside of your initial die rolls and your general comment that the resolution system was a grind for you.  Things that might help me actually understand what was happening might include: other die rolls you made later, what ideals and resources you rolled in, what the stakes were in the conflicts in question, and how you directed the challenges you made (against the obstacle or the other player or both).  I'm ecstatic that you playtested the game, but so far the information you've provided me has not been enough for me to figure out what went wrong in your game.<br/><br/>I strongly suspect that you were trying to play Agora like it was D&amp;D or Shadowrun or Sorcerer or Dogs, where it's your job as a player to throw yourself at the problem and overpower it by dint of your role as a protagonist of the story.  Agora really really doesn't work that way.  It's far more about choosing your conflicts wisely, knowing when to push and when to walk away.  But until I actually know more about what happened, I can't really say, "Oh, you were approaching conflicts like a rockstar, and got thrown in the gutter after your single didn't hit the Top 40."                        </div>

                            I will attempt to make things clearer, hopefully that will help.<br/>
<br/>
The major problem with the mechanic was that, especially in a table-top context it is tedious. For each stand there is likely to be a few rolls and a few pauses to check and recheck your sums, both of your own dice and of your opponent(s). Then you come back to it, and add your narration. This seemed an inordinate amount of work for narrate something "this" good using "these" elements. And frankly the core mechanic of adding up to 7 doesn't evoke anything about the game, and it's a might bit complex for a generic mechanic. So after you spend 2-3 minutes figuring out what your set looks like, you then look over at the other play and try to get back into the swing of the plot. <br/>
<br/>
In IRC and the Mush, you at least can look at the log and get back quickly, not to mention you expect to wait longer for giving and recieving responses. Regardless of the statistics of the mechanics they seemed to be generic and they felt tedious to us, and frankly they were not fun. I really like the possibilities of Agora, I've been hunting for my Alpha Centauri disk since last week because of it. Matt and Mike are even more interested in the genre, and they (especially Matt) are very interested in creating societies. I would fully expect that they are fairly representative of the target audience.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the mechanics, I believe Thomas about upsets being reasonably common, but I think the death spiral is not alleviated by that. After all the death spiral is due to the fact that the likelihood of an upset decreases (and here we should consider all unrolled dice as well as rolled ones) as time goes on. This is clearly intended by Joshua here, because of the importance of surrender.<br/>
<br/>
As far as how to play Agora protagonists? Choosing wisely only matters if players feel there is some strategy to it. If it's just I'm losing, and I'm tired of losing, so I'll surrender. What would really, really help the game is a section on strategy, because if there is a deep strategy going on, it's pretty much lost in the time frame where I can try to get a handful of players interested in continuing with a game of Agora. <br/>
<br/>
The take home here is, if you require players to spend 2-3 minutes making largely mechanical decisions between their involvements with the imagined stuff, they should at least feel that those decisions matter, or don't interfere with their involvement with the imagined stuff. Otherwise it quickly becomes tedious and unfun. <br/>

                            So let me double-check that I'm hearing this right:<br/>
<br/>
1. The time needed to roll dice and construct a Challenge or Stand took too long for the preferences of the players.<br/>
2. The decision on whether or not to roll in new dice or reroll current dice did not appear to be a decision that mattered.<br/>
3. The same decision did not appear to have a strong link to the fiction.<br/>
<br/>
Now, assuming that I'm hearing all that right, it seems that #1 is probably caused by #2 and #3.  There should be a lot of suspense at the table, waiting to see if the conflict pushes the player into risking more to gain the stakes.  Every decision to roll dice is a risk, and those dice all represent something that the player cared about enough to put on their character sheet.  The player is thinking "Is risking Geneva my AI personal assistant worth the potential payoff of hacking into that communications array?" or "Should I put my Faith on the line here to stand up to this would-be emporer, or should I let it pass?"<br/>
<br/>
I'll look into ways of making that sort of thing more transparent.  Thanks for the feedback, guys.                        </div>

                            I'm not sure if transparency is what you should going for in that. Am I wrong to believe that the intended premise of the game is "How will you live?" I suspect part of the problem is that "What are you willing to gamble to get your way?" is a very different premise, so when we play looking for the former one, we find it unsatisfying when we spend so much time mucking only with the later. <br/>

<br/>
'Grind' is a qualitative assessement of a mathematical phenomenon.  It really doesn't matter what names I gave to my groups of dice, nor what objects or concepts those names referred to.  Agora's mechanic tends to lead to a) rapid determiniations of which side will come out on top, in which case I didn't feel that I had any real influence over the outcome because most of the strategic decisions in the game statistically appear only after several die rolls, and b) drawn-out sequences in which the various sides fight desperately, slowly losing their resources (whether material or conceptual) in a fight that no one can afford to lose and eventually that no one can afford to win.<br/>
<br/>
If the Challenges and Stands don't involve things that our factions would be desperately concerned about, what's the point?  Sure, not everything is going to be a life-or-death struggle.  Sure, it's good to avoid stakes that would ruin the fun of players completely.  But if we limit the stakes so that no one will ever be upset about losing them, then we won't care about winning them either.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the fun of Alpha Centauri is that the various ideological conflicts feel very real because they have very real and very serious consequences.  Miriam's loathing of Gaia's Stepdaughters doesn't just manifest as a few sharp words at an afternoon tea, they mean that the Lord's Believers will try to subvert Deidre's society.  Yang wants to dominate all life, turning everything into an extension of his personal will, and if he has to exterminate every other faction, so be it.<br/>
<br/>
The tension between the story-generation and game aspects of Agora is something I see as a serious problem.  You don't try to win a story.  You try to win a game.                        </div>

<b>Mendel --</b><br/>Lemme reframe a bit.  Instead of "What are you willing to gamble to get your way?" think of it as "Is this thing that I wanted worth gambling the people and culture that I lead and protect?"  To cast it in a modern light, is spreading democracy to Iraq worth gambling the safety of American troops or the prosperity of the oil-addicted populace?  Every single decision in this game is a value judgement -- is this more important than that, is this worth that, if I sacrifice this what am I left with?<br/><br/><b>Caledonian --</b><br/>Two of your comments, "It really doesn't matter what names I gave to my groups of dice" and "a fight that no one can afford to lose" tell me a lot about your game.  It sounds like you set up some very black-and-white stakes, one of which you needed and one of which you couldn't bear.  Since you absolutely had to win, all of the resources on your sheet became equal, not just in terms of power to win the conflict, but in terms of what they meant to you as a player.  Since you absolutely had to win, it didn't matter what your dice were assigned to, because their only value was to help you win the conflict that you couldn't afford to lose.<br/><br/>Assuming Mendel correctly characterized your experience, it's no wonder that the individual decisions that you made did not seem to matter or engage in the fiction.  They didn't.  All that mattered was throwing dice at your opposition so you didn't have to take the intolerable counterstakes.<br/><br/>(Also, did you <em>name</em> your lieutenants, or simply give them positions?  Once you name people, they tend to develop personalities that you care about, instead of remaining warm bodies in hierarchical positions there to do your bidding. I should probably make sure the rules text directs players to give their lieutenants names rather than just positions.)<br/><br/>Now, if you wanted to give the game another try (which you very well may not, and I'd certainly understand), I'd suggest you very carefully select stakes, not so much in terms of what stuff your guy needs to acquire in order to survive and thrive, but the means by which you the player would like to see your character survive and thrive.  Counterstakes then would shuttle him in a different direction -- not that he gets shut down and fails to acquire the resources he wanted, but that he gets shunted into a different situation that still affords him some interesting, if different, options.<br/><br/>As an example: your eco-engineer is on the surface of the planet with his terrarium of plant and animal life.  A group of refugees comes to seek shelter.  Your stakes might be that you bring them into the arcology and teach them how to live in balance with the ecosystem within; the counterstakes could be that they can't hack living in balance, and settle outside surrounding the arcology, still part of your group but not within the arcology like your original followers.  Since you're not dealing with life-or-death stakes, the situation that evolves becomes far more nuanced, allows the question of whether risking a lieutenant's patience and skill is worth educating some ignorant refugees.  At that point, you're addressing "how shall we live?" rather than "will we live?"<br/><br/>That make any sense?                        </div>

                            For clarification these are paraphrases of the stakes used:<br/>
<br/>
Matt's Descent - Landing<br/>
<br/>
"We safely land our terrarium on Agora" vs. "You are forced to choose between your people and the terrarium." <br/>
<br/>
Mike's Descent - Battle<br/>
<br/>
"We evade the patrol and land safely on Agora." vs. "You land safely on Agora by stealing the prison craft you were placed in."<br/>
<br/>
Later Scene -<br/>
<br/>
"We trade with each other enough to make  people become dependant on the trade." vs. "Bandits raid the caravan."<br/>
<br/>
Not really, absolutely must win situations.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the premises, you're claiming that they share some common overlap, as far as I can see that's reasonable. It's also part of the problem. Remember, Agora is described with the "How will you live?" premise, not the "Are the things I want worth gambling such things as the people I protect, the culture they follow, or the gadgets I have?" I mean, you could always go, "What will you gamble to survive?" Then you'd be consistent about it. But admittedly, that would be a game I am much less interested in playing. <br/>

                            Well, these might have been must-win situations.<br/><br/>Would choosing between the terrarium and his people have ruined the game for Matt?  Would he want to continue playing after having chosen one way or the other?<br/><br/>How important was it to Matt that his people were self-sufficient in terms of food?  Would he want to continue playing dependent on somebody else?<br/><br/>Intolerable stakes don't have to be life-or-death, even though that's an easy way to characterize them.  In a generic fantasy game, a warrior losing his arm might be more intolerable than an honorable death, after all, since it would create a character the player had no interest in playing or even remembering.                        </div>

                            If none of the situations are important enough to my character that I should care how the mechanics turn out, why in the world should I work my through a frustrating grind mechanic to determine the outcome?  For that matter, why should I care whether I surrender or not?  The only real purpose to surrendering is to conserve resources for future conflicts -- if those conflicts don't matter to me either, why should I care how many resources I have to deal with them?<br/>
<br/>
If I care about the outcome to *any* degree, I need to work out the mechanics.  The alternative is to sit passively and accept whatever alternatives are presented by surrendering.  That doesn't involve me in a game, and it doesn't involve me in a story I've helped create.  In fact, since the others are trying to create interesting conflicts by offering undesirable alternatives, I've forced them to create a story in which a faction identified with myself passively accepts a series of unfortunate events.  That's not fun for me, and it's not fun for them.<br/>
<br/>
Don't give me this "your playstyle is inferior" garbage.  As far as the dice mechanics are concerned, it doesn't matter what they're named -- they necessarily lead to tedious, repetitive rolling that takes ages to reach any conclusion whether  I refer to them as "Marah, the girl I rescued from the burning ship who sees me as a replacement parental figure" or "Joe Schmoe".  Before I can resolve the narrative, I need to know how the dice turn out.  If the only ways to escape that grind are to constantly surrender, utterly striping away any interest I might have in the stakes, or quit, then I should just throw down the system in disgust and make up stories on my own.<br/>
<br/>
At present, I see nothing about the system that makes it any better to making up stories by myself or with others; in fact, having this system strikes me as worse than having no system at all.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll just go back to imagining terraforming crews debate the ethics of constructing Moisture Condensers while keeping watch for Mindworms.  Alpha Centauri ho!                        </div>

                            One thing is sort of confusing me.  I think both of you guys have mentioned 2 to 3 minutes of dice stuff between Challenges and Stands.  Is that an actually accurate figure?  Because in my one chance to play locally with actual dice, 20-30 seconds has been the end of dice work between narrations...<br/>

                            As a quick observation: this thread is straying into a dangerous middle ground between "honest feedback" and "tearing the game apart".<br/>
<br/>
All I'm saying is: be nice. Roleplaying games produce strong feelings, so it can be an effort to keep discussion polite, but (I think) it's important.<br/>

<br/>
You realize the best scene I've played in so far was over a must-win situation? Albeit it was an implicit stake. I think the key concern is that, while the mechanic is very clever, it doesn't seem flexible in either its way of informing the narration, nor its tactical engagement. This limits enjoyably playing it to a very particular balance of the two. This game either needs considerable work to ensure that this balance can reliably be found, or the mechanic needs to be made more flexible. Otherwise, I suspect many people will find the crunch hollow, all breadth, and no depth in either the story or the tactics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thomas,<br/>
<br/>
Three minutes was the upper bound. Baring obvious situations where you were already winning my a significant margin, I doubt the dice work ever finished in under a minute. Regardless the cognitive issue was the real problem, constantly switching between the narration and the dice so totally was a strain on enjoyment of either. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Graham, <br/>
<br/>
Agreed, let us endevour to keep attacks on people and games out of this thread.  <br/>

<br/>
Sometimes giving honest feedback *requires* tearing the game apart.  Otherwise, we guarantee that the games that most need massive amounts of constructive criticism will sit unchallenged, because everyone feels that if they can't say something nice they shouldn't say anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
And how shall we respond to a poster who insists that he doesn't have enough information to evaluate a criticism, yet somehow infers enough about the critic's playstyle to discard the criticism?<br/>
<br/>
All I know is that having previously lost my enthusiasm for trying to play the game, I have now lost all enthusiasm for trying to improve it.  I'll leave you to your discussion.                        </div>

                            Quoted from one of Josh's earlier posts:<br/>
<br/>
"I strongly suspect that you were trying to play Agora like it was D&amp;D or Shadowrun or Sorcerer or Dogs, where it's your job as a player to throw yourself at the problem and overpower it by dint of your role as a protagonist of the story. Agora really really doesn't work that way. It's far more about choosing your conflicts wisely, knowing when to push and when to walk away."<br/>
<br/>
Well, it seems to me that Josh is suggesting that I'm an unwise player who doesn't choose his conflicts carefully and attempts to deal with all obstacles through sheer power.  Further, I am apparently unable to examine the structure of a game and craft an appropriate strategy, so I reflexively respond to every game I come across as being D&amp;D.<br/>
<br/>
I think his intention was perfectly clear.                        </div>
