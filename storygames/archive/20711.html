I'm playing a rogue. I hit XL:3 and had to pick a "rogueish archetype" \u2013 <del>burglar</del> thief, assassin, or arcane trickster. Oops. My character was definably  <i>not</i> any of those things. My character's alignment is chaotic good. They have probably never stolen anything except as a prank; they had definitely never killed a human or demihuman until XL:4, and they didn't know any magic besides a racial cantrip.<br/><br/>"So why is this character a rogue?", I hear you say. Well, it's because the character is definably not a barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. Rogue was just the closest fit, mechanically.<br/><br/>I ended up picking the "arcane trickster" archetype since it only changed my character's skill set, and not their personality or backstory. Except now, of course, my rogue suddenly knows magic.<br/><br/>\u2026<br/><br/>Anyway, it was very jarring from a role-playing perspective. I don't want to make this a specific gripe about the rogueish archetype class feature in 5e, or about the classes in 5e, or even about D&amp;D, since I think character advancement in a lot of systems has the potential to throw some wrenches in the works of role-playing.<br/><br/>I know there <i>are</i> systems that do this better (IMO this is one of the things that FATE gets right), but I'm more interested in the question of how you, personally, role-play character advancement in a system that forces your hand a bit (or a lot).<br/><br/><small>(edit: it's "thief", not "burglar")</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454943/#Comment_454943" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T19:31:56+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  7:31PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this is one of the things I like in Fate too, that you only switch out.<br/>But...

Look over the numbers for the "burglar" and the "assassin" and see if it's possible to interpret those numbers as fitting my character even though the label (e.g. "burglar") doesn't fit. Then it's just a matter of telling the other players, "Hey, I'm now a 'burglar', according to the rules, 'on paper'. But my <i>character</i> isn't one - he's not actually burglar at all. Cool? Please don't forget that."<br/><br/>2. Try to enjoy the "discovery" process of what the rules are pushing on me. ("Hmmm, ok. Looks like I have to be a burglar/arcane/whatever now. What does that imply about my character?") Maybe it's a change of heart or it will lead me to roleplay my character differently. I'd try to fit it into his personality and work with it: maybe he's so angry at the Bad Guy in my campaign that he becomes obsessed with thoughts of murder. It is coming from a somewhat good place (the desire to stop the Bad Guy), but he goes too far and starts turning darker: he now thinks that killing humans is worthwhile, because it's preparing him to stop a Bigger Evil. He's twisted into something I didn't expect, and I see what mileage I can get out of that.<br/><br/>3. Work with the other players and the DM to see if we can retcon or add something to the fiction to make it fit. ("Hey, how about your character's been trying to teach me some magic over the last few years, because she believed in me? It never worked... until suddenly, today, some magical power responded to the exercises! And we'll take it from there...")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454946/#Comment_454946" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T20:21:40+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  8:21PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not create your own archetype? Doesn't seem that hard, and creatively speaking it seems like the superior option. This is also, of course, exactly how I deal with this issue myself in this type of game: when the game's supported mechanical options happen to lack the literary idea that we're actually playing, obviously we'll expand the mechanical chassis to cover the lack.<br/><br/>Is your character a scout, fictionally speaking? I'm just guessing because that's often what the character background on a good rogue boils down to. Doesn't seem that difficult to eyeball what the archetype thing does in 5th edition (I don't even know, haven't read the class description for Rogue) and just slot in a new "Scout" archetype that instead of confusing your character concept actually <i>expresses</i> it.<br/><br/>The other thing I like to do when appropriate is to be a hard-ass about the logic of power in the game. By "logic of power" I simply mean, why is it that your character can do these things he does? Maybe a Rogue can only be a powerful hero by being a criminal, maybe that's the source of his mojo so to speak. A character wanting to be a rogue without being a burglar is like a paladin who doesn't want to be honorable - they'll need to switch classes! From this perspective one could interpret the D&amp;D tradition of not having a vanilla "Adventurer" class as a deliberate choice and statement about the kind of world and fiction the game has: if you want to be powerful, you either commit to the gods, become a bookworm, become a mercenary or become a criminal. It's a cynical world-view, and the early D&amp;D certainly supports the idea that the game is set in a pretty cynical world.<br/><br/>(For the record, my homebrew D&amp;D specifically replaces Rogue/Thief with an "Adventurer" that conceptually also encompasses Indiana Jones <i>exactly</i> because it doesn't make a lot of sense for most campaigns to explicitly not support the concept of a goody-two-shoes heroic swashbuckler who isn't a soldier.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454951/#Comment_454951" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T21:23:24+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  9:23PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Eero -- just confer with the DM and make up your own archetype.

(We're at XL:5 by now.)\n<blockquote>1. Look over the numbers for the "burglar" and the "assassin" and see if it's possible to interpret those numbers as fitting my character even though the label (e.g. "burglar") doesn't fit.</blockquote>\nSome of the characters in our campaign were designed that way, since they were carried over from a mostly freeform scenario. We have a character who is mechanically a Forest Gnome Warlock, but fictionally he's a Keebler elf whose "demonic patron" is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_LaPierre" rel="nofollow">Wayne LaPierre</a> and his Eldritch Blast cantrip is really just a pistol.\n<blockquote>3. Work with the other players and the DM to see if we can retcon or add something to the fiction to make it fit. </blockquote>\nYeah, this is roughly what I ended up doing. We were kind of handwavey about it, but the idea was that I had recently lost a chess game to a demon and was bound by a geas as a result, so maybe the demon either purposely granted me magical powers in order to fulfill my task, or the powerful magic just kind of rubbed off on me. It was a stretch, though, mainly because of the timing.\n<blockquote>Why not create your own archetype? </blockquote>\nI'm completely on board with that approach, but in this case the GM had said at the outset that he was strongly against custom classes and such, mostly on the grounds of mechanical balance. Apparently he'd had some bad experiences with custom classes / class features completely overshadowing the other PCs and overpowering the opposition\u2026 although by now he's repeatedly stated that this group is the least powergame-y group he's played with. But in general I think that the other players in this group (and the DM) just aren't comfortable creating "custom" systems or system elements. They'd rather shoehorn the fiction into the rules-as-written.\n<blockquote>\u2026 my homebrew D&amp;D \u2026</blockquote>\n\u2026 sounds excellent, from what I've read about it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454953/#Comment_454953" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T21:38:45+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  9:38PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>(For the record, my homebrew D&amp;D specifically replaces Rogue/Thief with an "Adventurer" that conceptually also encompasses Indiana Jones <i>exactly</i> because it doesn't make a lot of sense for most campaigns to explicitly not support the concept of a goody-two-shoes heroic swashbuckler who isn't a soldier.)</blockquote>\nI've gone a similar route in my "homebrew" D&amp;D.

The longer a game goes on, the more it can gain by taking personal responsibility for adapting the rules to the desired fiction.)<br/><br/>In that kind of creative environment my own recommendation would be to simply not bring in concepts that aren't on the official list of playing pieces: make characters, places, monsters, treasures out of the building blocks that do have the official stamp of approval, and just outright put instinctive personal creativity out of your mind. I would feel constant counter-productive frustration if I were being blue-balled constantly by having good ideas and then checking the directory to see if they're currently supported by the game text; much easier to stop having those ideas and instead just go to the directory in the first place and pick and choose from the alternatives offered there.<br/><br/>Thus, for instance in this case, I'd probably just pick the least appalling of the Rogue archetype choices, and play that to the hilt. Probably I'd develop a sordid tale about the pecuniary difficulties of my character, and how those led him to a sad career of robbery, murder, confidence games, street drugs and sodomy. If that's what the game supports, then by Jove my character shall be the best Rogue he can be!<br/><br/>(Admittedly my playstyle in this context tends towards hopelessly satiric soon enough - it's some sort of pressure valve psychology, the only way I can deal with having to play a corporate cookie-cutter character balanced by official game design masters is by expressing the character in a manner right out of Discworld or something.

I myself, for example, would find it cooler if my character was so skilled that he could do what is strictly-speaking impossible, instead of having a magic spell that allows him to cheat the laws of nature by speaking rote litanies or whatever it is that an arcane trickster does to perform his spells. The spell thing is a lazy explanation that doesn't really argue for my character being cool, you know? For a wizard it's different, he's so amazingly intelligent and driven that he's willing and able to seize divine secrets for himself and utter the blasphemies to twist nature - that's cool in its own way, like a fantasy version of a heroic scientist. The explicit flavour of the arcane trickster, on the other hand, seems to be that he's a dabbler in magic, and apparently doing magic is so trivial that he can get somewhere without any appreciable commitment to it. He's like the half-ass of heroic archetypes <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Of course, a simple solution would be to pretend that all of your magical confidence trickster's spells aren't actually that - use the mechanics, ignore the fluff. Your character's not casting <i>Sleight of Hand</i>, he's actually performing sleight of hand because he's so skillful. The main problem traditionally is that it becomes difficult to explain the arbitrary usage limit per day; perhaps the best approach to that is to pretend that doesn't exist either. In 4th edition D&amp;D it was a sort of a narrative conceit that your character just never happened to have an opportunity to do his cool moves more than once per combat or day. Maybe you could do that move all day long in a practice field, but in real combat it depends on your enemy giving you just the right sort of an opening, and fiction-wise we're pretending that this is what's preventing you from using your special snake venom strike, instead of a spell-slot mechanic. So it's not your ability to perform the move that's limited to once per combat, it's the enemy's willingness to fall for that trick. This sort of mental acrobatic may not be ideal, but it may help some people swallow the somewhat artificial fantasy scheme of D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454972/#Comment_454972" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T23:57:39+00:00" title="July  9, 2016 11:57PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2016 11:59PM by JDCorley.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Aesthetics"?

It's difficult for a person to convince themself to think in a certain way if they don't want to, there's no payoff to doing so, and thinking in a different way seems more interesting and relevant to them. We might as well question why some people don't like hobbits and think that they're jokey and lame.<br/><br/>Besides, the fact that there exists a fantasy setting in which something fits well doesn't mean that the same trope is a good choice for every setting and character concept out there. I think that it is very valid for a player to say that they don't like their choices in building up a D&amp;D rogue or D&amp;D wizard or whatever, despite the fact that the exact same kind of rogue or wizard was used in some literary work that has been accepted as canonical geek fare. As I explained earlier, my solution (the obvious solution to my mind) is to learn the rules system and expand it to support the kinds of things you want to see.<br/><br/>Not that this proves anything, but I want to say that the original creative context of the D&amp;D mechanical framework, as far as we can discern, was fluid and responsive to fictional developments: Gygax apparently introduced both Clerics and Thieves into the game specifically because the idea of playing a different sort of character emerged, and as a response the GM (with more or less player input) designed a new character class to regulate and formalize the character idea. So the answer to a player's desire to play a different type of character specifically was not that the pre-existing options are already plenty good, making the desire illegitimate; rather, the group apparently felt that there was value in an individual's aesthetic ideas, enough to go to the trouble of introducing whole new character classes into the game. After all, they could have decided instead that there's plenty of good fantasy literature out there where vampire hunters are essentially just fighting-men, so anybody wanting to play one should just make up a fighting-man character instead of advocating for this Cleric idea.\n<blockquote>Well, the nice thing about Pathfinder and 5e cantrips is that you actually can cast them all day!

Maybe it's not telekinesis, but rather ordinary sleight of hand: you distract the attention of the witnesses and move stuff by hand when they're not looking (perhaps shoot at the things with a hidden blowpipe or something, if necessary).<br/><br/>I could see myself getting into the creative challenge of denying that my character knows magic, really.

In order to cast a Fireball spell, they must make preparations, like carry around a bottle of explosive liquid (perhaps the tears of a dragon?), and so on - making careful attempts to "prepare" the environment and potential combat areas so as to have their most useful spells available.<br/><br/>In a way, it could grow to resemble the concept of "glamour" (or self-hypnosis): you only need the trappings necessary to create a strong enough *belief* in the possibility of something happening. The power of your belief does the rest.<br/><br/>Perhaps you build yourself a set of wings and strap them on in order to cast your "Fly" spell. Perhaps for your Polymorph Self spell, you must spend weeks preparing an appropriate costume. It is this preparation which allows you to convince reality that your attempt is valid, and therefore should fool the very gods.<br/><br/>(It would be an interesting way to reframe "clerical" magic, in any case...)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455000/#Comment_455000" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-10T22:15:08+00:00" title="July 10, 2016 10:15PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now you have me looking through Moldvay and trying to figure out a non-magical justification for every spell\u2026 Detect Magic seems like it would lead to some anagnorisis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455001/#Comment_455001" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-10T22:31:46+00:00" title="July 10, 2016 10:31PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could visualize it as a sort of Sherlock Holmes-ian process of deduction:<br/><br/>Deduce all possible, logical explanations for what you see around you, and whatever is *left*... that must be magic.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455002/#Comment_455002" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-10T23:10:58+00:00" title="July 10, 2016 11:10PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha, beautiful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455004/#Comment_455004" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-10T23:57:21+00:00" title="July 10, 2016 11:57PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess in particular the thing that I see as one of D&amp;D's failures of imagination is that it unerringly trains players to see fantastical events through exactly one particular mechanical lens - that "magic" is the casting of spells or the equivalent of doing so through magical items.  The only (modern) edition that deviated from this, 4th, is often criticized for this exact deviation from orthodoxy - for daring to support this exact flexibility in imagination.  Especially in Wizards-era D&amp;D, all things magical are magic spells and magic items.  Whereas Hercules, a big strong dude, picked up a river one time and threw it. Pecos Bill lassooed a tornado, and it's not because he or his lasso "knew magic".  Finn McCool could disguise himself as a baby so well that the mother coudn't tell it, and it wasn't a magic spell. I suppose I am more fomenting resistance to this rather obvious blunder on WOTC's part than giving good suggestions on how to live with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455005/#Comment_455005" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-11T00:19:57+00:00" title="July 11, 2016 12:19AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see it as a failure of imagination, so much as an imposition of a specific worldview. D&amp;D has a long history of being very specific about how magic and the supernatural work, all the way back to the [in]famous "Vancian" magic system of the first books. And given how mechanical D&amp;D is, it's hard to change this worldview without making changes to the rules. (For example, my circa-1980 high-school group tossed out Vancian magic and had spells be powered by a "mana" stat that refreshed every morning to your INT.)<br/><br/>What you're saying, really, is that D&amp;D isn't a good system for games with that sort of loose mythical / legendary feel \u2026 which is certainly true.

Different groups and players probably are more or less strict regarding this, but for our group the importance of spellcasting components comes up fairly often ("Can I cast this spell without being detected?"). I did make sure to buy a "component pouch" before casting any spells that required material components, although I'm sure no one would have batted an eye if I hadn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455065/#Comment_455065" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-12T22:16:18+00:00" title="July 12, 2016 10:16PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I think that defining Verbal and Somatic components is really key for addressing issues of "nullifying" a spellcaster.
