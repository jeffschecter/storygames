The simplest form is we roll off to decide who gets to say what happens, but that roll-off isn't based on character attributes, situational features, or anything else; it's just us as players winning the roll, or pulling the high card, or what have you. It can be problematic if you are trying for a game in which a player's choices are tightly bound to the character's situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323561/#Comment_323561" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T09:58:17+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  9:58AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What RPGs are not parlor narration? <br/><br/>What RPGs are?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323564/#Comment_323564" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T09:59:08+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  9:59AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2011 10:12AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It can also be just the hammer your nail needs. <br/><br/>John: <a href="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/games/xochitlcozamalotl/xochitlcozamalotl_1.3.doc" rel="nofollow">Here's a game I wrote that is pure parlor narration</a>.

I knew Mr. Shoe, my nemesis, would try to outbid me, so I decided to buy it then and deny him the pleasure!"<br/><br/>I thought it was short for Parlour Game After-The-Fact Narration.<br/><br/>Rolling dice or drawing a card to see who gets to say what happens, by my understanding, wouldn't be parlour narration, assuming you respected the fictional positioning.<br/><br/>So, what I thought Parlour Narration was isn't for me, because with this kind of play my inner gamer starts filtering out the fiction - I start thinking, "Well, it doesn't matter what I add to the story, the dice are going to determine whether I succeed or fail." <br/><br/>Games for me that come perilously close to my idea of Parlour Narration are the 4e Skill System (the character is rolling dice to succeed at some problem, but it doesn't usually matter whether you, the player are role-playing or narrating or what), the threat tokens from 3:16 (it doesn't matter if you go in guns blazing or narrate a stealthy, coordinated attack - you still move along the track), and the mission dice from Inspectres (ditto).<br/><br/>So am I wrong?

They are essentially "I get to say what the dice tell me" procedures, organized into specific scenes and what-to-roll rituals. Unfortunately, this is not an SIS-generating procedure, any more than putting on a funny hat and voice when playing Monopoly is role-playing. These games are entirely too structured in terms of what a character "is," imaginatively speaking, and more generally, what "can happen" during play. In contrast with fairly ritualized games like My Life with Master and Polaris, I think these are marked by a complete inability for characters actually to do stuff outside the immediate instructions of the rules, up to and including making crucial choices about relationships with other characters.</blockquote>\nSo, it looks like the term was meant to talk about a disconnect between mechanics and fiction, but one that cuts out free narration. Where the rules say what happens in the fiction so directly that there what is narrated by the players has no effect (as in the Monopoly aside) or cannot vary from what the mechanics strictly dictate.  It seems like fictional board games like Tales of the Arabian Nights would fall under this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323589/#Comment_323589" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T11:41:21+00:00" title="May  9, 2011 11:41AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2011 11:41AM by Emily_Care.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

But our understanding is that parlor narration is when the fiction is divorced from the mechanics--"You win narration rights! Tell us what happens! And make it cool!"--is challenged by the thread that Matthijs cites, in which Ron says:\n<blockquote><cite><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=17351." rel="nofollow">Posted By: Ron Edwards</a></cite><br/>The most overtly Parlor Narration feature in the game, as I see it, is how it's determined who is going to have a beef about a given dead character. You just check your numbers and see whether you're pissed or not? And even worse, you check your numbers to see whether you back down or not, against opposition? I dunno, man. That's like being handed a script and told, "act like this." Not what I role-play for. What do you think about repairing this?</blockquote>\nYou have to look closely to see that it's the same idea: the fictional situation and the game mechanics aren't really connected. "Having a beef" and "backing down" are game-mechanical states, not fictional truths. The players may add narrative color, but that narrative color doesn't feed back into the mechanics, just like me winning narration rights by drawing the Ace of Spades this round doesn't have any implications for who can win narration rights next round nor on what they can say.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Rolling dice or drawing a card to see who gets to say what happens, by my understanding, wouldn't be parlour narration, <b>assuming you respected the fictional positioning</b>.</blockquote>\nThe assumption there is critical, I think. I want to call pure assigning-of-narration-rights without in-game reference "parlor narration" because of how it simply layers narration on top of the game mechanics without feeding back into them. This is Vincent's boxes and clouds and arrows, I think.\n<blockquote>So, what I thought Parlour Narration was isn't for me, because with this kind of play my inner gamer starts filtering out the fiction - I start thinking, "Well, it doesn't matter what I add to the story, the dice are going to determine whether I succeed or fail."<br/><br/>Games for me that come perilously close to my idea of Parlour Narration are the 4e Skill System (the character is rolling dice to succeed at some problem, but it doesn't usually matter whether you, the player are role-playing or narrating or what), the threat tokens from 3:16 (it doesn't matter if you go in guns blazing or narrate a stealthy, coordinated attack - you still move along the track), and the mission dice from Inspectres (ditto).</blockquote>\nYes! I've had that feeling about the 4e skill challenge system as written as well.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>It's a pejorative term for a style of play that's given me some of my best play experiences.</blockquote>\nSure, it's pejorative. But I'd argue that freeform games like Catherine aren't parlor narration, which implies that <i>playing it out</i> doesn't matter, and in the case of your game, playing it out is <i>all that matters</i>. The game mechanics, such as they are--draw a card and play it out--are <i>tightly connected</i> to the fiction, which is the opposite of parlor narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323594/#Comment_323594" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T12:23:56+00:00" title="May  9, 2011 12:23PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Bill:</b> Nice deciphering! Part of what this shows, I think, is that disconnects between narration and mechanics can happen in a number of different ways, but often with a tendency for the player to feel like what they say or do doesn't really matter, that it's "merely color" tacked on top of whatever the actual mechanics are.

That definitely happens too and also can suck.<br/><br/>I would suggest that this is also related to the problem that this crowd of indie folks often have with Wushu and other games where your effectiveness is limited by your ability to describe advantages.  You can always describe 3 advantages, right? So it feels meaningless and sometimes gets hand-waved away or just half-assed. Occasionally, fights in Mist-Robed Gate can descend into this too, if players aren't careful or the back and forth of competitive description stops feeling grounded in something real. Interestingly, danger dice in Danger Patrol operate in a similar ways, but the act of description doesn't usually feel fake and meaningless like it can in Wushu, even if I introduce "void sharks," which is fascinating to me.  I haven't quite figured out why that is yet, but I think it has something to do with the potential negative consequences of danger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323606/#Comment_323606" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T13:36:35+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  1:36PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Freeform takes that dependency on group coherence and chops out the influence of mechanical incentives.

So the inert or parlor fiction here would be what lead up to this moment. Then, since the outcome will be decided by someone regardless of the in-game material that makes what came before not pertinent? It seems as though that may be the case, or not, depending.

Take, for example, Once Upon a Time, which seems like a great idea for a game but I've always had it be unsatisfying in practice. The problem in OUAT is that the fiction -- and maintaining a quality or interesting narrative -- isn't really the point of the game. The point of the game is to win by getting rid of all of your cards and the fiction creation is only incidental to that (or has become so in most of the games I've played).  Even if you do your best to connect your narration to what previous players have done, you still often get a contrived, unsatisfying story driven by the desire to play all your cards and win, even in situations where playing your cards will introduce elements that make the story objectively worse or overly complicated or contrived.<br/><br/>EDIT (crossposted with Todd): Yeah, I would argue that OUAT and Wushu are related, in that they require you to narrate certain things in order to win, but don't care what those things are. That really hits this problem right on the head. It's very much "Say something, but what you say doesn't really matter!"<br/><br/>An additional problem can be introduced introduced by the open-ended nature of rights to "free narration," unrestricted by guidelines, intent, characters, traits, subject matter, or anything else.  Even if you are instructed to "make it work with what's come before," as you often are, that's more easily said than done, without any tools for you to track what's already been done and then build upon it. Definitely, there are many play styles, especially freeform styles, that simply rely on the players to keep all the important facts and fictional bits in their heads, ready to throw down and continue the story when called upon, but I would argue that -- in the best freeform play -- there is some degree of breaking up responsibilities, where players aren't responsible tracking, pacing, and figuring out ways to incorperate EVERYTHING, but rather just the things within their purview. Otherwise, players can be overwhelmed and choose their own points of interest or focus, creating a "too many cooks" phenomemon if people are interested in different things and there is not sufficient overlap to produce a core sense of "aboutness" (i.e. "what are we doing here? what is this game about?").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323620/#Comment_323620" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T14:55:24+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  2:55PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wushu is an interesting but perhaps misleading example. Playing with Clint Krause, he equated "tell me five cool things" with training wheels. When you play with experienced people, you just hand them five dice and assume they will build interesting narration every time. I think this "fixes" the common criticism, and effectively ties action to fiction - the procedure is, "when it is your turn to narrate, you get five extra dice".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323633/#Comment_323633" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T15:58:32+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  3:58PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Freeform takes that dependency on group coherence and chops out the influence of mechanical incentives.

But I was just talking about play where what you do isn't tied to mechanics that quantify and represent the fiction. Just talking, so you have to put into the fiction to help other folks believe in and see what you also did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323677/#Comment_323677" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T21:18:34+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  9:18PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read this as "parkour" narration - where you like, run fast and jump off stuff and tell a story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323679/#Comment_323679" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T21:38:06+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  9:38PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>I read this as "parkour" narration - where you like, run fast and jump off stuff and tell a story.</blockquote>\nHah!<br/><br/>That raises an interesting thing for me though. There are some things, like parkour, which look amazing on film, but when you put them in a game it's hard to make it more than just describing stuff for the sake of it.<br/><br/>It's hard to write a game where the system relies on you to to describe a bunch of cool parkour moves, and yet isn't also tedious and frustrating. Not impossible though! There are probably a bunch of other things like that.<br/><br/>I suspect that it's just one of the limits of the medium. Visually appealing things don't translate into speech very well - like hearing someone describe a ballet performance, or reading sheet music. The representation is not the thing itself, and loses something in translation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323698/#Comment_323698" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T23:34:26+00:00" title="May  9, 2011 11:34PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I reckon its like Chinese whispers.  I describe something that is vivid in my imagination, you interpret that into something more or less vivid in your imagination.  More vivid if I have been descriptive enough to engage your imagination (to fill in the blanks that the spoken description doesn't mention), less so if my description leaves you 'meh, whatever' and you aren't interested enough to engage with what I'm saying.<br/><br/>Its like when you read a book.  You and the author will have different versions of what the author is describing.  When an author is described as having 'vivid' prose, I don't think its necessarily that their words are especially effective at 'description'.  They are probably just effective at drawing attention, then your own imagination kicks in to provide the vividness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
