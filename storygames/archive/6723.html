From mainstream? Indy games? Computer Games?<br/>Images - one thing I love to see from players is an image to represent their character. Do you have suggestions or websites for image builders and/or photo/illustration sites to use?<br/>Name and background online "generators" can often be helpful.

To keep the drawings boring, the players will have to add detail...<br/><br/>Also, I like to request at no more than, no less than 3 descriptors that a stranger would notice about a character after a minute of interacting with him <i>(I think I stole this one from someone here but can't remember who it was)</i>. These can be physical traits, mannerisms, or props. For instance, one of my wife's characters was "tall, willowy, with a big ol' mole on her face."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149281/#Comment_149281" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T09:47:34+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  9:47AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brennen Reece</cite><i>(I think I stole this one from someone here but can't remember who it was)</i>.</blockquote>\nJared's Rule of Three.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149351/#Comment_149351" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T12:21:43+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 12:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite><cite>Posted By: Brennen Reece</cite><i>(I think I stole this one from someone here but can't remember who it was)</i>.</blockquote>\nJared's Rule of Three.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

It's an easy way for new and old players alike to better visualize their character, their attitudes, looks, and dress in many cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oni<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.thirdeyegames.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdeyegames.net</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
