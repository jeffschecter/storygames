Its greatest structural successes are those of Stafford's Pendragon: a superbly compact yet never sketchy adventure format, seamless hard-wiring of characters into setting and continuity, and unprecedented emphasis on epic, generational storytelling. Thematically, it is a triumph of Arthurian art , the roleplaying form's equivalent of Tennyson's The Idylls of the King or Wagner's Parsifal\xe2\u20ac\u201da brilliant personal engagement with one of the foundation myths of Western fantasy.<br/><br/>Greg Stafford has worked in the hobby-games industry since 1975, when he founded the publishing company Chaosium. His seminal game RuneQuest was released in 1978, and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential and inspirational designers in the history of the RPG field.<br/><br/>Also shortlisted for the Diana Jones Award this year were the pirate-based coin game Pieces of Eight designed by Jeff Tidball and published by Atlas Games; and Stefan Pokorny, the creator, sculptor and painter of the Master Maze line of miniature terrain from Dwarven Forge.<br/><br/>The Diana Jones Award is given annually to whatever in the opinion of its mostly-anonymous committee shows or exemplifies gaming at its best. Anyone and anything within the games industry and hobby is eligible to win the Diana Jones Award, including individuals, products, publications, publishers, distributors, retailers, clubs, organisations, conventions, events, trends, innovations and concepts. Previous winners include Peter Adkison and Jordan Weisman, the RPGs Nobilis, Sorcerer and My Life with Master, and the boardgame Ticket to Ride.<br/><br/>For more information please contact James Wallis: <a href="james@erstwhile.demon.co.uk" rel="nofollow">james@erstwhile.demon.co.uk</a><br/>Contact the Diana Jones Award committee: <a href="committee@dianajonesaward.org" rel="nofollow">committee@dianajonesaward.org</a><br/>More information on the award: <a href="http://www.dianajonesaward.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.dianajonesaward.org</a></i><br/>__________________                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88735/#Comment_88735" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-18T13:44:00+00:00" title="August 18, 2007  1:44PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so now I have to look at this thing, because everything I have heard about it makes it seems like Everything Josh Hates About Roleplaying, Only Bigger.

I prefer my RPGs creative, collaborative, and to allow you to do something at your table that's fundamentally different than what other people are doing at their table.

It can be, but it's not necessarily so. <br/><br/>I tend to see the grand historical events as akin to something like WWII, does that mean playing any game with a grand backdrop of WWII is a waste of time? Say a campaign based around Band of Brothers? Those characters make personal, dramatic and consequential decisions all the time even though they aren't major generals, or the Prime Ministers on the global stage.<br/><br/>It's the same with the Pendragon Campaign, we're running it now and we've dealt with loads of stuff on loads of different levels. We're effectively the leaders of Salisbury at the moment, and the campaign is set-up for that, it's not just something we've done, expanding the lands, deciding which Saxons to betray, which ones not so. Leading expeditionary forces to expand our lands. Throw in a load of personal stuff about family, fueds, issues of religion, aging and death and it's deep stuff.<br/><br/>I had trouble with it in the beginning for the reasons you mention, I was wrong. This doesn't mean it still won't be problematic for you, but I'm just saying what you're saying doesn't seem to be as true in AP as far as I can see.<br/><br/>More info here: <a href="http://www.fandomlife.net/fln/blogs.cfm?kwd=4" rel="nofollow">The Campaign</a><br/><br/>Keep in mind I like all sorts of games, but I have a particular dislike for heavy setting, simulative type games - this ain't it.

I'd like to give it the benefit of the doubt, but it just sounds sorta railroady. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's hard to explain, so bear with me. For lack of a better term, the "Chaosium" model is to publish a plot in it's entirity, and then expect the GM to cope with the fact that it's a plot. Meaning that you have two options with a pre-set plot:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Railroad the players through the plot. Oh, sure, the players can do dialog with Arthur as he passes through. But if Arthur is going to fight with Lancelot over Guenevre at some point, then the PCs can't be allowed to seduce her. Right? Because that would mess up all of that stuff in the book after that fact. So this makes it feel as though the role of the players is just to be there to view the events as they unfold, and have no real effect upon them. All Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Allow players to affect the plotline, but then have to "wing it" in terms of modifying the ongoing plot, again, making much of what's in the book pointless. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, interestingly, I think Josh, and certainly myself, don't mind "winging it." But then how is the book helping? Rather, how are the events listed pertinent? Why not just have a sourcebook of the characters and their motives?  And even possible events. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the problem with something like this is in jarring presentation. The text for many products like this is written instructing the GM on what "should" happen next. If those things are just suggestions, then they could do with a much better presentation. Further, the idea that Ian has - that' it's like WWII - is a fine idea. As backdrop (see Ron Edwards' notes on "Underbelly play"). But usually the characters are presented as more than backdrop in such products. Tempting you to allow the players to kill them or whatnot. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre the PCs supposed to interact with Arthur or not? Do they merely hear about his exploits, or do they get involved? If the book has no notes on this, what does it imply? Rather, given the presentation of the data, what's enabled by the data? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I think that I at least, and perhaps others, are leaping to some conclusions here. Perhaps Greg has come up with a way to present this information in such a way as to make it all really useful in play, not at all jarring, just suggestions for what might happen, no events that are predicated on long chains of previous events, etc, etc. Or something even more brilliant than this. Greg's certainly capable of such innovation, I think. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we should hold off until we understand the product better. A problem with this, however, is that the size of the product is such that, barring understanding it well, and having misgivings about it, lots of us here are unlikely to purchase the book to get a closer view. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that said, if anybody actually has purchased the thing, or better yet, has played through some of it, I'd love to hear about it from them in terms of these things. Is it just a character sourcebook with some notions for potential events to occur over time to create events for players to respond to? Or is it yet another script that has to be deconstructed to be of any use to a GM who wants to empower their players to create real change in the plots in which their characters are embroiled? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20O%27Rourke" title="Ian O'Rourke"><img alt="Ian O'Rourke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20O%27Rourke">Ian O'Rourke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88868/#Comment_88868" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T07:13:09+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  7:13AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2007 7:26AM by Ian O'Rourke.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem I have is I'm experiencing it totally from the view point of the player, so I can't overly comment on the product itself. This makes responding to your specific points difficult, as to how it's presented and structured in the book. Vodkashok may have a better idea when he returns from GenCon (he's not the GM, but I think he's more familiar with the layout, content, etc).<br/><br/>As a player I can say, as the years have gone by:<br/><br/>- We've had the daughters of the King of the Forest Suavage as our wives and this has caused all sorts of trouble.<br/>- We've fought a blood fued with the black bear clan, a section of the Saxons on behalf of one of our knight cohort - resulting in an epic battle with them and fairy creatures on our side due to pulling on favours with said Wives' father.<br/>- We effectively run Salisbury on behalf of the wife of the dead Lord (all of them effectively die leaving the players as the next rung in charge), on this basis we make the decisions on how it is run, we advice on who the widow should marry, how her son should be raised, decide who to make war on and who to make peace with.<br/> - One character has slept with a young Morgan, and I believe she is pregnant with his child.<br/> - We've helped merlin retreive the Excalibur, we helped Merlin steal Author, though we were duped into that one.<br/> - We made war on the Duke of Cornwall and delivered the killing blows, this battle had a big effect as it was one in which we gained much renown, but little honor - a true sign of the might is right period we are in.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, with a load of personal narratives and stuff. The main thing is, this all fits in to the overall framework I believe, and I'll have to ask the GM, but I don't think it's been an issue in a 'I might as well not have this book anymore, sort of way. We run our lands, we run the country, we have our own personal issues and conflicts, we occassionally bumpt into history, etc.<br/><br/>It would be interesting to see how it is structured and pitched in the book, and how that relates to how the campaign is being run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88871/#Comment_88871" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T07:43:28+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  7:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me a matter of perspective.  I don't think the players are intended to be on the same level as Arthur and his peers.  Arthur and his story is a force moving through the game that cannot be resisted any more than you could change the rotation of the earth.  I think the role of the player is tell his own story in the spaces between the great threads--and it seems to me that there is plenty of room in there.<br/><br/>If you were playing another game where you were a priest who had an actual relationship with God, would you be upset if you couldn't change God's mind or influence his actions?  Knowing that you can't change God's mind, couldn't you make the game about the things you did have the power to influence?<br/><br/>I have the GPC, but I've not played it or looked at it thoroughly yet.  I may be wrong about it and find it stifling, but the idea of weaving a story through the story of Arthur seems really appealing to me.  I've seen the idea work in other places.  I played in a Serenity con game where the players were a crew hired to help Simon break out River.  The GM let us know that we could take the story off of the rails, but we decided to stick to the canon and play in the white space of the margins and it was a very, very fun game.  Now when I watch the movie, I almost feel like I was a part of it because of that experience. <br/><br/>I really like Droog's notion that you are collaborating with other people: they're just not at your table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88872/#Comment_88872" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T07:49:55+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  7:49AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2007 7:50AM by JDCorley.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to talk (seriously this time) about the question Ian didn't. Specifically:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Are the PCs supposed to interact with Arthur or not? Do they merely hear about his exploits, or do they get involved? If the book has no notes on this, what does it imply? Rather, given the presentation of the data, what's enabled by the data?</blockquote>\nReally, the "Chaosium method" of presenting a fully realized plot, is no different from a dungeon crawl module with a full description of every room. The players' decisions determine what parts of it they see next. Is there some expectation that the players will enter every room or interact with every part of the plot? No, certainly not, and this is extremely obvious.  In fact, the worse-designed Call of Cthulhu scenarios clunk and shudder and clunk to a halt if players either refuse to go through a chokepoint or, worse, fail a roll that would lead them to one.<br/><br/>What the data enable is a highly detailed version of certain events and people when they occur or enter the game. The "they have stats so we can kill them" meme was tired in 1992 and dead shortly thereafter. AD&amp;D put a stake in its heart with modules that you simply closed and put away if the PCs killed everyone they came across. Killing everyone with stats was game sabotage just as much as refusing to go into the dungeon. Call of Cthulhu similarly statted out allies, contacts, and so on, so that is especially no longer an issue with "the Chaosium method".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Or is it yet another script that has to be deconstructed to be of any use to a GM who wants to empower their players to create real change in the plots in which their characters are embroiled?</blockquote>\nThis is the real meat right here. If you don't believe, as I do, that you murder every author's idea no matter how faithful you try to be to it, it might be a matter of some importance how closely you adhere to the plot ("script" only really applies to a few avante-garde White Wolf modules from the 90s. By avante-garde, I mean shitty.) You may feel like your collaboration is fighting the plot, or ruining it, or going off the map, and that this is somehow "not supported."  I consider that feeling loopy (of course nobody asked me!)  At-table collaboration will always beat the designer, no matter how general the designer is, no matter how vague or "suggestion"-y the presentation is, and the collaboration will always be doing something that would make the designer stare in horrified disbelief.<br/><br/>The super-detailed plot book is really not that different from the super-detailed setting book in that regard. Both can only be sensibly used as highly detailed targets for literary explosives planted by GMs and players. When you destroy them, the explosions are much more shrapnel-filled. (Liking or disliking shrapnel is a matter of taste, of course.)  To say this is using them incorrectly is to assume that the only way to properly use them is to be an idiot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88883/#Comment_88883" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T08:59:31+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  8:59AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2007 9:02AM by Brand_Robins.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's a thing, there is no one story of Arthuriana. Like, even Mallory doesn't tell one single sustained narrative. There are all these things that happen, that as a whole develop into something greater than the sum of the parts in La Morte. In the rest of the corpus as a whole its really very fragmented, moving across about 1200 years, 3ish continents, and a dozen languages. <br/><br/>Do characters in Arthuriana interact with Arthur? Well, sometimes. Other times he's really just a figure in the background, and the focus of the story is upon the knight (usually a knight) and the adventures they have through the magical realms of Romance. Owain goes and saves a lion, fights a black knight, marries a lady, proves he's a worthy husband, finally defeats the black knight, and returns married to Camelot to be titled "The Knight of the Lion."  Tristan and Isolde are sometimes part of the Arthur corpus, and sometimes not, so sometimes they interact with Arthur, but mostly they interact with Mark -- their liege lord. Gawain gets heavily involved in the fall of Camelot, with Lancelot and the love affair and all that, but most of the time he's actually haring off about the country and the majority of his adventures involve fighting giants, fucking damsels, and being a generally human guying trying really hard (and sometimes succeeding) at being a good knight. <br/><br/>Pendragon campaigns tend to follow a similar pattern. There is usually an initial period where the characters will interact with a couple of "names" from the early show -- a little Uther here and there, a little bit of Badon Hill where the PCs may die or may shift the course of the battle a little. Then after that there is a long period where the PCs are doing their own shit in their own world. Arthur is over there, and he's awesome and so say all of us, but the things the PCs are doing are like the adventures that Gawain and Owain and all the other **ains have. They romp about going to tournaments, fighting giants, getting screwed, or screwed over by faerie, and generally proving what kind of fellows they are by repeatedly being brought up against their traits and passions. Over time you get to know them in the manner you get to know most of the knights of Arthuriana -- by watching how they deal with situations over time. You then get to know their children, and watch the whole thing go generational as the first sets of characters die off, get old, retire or go to Camelot to be big shots and generally slip out of the game. <br/><br/>By the time you get towards the end of the campaign, the second and third generation PCs are usually pretty bad ass. They then get involved with the last glory of Camelot, and in my experience at this stage do get directly involved with a lot of the "names" -- even more so than at the start of the game. Its also in this part of the game that the PCs influence can become telling upon what happens. The way the game tends to be set, its unlikely that the PCs will change the major events of the world -- Guinevere is still probably going to get caught in adultery, the war is still going to happen, Arthur is going to bite it. <br/><br/>Now, I have seen games in which the players have managed to change some of these things. (Camelot always falls, but the details differ.) But even in the games where they don't, because of the structure of the game where the characters have long been involved in their own quests and their own lives, coming back to the "names" feels less like a "you will now watch their story" and more like a "oh shit, the whole world is falling apart, how does it effect me and my family, the generations of people we've watched for the past two years of play." It often happens in play that the characters manor being razed by Jutes is a more central moment of play than the Wicked Day. <br/><br/>There is railroad and "watch the big story" potential in Pendragon. (Then, there often is in many sim games from pre-generated source material.) However, it mostly only happens when the group wants to watch the Big Named Knights do their thing. If they don't, if they want to tell the stories of their own knights, then they will. And suggesting that they cannot because they can't change Arthur's story is really odd to me. First, sometimes they can. Second, is carry railroaded if the players can't bring peace between American and the VietCong and make Vietnam the 51st state? So long as the world is the world and the characters story is the story, having the big names in the background is just setting, not plot. <br/><br/>Now, as for the GPC itself, it does have moments where you can see rails. However, in the context of the kind of play that  lot of people like, they are perfectly fitting rails. (And, as JD says, if you don't like them then blowing them up will be fun.) But the vast majority of the book is not "and then you watch Arthur say to Gawain, "Did you fight a green knight?"" The majority of the book is "so Arthur is a good king, and Camelot is really nice, now in your lands the faerie knight has kidnapped the woman you love, even though she may not have loved you and may have actually gone with him willingly, so are you going to go and save her from a life of wonder and ease in faerie, or are you going to crush the Saxon peasants who keep raiding your crops, oh, and what about your uncle who wants you to introduce your good-for-nothing cousin to the Bishop in order to get him a cushy job on the curia....?" <br/><br/>Really, its a giant book full of situations, color, potential quests, lots of NPCs, and a huge amount of potential for players to make meaningful choices in the lives and stories of their characters. It doesn't do it by letting them retell Arthur's story, so much, it lets it do it by them telling the story of their knights in the rise and fall of the background. <br/><br/>And yea, it certainly isn't for everyone. But there is a huge space between "this is railroaded" and "this is a totally protagonist driven narrative in which everything in the world is instantly responsive to the PCs", and talking about it like a simple binary isn't going to do this book justice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88884/#Comment_88884" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T09:06:22+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  9:06AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2007 9:10AM by Moreno R..">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that having a prewritten plot is VERY different from having a dungeon description. <br/><br/>It's the difference between "that house is red" and "you have to go to that house and knock on the door, or the adventure is finished!!"<br/><br/>Said this, I see a big difference between a railroaded "adventure" and The Big Campaign, too. The difference is that everybody ALREADY KNOW at least the bigger points of the plot.<br/><br/>So, you don't need to railroad the players to avoid them killing Arthur and taking excalibur. They already know that they shouldn't. They wanted to play that game to play in Arthur's legends, so they would not want to ruin that. This way,the big, pre-written legend become a limitation of the game premise (like the fact that you can't attack the master at the beginning of MLWM), and there's no need of a railroad.  (it's still a very simulative way of playing, to "recreate" an already-know story, finding a niche for your characters in the sidelines, so it will not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's not railroading)<br/><br/>[edit: cross-posted with Brand]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88885/#Comment_88885" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T09:06:48+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  9:06AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2007 9:19AM by Brand_Robins.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, all of the above post said, and with my declaration that this book is pretty awesome and doing what it does -- even if we don't all like what that thing is -- I do have to wonder if part of this award is partly about Gaming Legend Greg Stafford getting his props. <br/><br/>I mean, the book is awesome, yes.

I'm not sure of the context of the quote, but I can attest to the game needing a bit of a shift in thinking - this is especially true in the pre-arthur parts of the game. In this period might is right, and that might is rolled out at the behest and whims of very passionate ment. The glory system also supports this. As a result, you end up taking actions for glory, that in modern thinking, aren't that great, or that honourable, but you become a 'better Knight' because of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88918/#Comment_88918" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T12:20:10+00:00" title="August 20, 2007 12:20PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to point out quickly --<i> that's not the quote</i>.

The major one reads: \n<blockquote>I early decided that I would narrow the focus of this game to be only about knights. I would not try to mimic the popular conception of fantasy that threw every possible player type into a big messy pool of options. I wanted to stick to the standards of literature, which didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t cater to commoners, thieves, scribes, or even magicians. Later, under pressure from Game Masters who wanted a portrayal of Arthurian magic, I did publish a magic system for the game, which naturally led to addressing the issue for player characters who wanted to be magicians. But I always considered that a dilution of the essential game, and almost everyone who has commented says it is no fun to be a magic user in Pendragon. I have to admit, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fine by me.<br/><br/>By focusing on knights, I early realized that Glory acquisition would be the key to the game. It was a reasonable coin with which to measure the value of a knight\xe2\u20ac\u2122s life, both in the literary and the real worlds. So I made a list of things that knights do, and began fiddling with the relative values. With that \xe2\u20ac\u0153game coin\xe2\u20ac\x9d as the focus, I began working out how characters would collect it.<br/><br/>But if the game was all about knights, then I needed to differentiate them. I needed to quantify behavior, because I wanted it to be able to include patterns of conduct as different as William Marshall and Gille de Rais. Play testing resolved the system. So everyone would be a knight, and the game is about what kind of knight you are going to be.<br/><br/>This decision led to a proliferation of knightly types. That is, everyone would have to be a fighting type, since that is the job of all knights. But chivalric behavior, romantic manners, and religious leanings were different. I eventually included character generation for people from every nation that produced original Arthurian stories and different religions as well (not in this fifth-edition rulebook, but to be published later).<br/><br/>So I early had the literary structure and idealistic frame for the game. But that alone is not enough. I love the setting of medieval reality and its brutal, gritty realism of the struggle between life and death. Though many games are tilted toward player character ease, making a knight\xe2\u20ac\u2122s work easy dilutes the emotional impact of play. I wanted players to feel as worried about their characters as characters would be about themselves. Since the perfection of Arthurian ideals is offset by this danger, I wanted to make a game that walked the line between the brutalities of a lethal reality and the idealism of a visionary life dedicated to the highest standards of human life. This theme is the key to the Arthurian legends.<br/><br/>So the game is dangerous and lethal (for the characters). I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want to water down the knight\xe2\u20ac\u2122s life of death and danger. I wanted players to know the danger, to have a reason for their knights to strategically retreat once in a while. The sweetness and light of so many previous fantasy games, which were either not lethal or had a hundred methods of resurrection and healing, is alien to the body of Arthurian lore. The original stories were entertainment for men who knew the realities of combat, and I felt that to water that down betrayed the body of literature.<br/><br/>So, every character is going to die, either from violence or old age.<br/><br/>But these people also lived in a world of ideals and hope that offered to lift them from the filth and dirt in which their lives were mired. Much of this hope came from spiritual ideals, an unreachable goal. Yet, these ideas of chivalry and noblesse oblige\xe2\u20ac\u201dand of romance and love\xe2\u20ac\u201dwere real, and some people strove to obtain them. The legends of idealized knights striving for the unobtainable ideals would not have been so popular had they not moved those tough, grizzled killers of men, and that makes them critical to the game. I wanted it to mirror the concerns of that period. I did not want the simple, shallow reality of killing things without repercussions, without a concern for the larger world in which people live.<br/><br/>So that essential tension in Arthurian literature\xe2\u20ac\u201dideals versus reality\xe2\u20ac\u201dhad to be the basis for the game.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88923/#Comment_88923" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T12:40:42+00:00" title="August 20, 2007 12:40PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2007 12:41PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Brand,<br/><br/>No, that's not it.

I don't mind taking it to another thread, or offline, whichever you like, but if I sounds like a broken record, it's because the issue comes up again and again and again in all sorts of contexts.  Somewhere between the Big Campaign Book and our eyes, some sort of radiation alters what you see (or what I see) so that you see a finished, set, burdensome product that does not "empower the players to create real change" and I see raw, unfinished, provocative material whose only sensible, indeed, almost the only <i>conceivable</i> use is to do exactly that.  <br/><br/>I did not call you or anyone else an idiot. (And I don't think you are one.)  Restating the point just to make it clear: If I use a Big Detailed Campaign Book or a Big Detailed Setting Book or, you know, History, in a game by pulling a piece here and a piece there and an NPC here and an event there, and a plot here, and a clue there, and putting them all together in a tremendous mishmash, I am not using them incorrectly. And if I do this only a tiny bit, the process I undertake is not greatly different from if I change everything I can think of.<br/><br/>Defining "correct" usage of a book in any way that excludes my use of the material would lead to the inescapable conclusion that only idiots who were intentionally fucking up their game could ever use a book "correctly." Since this is absurd (you do agree this is absurd, I hope?), we have to allow that I am using the material in the manner it is fit to be used.<br/><br/>I do not think you consciously have the view that I am using the book incorrectly, but how else am I to interpret your presentation of "two options with a pre-set plot"?  The only conceivable response which will enrich God and mankind, and you and I, is "no, that's wrong, there are many other options, here is one."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89021/#Comment_89021" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T20:44:19+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  8:44PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Out of curiosity, how would you compare your take on<i>The Great Pendragon Campaign</i>with the metaplot for Tribe 8. (I picked up <i>Tribe 8</i>, loved the setting, but never got the metaplot books or had a chance to play.)</blockquote>\nI like to refer to <em>Tribe 8</em> as a great failed experiment.  To my mind, it gave us a lot of very valuable negative data.  It showed us how <em>not</em> to structure and market a game; it showed us the vicious drawbacks of a canon metaplot; it showed us how much players will deviate from any author's expectation of player behavior.<br/><br/>I even think Greg snagged a part of the lesson: <em>Tribe 8</em> showed, pretty definitively, that a metaplot released over multiple supplements can't be sustained very long.  I would not be surprised to find that that lesson is one of many reasons that <em>The Great Pendragon Campaign</em> is in one volume.  <em>Tribe 8</em> also tried to make the PCs the big guns of the setting, at least at some points during the metaplot.  Having the PCs doing their own thing in the background -- as lots of folks have suggested <em>TGPC</em> does -- is an adequate sidestep.<br/><br/>For me personally, though, it comes down to a disconnect in my shopping habits.  If I pick up a game about King Arthur, I don't want to play "in the legend of King Arthur;" I want to <em>play King Arthur</em>.  I can almost see "play the Knights of Arthur"... but if that was the point of the game, the game should be called <em>Knights of the Pendragon</em>, not <em>Pendragon</em>.

Let me preface by saying that I do consider the Great Pendragon Campaign a nice supplement, but - after having read it - I share Mike's concerns. It is stocked full of stuff and works great as a historical piece to outline this particular telling of the Arthurian myth. However, as a gaming product, for me, it is more a reference book.<br/><br/>Basically, what you have in the book is a "historical" telling with gaming notes and lots'n'lots of adventure hooks. If I were content to run a game which is meta-plot heavy, with the players being forwarded through a series of events, with the intervals filled with them picking up on various adventure hooks which the book the offers, I'd be all set.<br/><br/>The problem is I don't personally need generic plot hooks, I need specific plot hooks (more bangs, less trail of bread crumbs). I don't want historical events in which my players can simply participate, I want events in which they can take an active hand in. To do this, I need to pour through the book, looking for a suitable premise, situation and location for the players to hook to. To this end, to make my game happen, in essence I need to do a deconstruction of the book.<br/><br/>If you and your players are just content to play a game of adventuring knights who go on various adventures which are sometimes loosely and perhaps sometimes not at all linked to each other, with the backdrop of the Arthurian myth occurring as you go, the characters occasionally being there when Arthur defeats the rebel kings or at Badon, you will not have a lot of trouble and the book will deliver all of its implicit promises.<br/><br/>All that said, I still think it's a useful book. Indeed, I'd go on melodramatically to say it's the last great work of an age when we thought the traditional scenario model could work. Actually, maybe it does work, but not if you want to play story games, as opposed to adventure games. For me, it's fundamentally flawed in that sense, but it's still a beauty.<br/><br/>Joachim Buchert                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89111/#Comment_89111" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T09:55:26+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  9:55AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the conclusion of this discussion about the book is that different groups have different Creative Agenda?  ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89136/#Comment_89136" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T11:02:52+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 11:02AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joachim, I am at a loss as to how this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jbuchert</cite>To do this, I need to pour through the book, looking for a suitable premise, situation and location for the players to hook to.

Especially since I came on, as a member of that group of folks who have reservations about this sort of supplement, to say that we should reserve judgment on it. I'm saying to Josh that we probably don't know enough about it to damn it, even as just the sort of thing that we find problematic. So, you see, it's really quite off-topic from the POV that you can't really be talking about the product in question, you have to only be talking in the abstract about the sort of objection in question. Moreover, from the one person in the thread who seems to have some practical experience with the product(though I'm not sure if that's practical experience with the supplement itself, or with the notion of playing this way), it looks to as though the product may well, in fact, not be the sort of supplement we have problems with. <br/>\n<br/>\nHence why I wanted to start a new thread, and probably should have. It looks to all the evidence at the moment, that our misgivings about it are misplaced. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut now I am called out to explain our position in general. So here goes. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my use of the word "deconstruction" seems to imply looking at author intent, that's my fault for bad communication. But the words in the text have meanings, often as instructions. It is not only certain White Wolf publications that are subject to this problem. The example that I often cite (I'm pretty sure I've cited it to you), is the 400+ page "adventure" from Chaosium known as "At The Mountains of Madness." Now you might think that it would be impossible for such a tome not to be a sourcebook, that it couldn't be possible to have that much material presented as a "script," as I've put it, but I assure you that the term is apt. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I use that term? Because the book, throughout the text reads like a script. I don't have my copy on hand at the moment (I bought it for the sheer enormity of the artifact), but I recall it having passeges that read like the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n"After the monster comes and grabs the crewmembers, the PCs give chase." <br/>\n<br/>\nThe book literally tells you what it is that the PCs are to do in each scene. Literally. There are other scenes in which the information is presented in terms of a conflict that you are supposed to have occur as GM. Despite the fact that there are usually many other plausible sorts of conflicts that could come out of the action. For instance, there's a moment when the plane in the hold gets destroyed by fire, and all the PCs can do is to put it out and save the ship. The book makes it clear that this has to happen. It's important, because it makes many of the subsequent scenes occur they way they're written - if the plane is intact, then those scenes might get skipped, or occur other than the text delivers them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe authors could have just not have had a plane - but then it wouldn't have been like the actual expeditions... so they had to include one, but had to destroy it, so that the plot could advance as proposed... oy, my head hurts....<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another scene there is a sidebar on how to ensure that the exact outcome of the scene happens, by using classic magician's force techniques (If you chose my left hand, I open it - if you chose my right hand, I drop it, and open my left). <br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on. It's a script. Moreover, there's nothing wrong with a script, if that's what you want. Neither Josh nor I have said that one has to be stupid to like the implied sort of play. Just that we don't like it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, does that make it entirely useless for myself and/or Josh? Am I so unintelligent that I couldn't use the materials therin to run the game as I'd prefer? No, there's a process by which one can sift out ideas for play from the scripting terms. I can change "...they run off after the monster" to, "If they run off after the monster." <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I meant by "deconstruction." I should have said "mental alteration." <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two problems with this:<br/>\n1. It leaves rather little of use in the book. Especially once play gets going, and the players go their own way, and suddenly the last 380 pages of the book become mostly irrellevant. I can still try to use the ideas in the rest of the book, but there's less and less chance that the ideas will be usable with little change. It becomes more and more work to use the book as a tool. Which is bad because...<br/>\n2. I'm lazy. I'd rather have the book give me the data and ideas presented in a way that's easy for me to use without alteration. And, yes, such sourcebooks do exist. It may well be that The Great Pendragon Campaign is one of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo why are we apprehensive about TGPC possibly being the sort of supplement presentation we don't like? Well, having seen Stafford's stuff in the past, I know he sometimes writes scripts. For instance, for HQ, there's an adventure about a heroquest that involves raising the dragonship (IIRC?). The adventure is written as a series of things that the PCs basically get to be there to see, "participating" by being just some of the very many other mass worshippers who are present for the proceeding. Moreover, I'm guessing that TGPC has a timeline. This, in and of itself, is not automatically damning. But it's typical of the sorts of supplements that tend to be written as scripts. X must happen, so that Y may happen in a cool way later. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, and Josh can correct me where I'm wrong here, he may feel particularly against this sort of supplement because of his history. Some of which he's eluded to above, but to be more explicit, he was part of a team that wrote one of the worst offenders of this sort of all time. The Tribe 8 metaplot had the following "flaws" from the POV of a player like myself, and, apparently, Josh:<br/>\n1. It is, like the Stafford adventure I mention, chock full of events that are written such that the players are not mentioned as actually interacting with the events, but where they are just present to observe them. The text is written to enable the GM to tell a story to the players. Including such famous events as the PCs arriving at a temple where "somebody important" (Joshua?) goes inside, and fights a fight that THE PCS ARE WRITTEN AS NOT SEEING, and he comes out, and play proceeds on to the next greate event. <br/>\n2. Worse, this plot was revealed in chunks in book after book. If you were interested in playing the events of the books that were to come at all, it behooved you to railroad the plot through the previous books so that you could be sure to be at the right starting point for the next. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure if Josh feels guilty, or just abused, as I'm not sure how complicit he was in all of this. Oh, and Brand was involved as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear, these RPG supplements are no more useful as such to a player like myself or Josh than being handed a Shakespeare script, and being told that we're supposed to make play materials out of that. Again, that might work for some people, but there are, for players like Josh and I, objectively better ways for ideas to be presented that make them easier to use in play. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89183/#Comment_89183" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T12:46:27+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 12:46PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2007 12:52PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a far more general note about this sort of objection that you're firing off, whenever we claim that there's a better or worse way to present information, you always fire back that we're just being slavish to what we think is the author's intent. This is not the case (at least with anybody that I respect, including most people here), even if the language the poster uses might make you feel that way. What we're saying is that we want a hammer, but are being handed a screwdriver. Yeah, the intent doesn't matter, but the content does. The hammer is designed to drive nails, and while you can do it with a screwdriver, it simply doesn't work as well. Saying that we're just kow-towing to the designer of the screwdriver, and failing to use it well here, because we can't see how to use it as a hammer is missing the point. We can, and often do use the screwdrivers handed to us as hammers. We'd just prefer a hammer. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking it up one level more, I don't want to get into ad hominems. But it's a classic tactic, JD, to say:<br/>\n<br/>\n"Oh, I didn't say you are an idiot... I'm just saying that anyone who believes what you're saying is an idiot." <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, maybe I'm misreading you, but I'm going to get speculatively personal back at you. I think, sometinmes, that you're threatened when people around here criticize something you like, saying that they find something wrong with it. That's usually something traditional that you enjoy. I think that you associate, with us, an agenda promoted by intellectual dishonesty, designed to destroy the things that you have fun with. And your tactic is always to expose it as BS by pointing out that our arguments are based on some aetherial notion of the author's intent. Instead of valid criticisms of the actual content of the texts in question. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr do  I have you wrong? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, if I do, consider, just for a moment, that you might have us wrong, too. That we're not the intellectual cowards that, well, your arguments sure seem to make us out to be, to me (whether or not that's your intent). <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have anything to be defensive about. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don't, either, right? You like what you like to play, and isn't that the only worthwhile criteria? So if we say we hate something you don't like... that could just be preference differences... right? It doesn't have to mean that either of us is wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what Shreyas might say. He's just militant, you see. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a strong hope that this might put this to bed. But life isn't usually that simple.

(I make no apologies for 'thread drift'. Pixels are cheap, we can go elsewhere, or others can, or they can talk over and around us, and all is well. Of course as a mean old man from the days when rn was the way to discuss things with others on the Internet, I may not be up on all of the tea party pinky finger etiquette all the kids use these days...)<br/><br/>First of all, I don't see "next, a chase scene!" as a script.  At all. It's not even remotely akin to a script.  This is perhaps because of my theater and vaudeville-history background.  I see "next, a chase scene!" as the exact sort of restrictions that are necessary to make improv work.  Improv acting cannot function in a vacuum. There must always be restrictions on what can happen and what can be introduced.  Otherwise, it's "anything can happen, hurr!" and nothing ever does.  Whenever you read anything about improv, you will constantly find repeated instructions with respect to dealing with restrictions, establishing them, changing them, and so on.  I see "next, a chase scene!" as a boundary for fun improvisation.  Now, I can move that boundary back ("next, they have to find the monster, they can chase, or scout around, or try some investigation"), or I can close it in even tighter ("next, a chase scene, we begin with the characters rappelling into the darkness and suddenly the ice begins to groan and give way...") but I don't see it as somehow destructive of the work to do so, nor as any kind of undue "work". ("Work" in quotes because I don't really know that I agree with you that you are "lazy" by the normal definition, more on this later.)<br/><br/>Scripts are something that must be memorized and adhered to and - and this is very important - <i>recited back</i>.  Everyone on the stage knows the script.  Not everyone off the stage does.  That is not analogous to what you describe in the Mountains of Madness supplement (which I also own, so at least we are on the same page) or most Big Campaign Supplements. What those series...es... um... series of scenes and conditions are meant to do is to channel the game along, like restrictions in improv acting channel the scenes along.  <br/><br/>Now here is my caveat: Some White Wolf modules actually did indeed contain scripts, that is, dialogues that were supposed to be read by each participant and actions literally pre-scripted in, as in, you would reach a certain point in the script and people would roll for the outcome of actions!  (I haven't seen what you describe in what little Tribe 8 I own but I frankly have no damn clue whether the game I concoct from Tribe 8 is remotely like what anyone else has concocted because of the in-character-fiction style of presentation, the worst style of presentation ever conceived by the hand of man - that's my story and I'm stickin' to it...) Although now that I think about it, very early d6 Star Wars supplements also contained scripts, used primarily as scene framing - you would read the script and that would launch the adventure...hmm...maybe this is more common than I thought...connections to Polaris' key phrases, hmm hmmm....all right, sorry. Tangent to the tangent.<br/><br/>But semantics of what a "script" is aside, and aside from the other uses of scripts in games, how is it different for a player to hear "Now there's a chase scene!" from another player when they're reading it out of the book, or when, for example, someone says "It's a chase scene!" in PTA when it's their turn to establish an agenda, or when the GM in Dogs in the Vineyard says, "He runs!" and the player sitting next to them says, "I give chase!"  The experience is largely the same - the scene is framed by someone else, the decision about what should come next is made by someone else, and so on.  There's never a time in any game where any player can introduce anything they want.  That just never happens, even when someone is a GM in a traditional game like Call of Cthulhu. <br/><br/>So when you say the players might go so far out to left field by page 20 that the remaining 380 pages are useless, yes, that could happen, but your identification of only two options for what to do about this potentiality (or what to do if one finds oneself in the actuality) is problematic for me because both options seem alien to the whole idea of a Big Campaign Book, or even a small one, or a campaign designed without any book to hand at all.<br/><br/>For example, neither of your options suggests any pre-play preparation at all.  You can and should establish player buy-in the same way you do with a show in PTA or a dungeon in D&amp;D.  Hey, here is this thing we're doing. Here are the walls. Let me get some input from you on interesting things you want to be doing inside the walls.<br/><br/>Or pregenerated characters (doesn't Mountains of Madness use those?)  You rig the game. They can't put out the fire because nobody has the skills and resources to do it. Or whatever.<br/><br/>That's just two off the top of my head.  There are a lot more, maybe I will launch a thread about them to supplement the ones we've already had (Worldbuilding, Historical Gaming, etc.)<br/><br/>It's the duality, the idea that either one has to do SO MUCH WORK to accomodate player improvisation or TOTALLY IGNORE player contribution, that I am objecting to.<br/><br/>And you are correct, that is exactly why I got defensive and denied so firmly that I was an idiot.  Because I neither do all that much work nor ignore significant player contribution to story when I use Big Detailed Books of any variety.  Reading your previous posts it was clear that I cannot possibly be using the Big Campaign Books, because if I did, I would either be shitting on player contributions or be stuck in a mire of drudgery and busywork.  The two options were cruelty or idiocy.  Can you see how that could make one defensive?  (The real question is why I instinctively chose to be an idiot rather than cruel.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89233/#Comment_89233" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T14:51:16+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  2:51PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>But semantics of what a "script" is aside, and aside from the other uses of scripts in games, how is it different for a player to hear "Now there's a chase scene!" from another player when they're reading it out of the book, or when, for example, someone says "It's a chase scene!" in PTA when it's their turn to establish an agenda, or when the GM in Dogs in the Vineyard says, "He runs!" and the player sitting next to them says, "I give chase!"

Something a bit more constructive to put forward a newer model for thinking about Big Campaign Books. I'm taking this direction because it was said that you had to do the work of integrating the characters and players into the campaign anyway, which is something I only partly agree with.<br/><br/>So, instead of just providing a timeline, descriptions of significant events without huge player impact and various generic plot hooks, I propose something a little bit different. I think the book should have a section on integrating the characters in just the way I mentioned - in really investing them in the story. I don't mean half-hearted GMing advice either, but more concrete options players and GMs can choose to hardwire their characters into the situations.<br/><br/>For example, maybe you have a set of Plot Points which you can spend, primarily at character generation, but also as the campaign rolls on. There's a list of different options you can buy with them, including things like "illegitimate child of Arthur." They could be from a wide variety of power/influence levels, so there could be ones where you basically only get a magic sword and ones where you actually buy the opportunity to be Lancelot to Arthur and Guinevere, essentially taking his part by being the one who has a secret relationship with her. As you can see, some of these possibly have greater impact on the storyline. For example, if you are playing the knight who is having a secret affair with Guinever, things could play very differently towards the end of the campaign.<br/><br/>Now, there is a next, crucial step. The book would, instead of offering the typical generic plot hooks tied simply to the timeline, address these issues specifically. So, the issues that come up would each be associated with the different choices that the players might have taken. So, for example, the character with the magic sword might learn that it was originally stolen by his father and that there are still people who want it back. That's simple enough, but it gets more complex and should take inspiration from bangs. So, there's this woman who's telling you that you are Arthur's illegitimate son. What do you do? More bangs which tie you into the politics and prompt you to do something. Likewise for the knight playing the Lancelot role. Instead of just running through a retelling of the myth in railroaded fashion, certain key junctures would be converted into bangs that would really bring this story into the gaming table.<br/><br/>In this way, instead of a book full of generated content, you would have a book full of content generators.<br/><br/>Interestingly, a book written like that would have a very different flavor in its text. Even though most GMs customize and know how to work with things, Mike's point about the textual assumptions are interesting and in my experience realistic. While only a GM doing an extremely strict reading would go that route, the same can be said about the text in many places in the Great Pendragon Campaign. <br/><br/>I also want to make a note that I am also a bit leery of turning this congratulatory thread into something different. This is especially because even after the specific criticisms I've leveled at the product, I still consider it useful and very well done. However, because of my concerns, I end up thinking about it much more as a reference book, than a campaign book. So, that said, the book is grand, but my beef is with the overall state and prevalent assumptions/standards of practice of published scenario/campaign writing in the role-playing industry.<br/><br/>Joachim Buchert                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89261/#Comment_89261" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T16:41:04+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  4:41PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that idea a lot, so what you're suggesting is, when we sat down to generate characters, the campaign book would have a list like:<br/><br/>* possesses magic bullets<br/>* secretly the child of a werewolf lord<br/>* has a troublemaking but beloved cousin Claude<br/><br/>and so on, and then the campaign's timeline would be generated by things like:<br/><br/>"Magic Bullets, 1 - they are sought by Lee Harvey Oswald, here's some stuff about that, 2 - the possessor is required by faerie law to undertake the Grand Hunt, here's some stuff about that"<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>"Troublemaking Cousin Claude, 1 - he has a scheme to rip off France, here's some stuff about that, 2 - he's hiding from Inspector Phantome, here's some stuff about that",<br/><br/>then we take one from column A and one from column B (perhaps literally, stringing summary cards together on a timeline sheet?) and get the campaign timeline down?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89262/#Comment_89262" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T16:42:26+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  4:42PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The issue doesn't seem to be scene-framing; the issue is the outcomes being pre-determined.

I'm only trying to nail down what it is that's problematic for people like us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree, in a way, with the idea that you have to have some agreement about what the play is going to be about. At a minumum, you're agreeing to play the same RPG, with all that implies. And then you're agreeing to collaborate with each other to some extent. And, yes, you can agree to "play the adventure" presented. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, to elucidate a little, I find a module like ATMOM to have huge differences from something like a module like Steading of the Hill Giant Chief. You say that it's the same, in that you're getting players to agree to play inside a certain fence. But here's the difference, at least for me: with the SOTHGC module, the fence is just around the steading (both literally and figuratively). Once inside, the GM will ask, "do you go left or right?" and even possibly accept answers like, "We cut a hole through the wall here, instead of going left or right." The players have loads of interesting decisions to make that will affect the end result of the module (usually in terms of tactical success, but that's the mode of play supported by D&amp;D and that module). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn ATMOM, the fences are built around each scene. Or you have to break down the fences. And, for us again, worse than this is that each scene has only one path from it to the next. Here's the key. For players like myself at least, and probably Josh and others, it's the decisions that lead from scene to scene that we want to be making. I want to, as a player, be able to decide whether or not we do a chase scene next based on whether or not I feel that my character would chase after. To have that prescribed for me by the GM is, to me, to drain all joy from play. I am not content as a player to just roll the dice when needed, and fill in dialog. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, of course the GM can just break down the fence here, and ignore the text that says that the players will go chasing off after the monster, if the players don't seem to be into it. But then, if the next scene is to be of any use, he has to figure out how to get the players there. The easiest methods to use here, once again, take away the player authority to be making decisions that they feel are having impact. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor an example, with the chase example, the player say, instead, that they just write off whatever it was that they were supposed to be chasing. Iif this sounds like players being blocking jerks, then you haven't played with my players who can make such a decision quite pogniant in play. We're talking about honest play where the player is doing what he thinks is the most entertaining thing for everybody, based on the situation and his character, etc. So the players don't go, but I want to get in the scene where they come on their abducted compatriot about to be eaten. Well, I can say that the next day, when they head out, that they happen across him... it's plausible. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can even try to hide the fact that you've manipulated the text in order to produce this scene. I'm all for not adhering to some invisible "reality" behind the scenes, and making things dramatic. But the problem here is that you're taking the players' decision away from them. They've chosen to give up on this guy, and you've now said that it didn't matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this isn't the best example. In fact, I might do the same thing in my game, if I thought that a shot at redemption might be thematically interesting in the context of play. But the point is that players are intuitive about these things. They will know when you're maneuvering the scene to play off what they've done in a collaborative manner, and when you've done so because you believe that the events in the book are more interesting as written than the results of the actions that the players have had their characters take. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome players don't care about this. I don't want to get into a debate about how common these play styles are, let's just assume that there are healthy groups who play both ways. I myself played this way for, oh, two decades, and made as much fun of it as I could. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, see, here's the thing. There was always something about it that bothered me. In fact, when playing an RPG this way, I had very little fun. 20 minutes of fun packed into a 6 hour session, is the phrase that we often use to describe how such play feels. And it's not just playing, either. When running, even if the players seem somewhat satisfied with this sort of play at times, I never felt that I was getting the best from my players. Well, at least not what I wanted from them. They were very passive. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich should be no surprise, I wasn't allowing them a lot of leeway to create. And over the course of the 1990's I almost stopped playing RPGs because of this. My play diminished to a trickle. Something was unsatisfactory to me about how the games were going. I couldn't put my finger on it, but the epitome of it was when my friend Dave said one session, "Oh, I see, here's tonights plot." And then he hunkered down to be corralled through the fences that I put up routing them from scene to scene, only to brighten up again when he got some EXP at the end, and got to manipulate his Rolemaster character sheet (Dave loves spreadsheets). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did I play this way? Well, because that's how the books told me to play. Because I didn't know another way. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know better, yeah. But, OK, given a book that's written such as to inform this version of play, and given one that better supports the sort of play I want to see - where player decisions are the center of play, and everything revolves around that - can you see why I'd choose one over the other? Can you see why I might even be resentful for the two decades of not entirely satisfying play? That's not to say that I blame designers from that time. What else was there? If I wanted to give people an idea of some grand series of events, how not to provide it other than as a timeline of events? <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89471/#Comment_89471" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T09:52:07+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  9:52AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From above...<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, Josh says "Hates." I'd really only go so far as "don't prefer." Maybe as far as "would advocate others trying other methods that have given me so much success in play in terms of finally delivering what I want." I even use judgmental phraseology when I say something like "real decisions." Let's be clear, I am being judgmental about the sort of play that ATMOM best supports. I don't like it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut nowhere in any of that is, "You can't be having fun if you do it that way." I might even wonder how you're having fun using those methods, or if you might have fun with others. But if you tell me that you're having fun your way... then you can't be an idiot, or any other negative thing. You're taking it personally that our preferences may not match yours (may, because I'm not even sure we're that far apart). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the amount of effort involved, I don't know what to say. I know that less effort is, for me, better. That's all I mean by "lazy." And I know objectively that some presentations take less effort for me to use than others - that if I have to translate from having fences around each scene to having fences only around what the players want to do, that I find it a terrible bore. If, in fact, you're doing this sort of conversion, and it takes you so little effort that it's trivial, then... good for you. I wish it were the same for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can't understand how that might seem to be a lot of work for me, realize that I do near zero prep for play these days. I might read some setting source material at times (though I'm likely to do that on the fly, actually). So any work at all seems like a lot to me. Anyhow, I'm not sure that I'm capable of conveying exactly why it bugs me to have to deal with this. Again, maybe it's because I feel that I've been abused by this material. Assign any motive you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn't matter. It's my preference. What's more, since it's just my preference, it can't possibly havce any more weight than yours. So I'd ask that you try not to be quite as defensive on the subject. That's not to say it's not worth discussing. But let's approach it understanding that we have different perspectives. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich means that the folks on our side should probably try to bring down the level of toxicity against more traditional play here. I frankly don't think that we've been that bad overall, but that fits my bias, and there are obvious exceptions. And realize that we probably won't be altering Shreyas' behavior - again, you have to realize that he's militant about this. Many of us here are somewhat deeply invested in the "Story-games" movement - here meaning non-traditional play (trying to co-opt the term, JD, simply dilutes it). Not as some geeky social club, but in terms of having found a sort of play that we feel we were always looking for, and that finally makes RPG play astoundingly good for us. If we go overboard with sentiments stemming from the "bad old days," forgive us our bile if you can. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if anyone actually does come out and claim that you're not having the fun you say you are, or that you're less than intelligent because you play a traditional system, well, I'll stand by your side and defend you. I just ran a game of TFT at GenCon, and had a pretty good time of it. Pretty traditional game, that. I tried to approach it analytically - there's a lot of people in the SG community who, I think, are playing all of these retro games out of a sense of either guilt at how the community here may sometimes vent at them, or out of sheer nostalgia. I wanted to see if it was still actually any fun on it's own merits. And I had fun killing folks in a dungeon. I think that they mostly had fun, too (Rich, who asked for the game, seemed to have really enjoyed it). <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think we've lost all perspective - I think we're still handling questions of play preferences pretty analytically on the whole. But go ahead and call foul when we step over the line. It's good to have somebody playing conscience, I suppose. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the concepts that people are discussing in the last couple of posts in terms of presentation, they sound good to me. I'm less interested in a timeline (which has to be rearranged if things change) than with just ideas for events that could occur to make the PCs lives interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89530/#Comment_89530" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T12:24:08+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 12:24PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2007 12:25PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Internal server error ate my first response.

I might be extra talented, so I can breeze over problems with a contemptuous snap of my fingers, or I might just be oblivious to the grossly obvious blunders I make, I know which one my wife would pick, and, to my chagrin, she is usually right.<br/><br/>As far as boundaries go, I think you are definitely on to something.  I agree that definitely there are tight boundaries and loose boundaries around different things in different games and groups, and some boundaries are more flexible than others.  <br/><br/>My group freezes up and gets resentful when you give them too many choices, because none seems better than any other at that point, and they're likely to make a choice that someone else in the group will think is awful - not because of game structure, but just because of matters of taste.  My characters lie and cheat and con, my wife could really care less about that kind of thing and sees it as distracting.  In fact, I can't think of the last time "what do you do?" couldn't be supplemented with a list of clear options - sometimes a relatively long list, but finite.<br/><br/>I do remember one boundary that caused some angst - when I told everyone that in Gotham City, you never have a happy ending, you have closure only by protecting innocents and defeating evil <i>today</i>, it is a victory in that milieu if you stop things from getting worse.  At first the players were, as you describe feeling, fenced in.  Eventually, though, they embraced it because it gave them permission to be broodily attractive, or to build up high hopes that they knew OOCly, gleefully, would be dashed to pieces.  Knowing the ending, even sometimes knowing where each scene was going (not all, but some), gave them permission to stab their characters with knives without the fear that it was going to shock, and perhaps even hurt, them.<br/><br/>So definitely the looseness or tightness of the boundary matters, as well as where the boundaries are, and it's all a matter of taste. (As well as content. I don't think the players would have been so accepting if I hadn't been adapting something which I was very familiar with and was able to discuss on a number of levels.  In other words, I don't know that they'd accept the scene-ending idea in a GURPS Special Ops game all about cool tactics and outfits with buckles that don't mean anything.)<br/><br/>Anyway, peace and love to all mankind, and even Ted Turner.<br/><br/>Edit: Sorry to hear about guilt and such in your movement! My only movement is to rock back and forth on my porch while drinking lemonade with whiskey mixed in and watching the kids go past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89549/#Comment_89549" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T13:14:16+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  1:14PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not near perfect, but I'll take it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to try to get the thread back to any semblance of it's former self...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Great Pendragon Campaign.
