Things found in Value-Village and thrift stores,  things found in hardware store sections,  things found in kitchen supplies,  office supply stores,  used book store things,  etc... etc...  <br/>Neat  "found items"  or other  things that can be used double-duty for gaming fun!<br/><br/>Fun things that could inspire or be made by other GMs and groups, if possible.  Suggestions for  "how to guides"  on making things that you like using for gaming fun!  From battle-grid counters for NPCs,  initiative keepers,  condition keepers,  battle-mats,  miniatures,  action/hero points,  easy terrain,   etc... etc...  anything that is unique that you've used or seen used for game fun.<br/><br/>Things to help make a game toolbox/kit for things to help play be more fun or go smoothly...<br/>Even your game table setup,  back-pack materials,  etc...<br/>I've seen all the  "ultimate game table"  images and such -  those are great,  but NOT practical to anyone without the MONEY or place to put them...  So I'm talking more about things you can make/find for cheap  and ALSO tuck away under the couch or pack in a backpack easy!<br/><br/><br/>I'll take some photos of things I use  or  have considered making and post later.<br/>I'd like to see other people's  "kits"  for what they use to game with!!  For inspiration on my own.<br/><br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284068/#Comment_284068" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T19:33:00+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  7:33PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2010 7:34PM by Hans_c-o.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite><br/>I'm talking about things you've made by hand.

I rifled through it and found a ceramic monk figure, took him home, bashed off his head, and mounted it on a small piece of wood. This is going to be my heretic figure for the game:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9558/monkw.jpg"/><br/><br/>This is going to be my Cathar cross. It's not yellow, but it's roughly square, which the Cathar cross is and the Catholic &amp;c. crosses aren't. It's also burnt (I took some wood, bashed it apart, nailed it together, and set it on fire), which fits nicely with the theme and mood of the game, I think:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/6224/crossn.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
