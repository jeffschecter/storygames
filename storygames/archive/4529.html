I've never played Polaris myself, though I've read it a few times and I listed to Paul Tevis's AP recordings, so I feel like I have a fairly good idea about how the game works.  Still, my gaming roots are mostly in "traditional" (or whatever the hell we're calling them this week) games with relatively little story game experience.<br/><br/>So.  I was wondering if anyone out there has ever done Polaris with non-gamers and could offer some advice for how to teach it and get it going as smoothly as possible.  Of course, I'm also looking for any more general advice about making Polaris awesome as well.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
