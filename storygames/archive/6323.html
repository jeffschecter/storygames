IPR is still the cheapest if you carefully balance your order (I wonder if in certain border cases it is not cheaper to order in two shippings instead of in one.)<br/><br/>To give you an idea, with a sample of 3 games:\n<ol><li><b>IPR</b> (USA): 48.98 \u20ac (+ random customs taxes and delay) with 5$ shipping rebate (shipping is 19% of price)(without rebate: 52.12\u20ac, shipping is 25%)[now if I add one game, shipping costs are doubled!]</li>\n<li><b>Leisure Games</b> (UK): 54.88 \u20ac (+ possible unknown customs tax?)(shipping is 17%)</li>\n<li><b>Sph\xe4renmeisters Spiele</b> (D): 66.85 \u20ac (shipping is\u2026 4% !)</li>\n<li><b>Fantask </b>(DK): ? 94\u20ac (the website asks for credit card information before adding the shipping cost, so I had to estimate this. I think I understood a 20% shipping charge was asked for, but I am not very sure as I do not speak Danish (Online dictionaries seem to have problems with agglutinated words).<i>It still would be the most expensive even if shipping was free.</i></li></ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140606/#Comment_140606" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T01:50:25+00:00" title="April 21, 2008  1:50AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK<br/><br/>I finally decided to buy pdfs from IPR.
