We often predict negative - it seems "more realistic" to many people. The goal of therapy is to help people begin to see adversity in other ways. Reframe the meaning of what is going on. <br/><br/>I do this with myself all the time. I feel a feeling in my throat or stomach and recognize that is it excitement rather than call it fear or anxiety. I accept that it is uncomfortable but I also recognize that is is very temporary (as are all feelings/emotions/sensations). I maximize my pleasure not by denying negative uncomfortableness but by accepting it immediately and letting it pass. It works!<br/><br/>I'm not immediately seeing how it player into gaming except that how we understand things greatly affects the idea of rewards. For instance -  while I've not played Dogs in the Vinyard - I have a strategy of play that might be very annoying to the GM and other players. I don't like violence so I would come into a town and accept loss after loss rather than escalate situationsl. Each interaction would give me more ideas about what was happening in the town. When I felt I knew what was going on I would call the towns people to an open meeting. I would ask who I thought was responsible to come forward and without warning I would shoot them No escalation - just sudden execution. Then I would explain what God showed me was going on in their town and give them a stern warning to fly straight. Because I would have been seen as weak by the towns people by then they would not see it coming. The shock would thus be greater and the lesson to be wary of the Devil all the greater because you cannot judge based on surface information. As word spread of my justice people would begin to fear my coming so the terror of the dogs would spread far and wide. I would be practicing real terrorism.<br/><br/>This is my thought based on my revulsion to playing a religious policeman who is judge jury and executioner. I know from years of study of policing that this kind of absolute power leads to the worst kind of corruption. Accepting defeat in all matters except the last would be the humbling antidote to the power. Gandhi with a gun. <br/><br/>So I've run this scenario through my head and realize that it is based off of my political believes and prejudices and that they really shouldn't come into games so I would recognize the beliefs and change my behavior in the game so as not to screw things up for the rest of the players. Which in RET land would lead me to different consequences. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329274/#Comment_329274" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T17:55:56+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  5:55PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris,<br/><br/>I would LOVE to play Dogs with you. Because the game is all about someone coming at it with high hopes and ideals and preconceptions, and then problematising those. Typically the arc goes "Idealistic kids =&gt; bitter nihilists" but it's just as enjoyable when someone without hope sees a genuine opportunity to do good.<br/><br/>As someone who is very skeptical about religious belief, I thought that I would find it hard to get into Dogs, since I'm already cynical about the Dogs' ability to do good in the world. But actually I found the game incredibly engaging - seeing the places where the Faith genuinely works for the people of the town, seeing the potential for the Dogs to actually do good, in this deeply problematic context, that was troubling and engaging and challenging for me, and I think maybe you'd find the same thing.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I found Montsegur 1244 really hard to get into because I just couldn't identify with the Cathar faith. It seemed to embody the worst aspects of faith, precluding any joy or love of life in its adherants. For someone to die for this faith just seemed like a stupid tragedy for me. I couldn't make it feel like a genuinely hard choice for me as a player, or for the character.<br/><br/>Todd,<br/><br/>I got nothing for you, I'm afraid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329278/#Comment_329278" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T18:07:30+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  6:07PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm surprised that you think that that approach would be disruptive to your average game of Dogs.

I'd lead the players into dark holes and then make them start making spot hidden rolls. Each success would bring another small of terrifying observation. I got them to the point where they didn't want to pass their checks. They didn't want to see anymore. They had to stop looking to save what little was left of their minds. Then I'd put them in "Saw" like delimas. "I only want one. Only one of you has to decide. Pick one..." That was a very dark period of my life and it came out creatively in those games. I don't want to go back there again.<br/><br/>Todd<br/><br/>You're right that Engle Matrix games are like RET. I use a version of the game in therapy: "Bob's Brain". The players are Bob's brain.

Then we go around the room adding to the story with the occasional counter-argument so they can see  self talk fighting it out.

As such, we need to rely on categorizations, generalizations, maxims and other shortcuts in order to (1) choose what stimuli to process through attention and which to ignore and (2) burn information in our long term memory in a way that's effective in terms of storage and retrieval. Mind you, these are not conscious processes, but they happening nonetheless: we just don't have the hardware to do otherwise.<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly how one would go about this, but considering that cognitive distortions arise and get replaced based on what stimuli is important to process and what information is important to store in a phase of your life, you could certainly track their evolution through some kind of lifepath thingie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336452/#Comment_336452" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-30T10:48:17+00:00" title="July 30, 2011 10:48AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lifepaths are the way to go if you want to develop a character with a rich backstory, or want a character deep-enough to use in a long campaign.<br/><br/>But I tend toward games where backstory is just a rough sketch, and it's pretty clear which personality-bits will be highlighted in a single session or a single arc of maybe 2,3,4 episodes.<br/><br/>Which would makes it even easier to simply tag a character with 'emotional reasoning' or 'jumping to conclusions' and then watch them flail.<br/><br/>Halfway between the lifepath and the one-shot trait, would be to assign cognitive distortions as Fallout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
