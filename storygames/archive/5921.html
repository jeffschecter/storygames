I hope you don't mind. It's so long I'll split it in two.<br/><br/><b>(1)</b><br/>When we consider an RPG system in and by itself, we are guided in our judgment by a certain set of presuppositions, a theory if you will, about how it will actually be used, at the table, in actual play. This theory might or might not coincide with reality. A greater understanding of how systems are used will assist us when we attempt to assess them, and will also increase our understanding about the dynamics of the gaming table.<br/><br/>The usual, straightforward model would be, that the players come to the table with some, more or less well-defined, creative agenda. They pick a system, often in the form of some pre-written rules-set, and follow it. Hopefully, it contributes towards their fulfilling their creative agenda, in which case they will continue using it. Otherwise, they might discard it or modify it.<br/><br/>I will suggest that a more complex dynamic is in fact in operation when systems are used. I will try to explain this idea by the introduction of something I call a virtual actor, or just an actor. We can understand what the actor is by reference to literary theory. In this field, a distinction is made by the author of a book, and its narrator. The author is the real person, the man or woman of flesh and blood who actually wrote the book. The narrator, on the other hand, is wholly fictitious, virtual: he is the mouth in which the author places the words of the fiction. The narrator is most visible when he refers to himself as "I", as in books narrated in the 1st person, but he crops up elsewhere too. The narrator, then, exists wholly on the plane of the fiction itself.<br/><br/>The actor, similarly, is a virtual individual who exists wholly on the plane of the system. He arises on the initiative of the player in response to the system, and his purpose is to mediate between the player and the system, much like the purpose of the narrator is to mediate between the author and the fiction. What, then, is the purpose of the actor and how does he come about?<br/><br/><b>(2)</b><br/>Consider <b>Polaris</b>. Polaris is a game in what could perhaps be called the "story game" tradition and it is more or less explicitly acknowledged that players come to Polaris with the intent of creating and experiencing good stories together, where "good" in these circumstances mean more precisely "chivalric and tragical". People, then, come into the game with a cooperative agenda. However, peculiarly, the game rules presuppose a certain amount of antagonism between the players. The core of the game is the innovative conflict resolution system in which the stakes of the conflict, and thus the dramatical weight of the narrative, is continually raised. In order to make these rules do what they are intended to do, i e, contribute to the creation of an epic, tense narrative, players must make use of the conflict system, which presupposes that they act in opposition to each other.<br/><br/>However, the system is not built for antagonism between players. It has no checks and balances, no central GM authority with final say on matters. All is very loosely held and allows for very much fiddling. And in fact, it is, as I previously noted, more or less presupposed that players will in fact act in concert to make a good story.<br/><br/>This, then, seems like a paradox. On the one hand, the system can't handle antagonism, and on the other hand, it requires antagonism in order to do its job properly. Despite this, people seem to be able to enjoy Polaris \u2014 I am myself one of them. So how is the paradox resolved? My answer is as follows. In being confronted with this property of system, the player resolves to act in a certain way. He will follow the overall spirit of cooperation and contribution to the common story most of the time, but when time comes to make use of the conflict resolution rules, he will suddenly "change personality" and act as if he had an antagonistic agenda. This "as if" can be expressed in another way: the player creates a virtual persona, the actor, who has an antagonistic agenda, and when this antagonistic agenda is required for the system to work as intended, the player hands over control to the actor.<br/><br/>This, then, is what I mean by an "actor": a virtual persona created by the player in response to the system, who is allowed to make certain decisions according to "his" agenda in order to make the system work as intended. Some things will be immediately apparent: 1) The actor is, for the most part, not made explicit, neither in the rules text nor around the table. It would be interesting to examine to what extent the making explicit of the actor could contribute to the play experience. 2) The actor cannot be equated with the character, since he has meta-knowledge about the game and the rules. 3) By introducing the actor, we have to abandon the simplistic idea, to the extent that we held it before, that system is just an algorithm which one runs through in the hope of getting the desired type of game as output. System actually influences the way players act, play and think. 4) The actor exists on the system plane. He is created in response to the system, to make it work. Each system will give rise to its own actor/s. The actor, then, can be considered a part of the system.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calvino" title="Calvino"><img alt="Calvino" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calvino">Calvino</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132332/#Comment_132332" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T11:15:19+00:00" title="March  4, 2008 11:15AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2008 11:15AM by Calvino.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>(3)</b><br/>I think the notion of the actor can be developed into a powerful analytical tool. In order to give the reader a better understanding of the concept, I will provide some more examples.<br/><br/>(The following seven paragraphs were written by Simon Petterson)<br/>Consider <b>The Shab al-Hiri Roach</b>. On the surface, this game appears to be competitive. There's even a win condition. The one who has the most Reputation at the end of the game wins. The problem is, if you really play the game to win, the game will break apart in a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>An example of this is the framing of conflicts. You get extra dice for every named character you narrate into the scene on your side. There's no limit on the number, here, so the logical thing to do, if you're playing to win, is to narrate in a heap of named characters into every conflict. Yet, nobody does this, as it would ruin the game.<br/><br/>In the same way, the logical thing to do when framing a conflict is to always twist the story so that both your Enthusiasms and your Expertise come into play, in every single conflict. This isn't so hard to do, if you're willing to let the story suffer, and it's enough with one type of conflict that fulfills that criterion, because then you can repeat it over and over again. However, this would also lead to boring play.<br/><br/>And again, trying to resist the roach's command. This demands that you sacrifice a point of Reputation for no mechanical benefit whatsoever. Since the actual story has no real way of influencing the mechanics, this would always be a bad choice if you play to win. And yet, people do this in play.<br/><br/>If you take only the player into consideration, the explanation would simply have to be that people don't play the game with the goal of winning. However, this is not really true. People do frame conflicts that are to their advantage, even if they don't go so far as to twist the story to do it. There are two conflicting goals here, that are both pursued simultaneously.<br/><br/>The explanation to this phenomenon can be found in the theory of the virtual actor. the player is mostly interested in creating a good story, but for this to happen, there needs to be conflict and competition. However, this competition needs to be kept in check so that it does not ruin the game. Thus, the player is constantly driving towards the goal of the good story, but he is pushed to make certain decisions by the actor, who is trying to win the game.<br/><br/>An example of this is the setting of scenes and the staking of Reputation. These two cannot be performed by the same "entity". The player is interested in the story, and as such, has no interest in the number of Reputation set at stake, since this has no effect on the story. The actor, on the other hand, is trying to win, and cannot be allowed to frame the scene, or all those things exemplified above will occur. The solution is, then, to let the player set the scene, and the actor evaluate the risks involved, and stake a number of Reputation appropriately.<br/><br/>Another example: On Swedish rpg forum <a href="http://forum.rollspel.nu" rel="nofollow">www.rollspel.nu</a>, criticism has sometimes been raised against what has been called "my-turn-to-say-something points", i e, some kind of currency used within the game by players to gain extra narrative rights (like the "drama points" in the Buffy RPG). Often, these self-same points can also be used to gain tactical advantages within the framework of the rules, such as, for instance, a bonus to an attack roll. The criticism is based on the seeming incommensurability between these two uses: there is no sense in having one kind of currency which gives the character either power over the story \u2014 used to introduce cool ideas and make the story better \u2014 or tactical advantages that help the characters along, since these two goals, better story and tactical advantage, are often opposed to each other. This has led some to wholly reject the use of my-turn-to-say-something points in their game design, claiming that they could not possibly work. However, I think it's an empirical fact that they do work, and that we need to try to understand why, if the criticism is right, this is still the case. And here, once again, the actor comes along to help us. On my hypothesis, the solution to the mystery would simply be this: the player, when using my-turn-to-say-something points, simply constructs an actor which takes care of one aspect of the point use \u2014 either the "better story" or the "tactical advantage" aspect \u2014 while he takes care of the other aspect himself.<br/><br/><br/>In a common style of play which could perhaps be described as "setting-heavy simulationism", borrowing a little GNS terminology, an important aspect of the enjoyment derived from the game lies in the sense of being "transported" to another word. This experience necessitates the "suspension of disbelief", an important part of which is to act in accordance with what the knowledge and attitudes the character could be assumed to possess (i e avoid "metagaming) and in other ways behave as if the world was a real world and not the creation of a fickle GM. Presumably, however, this kind of behavior is seldom the ultimate agenda of the player (if it is, the game becomes something akin to "deep immersion", which I discuss below). More likely, the "in character" agenda is transferred to an actor, leaving the player free to follow his own ultimate goals when they coincide with this agenda.<br/><br/><b>(4)</b><br/>Is there always an actor? My intuition is "no". In fact, I believe that certain styles of play can be characterized by their lack of an actor. I'm thinking here, primarily, of highly competitive gamist play, on the one hand, and what could perhaps be termed "deep immersion", on the other.<br/><br/>In a game like D&amp;D, there's a rule for almost every circumstance. In case there isn't, the GM has complete adjudicatory power. These properties of the D&amp;D system makes the use of an actor unnecessary, and in fact, I would not be afraid of suggesting that this was indeed the purpose of designing them such (even though the concept of the actor was most likely not explicitly held in mind). It could probably be argued from the perspective of a player used to this kind of rules that a game that necessitates the use of an actor is broken. In such a game as D&amp;D, all players can have a remorselessly antagonistic agenda (antagonistic towards the GM, that is), and the game will work just fine even if all decisions are made in accordance with this agenda. D&amp;D-style play, then, is a style of play that removes the actor by placing all decisions in the hands of the player.<br/><br/>Deep immersion could, a bit vaguely, be characterized as a style of play where the player attempts to "identify" with his character in all respects, to act like him, react like him, feel like him and think like him. The Turku manifesto comes to mind. In this style of play, there would be no need of an actor, since the player simply always acts like his character would be presumed to act. Deep immersion, then, is a style of play that gets rid of the actor by placing all decisions in the hands of the character.<br/><br/><b>(5)</b><br/>That's all I've got, for now. However, I think this idea has potential to be elaborated further. Moreover, I believe that the actor is only one of a potentially large number of similar structures and patterns at work in the actual practice of roleplaying, that could be unearthed with further study and deeper analysis.<br/><br/>I am indebted to Simon Pettersson, Mikael Bergstr\xf6m and Arvid Axbrink for helping me elaborate these ideas, and to Simon in particular for providing me with the Roach example.<br/><br/>/Karl Bergman                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132360/#Comment_132360" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T11:58:13+00:00" title="March  4, 2008 11:58AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2008 12:46AM by Per_Fischer.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Karl,<br/><br/>Still not done reading - it's LONG <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But I already have a question that bothers me slightly and makes me wonder whether you have based your analysis on something that doesn't hold water. It's about Polaris:<br/>Why do you assume that a game system needs "checks and balances" and a "central GM authority with final say on matters" to be "built for antagonism between players"? Polaris handles antagonism very well, or do you mean something different by antagonism perhaps?<br/><br/>That Polaris should be a fundamentally cooperative game strikes me as very odd as well. The fiction in Polaris is constantly being negotiated via the conflict resolution rules, as in most other story games that I know of. It's most definitely not a storytelling game in a consensual sense - did you play it like that?<br/><br/>Also: I'm not sure what an 'actor' is yet in your view, but as I said, I'm not nearly through.<br/>EDIT: Finished reading, I still have the same questions, and I still don't get what "actor" is. Perhaps the term in itself is misleading but replacing the word with "xxx" or "mindset" didn't help either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132459/#Comment_132459" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T18:27:55+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  6:27PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darn it, board ate my long post.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuick version: I disagree that Polaris conflict statements are anything but player versus player.

You are forbidden/strongly discouraged in Polaris to make statements that you believe makes the narrative (slightly) worse, solely because you think the other player will think it makes the narrative extremely worse. It's not a zero sum game, where whatever hurts the player across from you must necessarily benefit you and vice versa. However, you are allowed to be "selfish" to a large extent. Introduce whatever YOU want into the narrative. If the other player objects, he has the tools to protect himself or amend your statement.

Can you elucidate it?<br/><br/>Additionally, and probaby because I can't understand the above, I think that there's something odd going on with your analysis. Particularly, you seem to have an unspoken axiom at work: that cooperation and competition are opposites, and cannot meaningfully coexist. Are you actually saying that? Because it's flatly not true.</blockquote>\nThat would be the opposite of what I'm saying. Rather, I'm trying to provide an analysis of how or why they can coexist. Because I think its an empirical fact that they can.<br/><br/>The analogue with the author/narrator distinction goes like this: as the narrator is a virtual person, on the level of the narrative, through which the author "speaks", so the actor is a virtual person, on the level of the system, through which the player "acts". \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cydmab</cite>Quick version: I disagree that Polaris conflict statements are anything but player versus player. I have one vision of what should happen next, the mistaken has a different vision, the conflict mechanic helps resolve this "conflict" between player-level visions.</blockquote>\nIndeed. The conflict I'm talking about isn't the conflicting visions between players, but, really, the conflict between characters in the game-world. Maybe I was vague here. In Polaris, the Heart speaks for the hero, the Mistaken for the villains. In order for a good, dramatic story about this conflict to emerge, these two players must to some extent take the "side" of their respective characters. However, as, for instance, the mistaken, it is not in my interest to do whatever the rules allow me in order for my characters to "win", because if I succeeded, that would make for a sucky story. The villain can't be allowed to kill the hero in the first act.<br/><br/>This, then, is something else than player-level aesthetic visions, which can of course also differ. But no matter what each individual player wants from the plot, it is presumably in the interest of all players that an aesthetically satisfying story emerges as the result of the game. This, I believe, cannot happen if every player acts in the best interest of his character, but it also cannot happen unless people act in the best interest of their characters. That is the paradox I tried to solve by introducing the actor.<br/><br/>I think this adresses some of y'all else's concerns, as well. Did it get any clearer?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Isn't this true of something like...oh...a pickup basketball game? There' s no referee and there is definitely player vs. player antagonism, but having a fun game relies on everyone following certain agreed upon rules. The fun depends entirely upon competing players cooperating within system.</blockquote>\nThe difference would be, that in a basketball game, the rules are explicit and clear, and unless you follow them, you are a cheat. In a role-playing game, there is also explicit, clear rules, but the actor isn't part of them. He is part of an implicit, unclear addendum to the rules, created on the fly to make them work better.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anders Larsen</cite><br/>Do you have any though about how this could be used if we are more conscious about it?</blockquote>\nI think that it is of general value in the analysis of rpg systems. The background to the article is basically this: on my home forum, <a href="http://www.rollspel.nu" rel="nofollow">www.rollspel.nu</a>, Forge systems are sometimes criticized on the grounds of "paradoxes" like the one in Polaris and the Roach. People will say, "it's bad game design", and then some other people will say, "but obviously people play these games and have fun". Now I'm in the latter camp, but I wanted to explain <i>why</i> people can play these game and have fun despite the so called "bad design". So for me personally, the greatest importance of my analysis will probably be that I won't be as afraid of introducing this kind of "paradox" in my designs, and maybe even start to explore them as a positive design parameter. <br/><br/>By the way, your name sounds Danish.

Perhaps there is a good analysis of how this works somewhere, written by someone, but I've never seen one. Has anyone else here? Post a link, please!<br/><br/>The contrast is really obvious when looking at the GM role in a traditional RPG. The GM provides adversity for the players, but only within the framework of a collaborative endeavour. The GM is not trying to 'win' but merely to provide challenge and enjoy the back-and-forth.<br/><br/>When we sit down to play Polaris, we engage in conflict not because we're trying to win something, but because we trust that the process will create something interesting. It's kind of like the GM example. <br/><br/>What could a good analogy be? Maybe two players playing chess in a peculiar way: as they play, every few turns one player will say to the other, "I'm gaining a strong advantage over you. Maybe this would be a good time to remove one Rook on my side?" The players aren't playing to prove who is better--they just want to be involved in an interesting chess match and enjoy watching it develop.<br/><br/>The collaborative agreement to create story and face challenge is overarching, whereas elements of conflict engaged within the story are entered in some sort of limbo between collaboration and competition.<br/><br/>In a game like Polaris, the players trust each other to act out certain roles--namely, that the Heart will attempt to push their protagonist in a certain direction, and that the Mistaken will resist them or throw threats at them. <br/><br/>When you and I sit down and set stakes in a conflict, then roll the dice to see which happens, even if we're each hoping for a certain outcome, we're both happy knowing that, _even if we don't get our way in this conflict_, the game will be fun--when your character fails, you can still feel like you're "winning", smiling and laughing and enjoying the process. As soon as we came up with negative and positive stakes we were both excited about, we knew we would "win" no matter what. <br/><br/>We're not really competing. We're just sticking to an agreement to compete within a certain role in the game. "I, Paul T., hereby vow to take action in the game so as to further the desires of [this character] and, within their abilities, oppose [that character]." <br/><br/>After that, we're trusting the process of the game system to produce something enjoyable. That push to create conflict and competition is the fuel for the process, not strictly directed at another player.<br/><br/>(Yes, this is not applicable to all RPGs.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132730/#Comment_132730" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T13:58:03+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  1:58PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Karl -- my real first name is also Karl.

Anyway: the actor is, of course, a "theorist's fiction" and in that sense, it <i>doesn't</i> exist. It's a way of describing certain phenomena. We could just as well describe it as, for instance, a "voluntary, self-imposed split-personality disorder", "alternating mental processes" (to quote SabreCat) or something like it. I just thought that the "actor" was an evocative way of talking about these things. Perhaps I was wrong.<br/><br/>As for the author/narrator thing: I cannot agree that this distinction is absent in oral storytelling. The limiting case would be me reading aloud a book with an obvious narrator, but even when the story is more suited to the form, I have the option of putting on a show, of <i>implying</i> a narrator through my choices of words and the opinions and world view I express through the story -- choices, opinions and world view which might be different from my own.<br/><br/>Like Max Higley notes, roleplaying is all about enacting "virtual" characters. All performative media have this trait at its root. This is why there can be a "narrator" in oral storytelling: oral storytelling is, or can be, a performative medium, and in so far as the storyteller "performs" the character of a narrator, there is a narrator. The actor differs from a "normal" character only in that it exists at the level of the system rather than at the level of the fiction. Note, then, that the "formal" rpg correspondent of the narrator would simply be the PC: the analogy between narrator and actor depends rather on the fact that in both cases, these virtual people are "one level up" from the <i>important</i> level, i e, the level of the fiction: in the case of oral storytelling, one level up from the actual narrative; in the case of role-playing, one level up from the game world (at the level of the system).<br/><br/>As for your other objections: please share them, if you have the time and energy. I would particularly be interested in what you have to say about basketball. However, I'm afraid that I can't really discuss the Roach: I haven't played it, and that part of the article was written by my friend. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>- Kalle<br/><br/>PS: I'm a bit busy now but I'll respond to the rest of y'all later.<br/><br/>Edit: I clarified the end of the 3rd paragraph.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132975/#Comment_132975" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T12:31:46+00:00" title="March  6, 2008 12:31PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 12:34PM by Ben_Lehman.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So is the concept similar to "good sportsmanship" in, say, basketball?

Rather, it's just that people are not totally asocial, and games (all games, including sports) are designed to ride on top of a pre-existing social structure rather than be played by totally asocial beings interested only in victory conditions. (we might pretend to be totally asocial beings interested only in victory conditions for the purposes of playing a game -- for instance, when we play chess.

I'll see what I can say about them.<br/><br/>Human beings, in a very real sense, are always enacting roles. A number of sociologists -- Erwing Goffman comes to mind -- have successfully analyzed much of social life in terms of performance; roles, scripts, stage, backstage, props &amp;c. I really don't think there is any kind of "baseline individual" which is <i>the real person</i>. Certainly, some roles are more "real" than others, but this is a gliding scale, and at any rate, there will never be <i>one</i> person which is the <i>real</i> one but always a conglomerate, a "board of directors" of the soul which together constitute the personality of a man.<br/><br/>So what I'm trying to say here is that I do not see that a "split personality" would have to be something <i>aberrant</i> which deviates from a "baseline of human behavior". An explanation in terms of different roles, actors or whatever does, on the contrary, accord well with a central feature of what it is to be human. <br/><br/>So basically, I agree that something similar goes on in a basketball game, but I don't agree that this is grounds to reject my analysis. Anyway: the problem with your basketball analogue is that it actually misses the point: the "actor" in my analysis of Polaris wouldn't correspond to the "sportsman" -- I believe that, in games, the goal of "having fun" always trumps the goal of "winning", since the latter is basically a way of achieving the former (professional sports would be the exception to this) -- but rather, to that wild brute who wants to win no matter what. The sportsman, well, that's actually you, to the extent that you see that the rules of the game aren't in themselves strong enough to support enjoyable play.<br/><br/>But the point you raise is nevertheless valid, and enlightening, and I see now that what I have tried to account for through the actor for is actually something that must necessarily take place in every game, although more so in some than in others. Given how much I've read on the sociology of games, I really should've realized this sooner. Well, I'm gonna take a long, hard think about this, and then maybe some sort of dialectical synthesis between our respective views can emerge.<br/><br/>- Kalle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133124/#Comment_133124" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T23:47:44+00:00" title="March  6, 2008 11:47PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 11:51PM by noclue.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Calvino</cite>but rather, to that wild brute who wants to win no matter what.</blockquote>Does anyone else feel a sense of irony talking about victory in a discussion of <i>Polaris </i>of all things?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133143/#Comment_133143" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T03:54:34+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:54AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, everyone. I'm the guy who wrote the part of the above article concerning the Roach. When Karl posted the original theory on rollspel.nu, I was impressed, as it actually explained to me how a game such as the Roach could work.<br/><br/>First, some background. there's an ingenious guy on the swedish forums called Rising, who's done wonders in developing theories for games he call "problem solving" games (which is similar to, but not the same thing as, GNS Gamism). His number one rule reads "The best way of playing should be the most fun". This is the baseline rule of all competitive gaming, as I see it. I've played a board game that didn't follow that rule, and it was just awful. Same goes for some problem solving RPGs.<br/><br/>The Roach isn't, in essence, a problem solving game, but more of a story-focused one. However, it does have a win condition, so there's definitly a "best" way of playing the game. And that's not a very fun way (see the part written by me in the original post of this thread).<br/><br/>This used to bother me a lot. The game forces the player into decisions where he has to choose between having fun and trying to win the game, I thought, an example being choosing between resisting the command when the story demands it (having fun) and keeping that point of Reputation (trying to win). And if you don't try to win the game, what's the point of having a win condition?<br/><br/>But then I read about Karl's "actor" theory, and suddenly, it made a lot more sense. If you think of it as two different entities pursuing the two different goals, it is no longer neccessary to make that choice! The player always goes for the better story, and the actor always goes for the win. Sure, it's just an artificial construct (and it may have some flaws as an analogy), but somehow, I could see how this kind of game could actually work.<br/><br/>Now, true problem solving games strive to remove this actor from the equation, and that leads to another kind of fun (D&amp;D would be a prime example of this). But this way of thinking about it makes me see why the Roach might not be broken, after all.<br/><br/>(And now, the funny thing is, as I'm writing this, I realize I think the Roach would be a better game without the win condition. If Reputation would just be a measurement of the character's reputation, instead of a parameter that allows you to win or lose the game, there would be a point in making the decision "What will screw my life up more: obeying the command or getting roaring drunk at the Wine and Cheese social?". But I think that might be beside the point. Making that change would just make the actor less obvious, not remove the need for it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133149/#Comment_133149" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T05:16:31+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  5:16AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There seems to be confusion about the Roach winning condition.

On the one hand, the existence of a win condition implies you ought to be trying to win, and if you're really trying, then you ought to be using the best possible strategy.  But if you use the most effective strategy for gaining reputation, the game isn't as much fun as it otherwise.  So then, maybe you're not supposed to attempt to reach the win condition and instead shoot for good story?  But then, why is the win condition there?  It's a double-bind for the players -- which doesn't make it bad, just <i>apparently</i> paradoxical, <i>from a theoretical perspective</i>.  I've played the game, I know it works, but I still can't explain how these go together (until now.)<br/><br/>This piece of theory looks at it and says "Yes, the players have two apparently contradictory goals.  But it's not a contradiction, and the game can work with both being pursued at once, because the goals are being pursued on two different levels."  One of those levels is me as a real person who enjoys stories.  The other level is me as a player, an abstract concept that excludes large parts of my eating and shitting reality.  Because it excludes so much of my reality, it is in a sense virtual.  Those parts of me that fit into "me as a player" can be lumped together, and called a virtual person/actor (in the same way that "me as a character" is a virtual person/actor.)<br/><br/>And then it makes sense!  I, as a player, am aiming to win.  But I, as a person, am aiming for a good, enjoyable story.  And person-me can constrain the choices of player-me to make sure that good story results, while still leaving me a decent shot at winning.  The virtual actor concept serves to add a bit of distance between person-me and player-me, so that I can see that one is constraining the other.<br/><br/>The Roach has always been a fine game, whether I understood how story and winning interacted or not.  Now I feel like I have a handle on why the apparent paradox doesn't destroy the experience.

The more immersive the game the more of an issue that can be, to the level of players rejecting mechanical advantage because they can't imagine that their character would choose to act in a way suitable of taking that advantage (e.g. "Yes I know I've got a 75% chance of a shot to the eye that would do twice as much damage, but my character has never hurt anyone so badly in real life and he just wouldn't so it, he'll just hit him in the stomach").<br/><br/>That sort of behaviour only makes sense if the player chooses to act primarily as the character and not themselves at that point. This is not the same as choosing not to be gamist, because at other points when they feel the character motivation is neutral on something they will happily perform some boring activity for XP, make a metagame based choice, and so forth.<br/><br/>Having a rule system with a shared currency that is used in different ways for the best interests of the player and the character brings this contrast into sharper focus, but I think it is a factor of most gaming that is not purely 'gamist'. (On the other hand I have played, briefly, with people who never experienced this actor role at all, being totally gamist and doing things purely for the mechanical advantage with no regard for character motivation. Such an experience only hilights that something different is going on in most people's play)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133177/#Comment_133177" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T07:35:49+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  7:35AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am extremely interested in supporting the difference between player and character, if that makes any sense.

I shouldn't have said "better game", but rather "a game I'd have liked better". I think that the reason for my problems with the Roach is that I come from a different RPG and theory background. Because of said Rising on our forums, there has been a lot of talk about what contitutes good "gamey" design, and how you design a rules system in which the player decisions influence the mechanical outcome in a tactically challenging way (which, since our tradition is based on Basic Roleplaying rather than D&amp;D, is not very common in Swedish trad designs). So when there's a win condition, I automatically see it as a challenge. So I approached the Roach much as I'd approach a combat in D&amp;D (which, incidentally, I've barely even set eyes on). Play to win. But then I found that as play progressed, I wasn't really doing all I could to win. And it felt very paradoxical to me, especially when I looked at the game from a theoretical viewpoint.

Even if people find my ideas enlightening, I can't help but suspect that it's perhaps just a case of having to stare at the obvious until one realizes that one knew it all along. And then, of course, we have the familiar syndrome where one theorist comes along and messes everything up with nonsensical ideas (that would be our friend Rising), and then, later, some other theorist has to clean up the mess by stating once again what everyone already knew.<br/><br/>I'm getting the feel, reading y'all's comments, that this is, perhaps, such an idea, although that doesn't necessarily make it <i>bad</i> -- obviously a truism is at least true --- but perhaps a bit misleading and confusing. I interpret much of Ben Lehman's objections -- perhaps mistakenly --- as the inability to pierce the shroud of technical jargon and realize that, hey, he was only talking about that trivial fact all along. If this is so, I take full responsibility for the misunderstanding.<br/><br/>I think perhaps that if this theory has contributed anything to the large-scale understanding of role-playing, it isn't the simple observation that these kinds of processes and structures exist, but, rather, the act of reifying them -- not necessarily as an "actor", but as some sort of split or doubleness in a players mentality -- which makes them cognitively easier to handle. Then we might go on by analyzing particular systems and styles of play in terms of these dualities, paradoxes and so on, which I think is the <i>really</i> important and <i>really</i> interesting task.<br/><br/>- Karl                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133540/#Comment_133540" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T22:32:55+00:00" title="March  8, 2008 10:32PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most important contribution this made to my understanding is that there are levels of virtuality.

Once we've got that idea, then we can talk about whether there's conflict between them, and how that relates to design intent and how the game is played.  We can also talk about personal desires vs. person-as-player desires vs. person-as-system-user desires vs. person-as-character desires, which are (a) much broader, and (b) related to design only tangentially.  <br/><br/>Until we've got the idea that goals can vary on different levels, there's no conversation.

This has led some to wholly reject the use of my-turn-to-say-something points in their game design, claiming that they could not possibly work. However, I think it's an empirical fact that they do work, and that we need to try to understand why, if the criticism is right, this is still the case. And here, once again, the actor comes along to help us. On my hypothesis, the solution to the mystery would simply be this: the player, when using my-turn-to-say-something points, simply constructs an actor which takes care of one aspect of the point use \u2014 either the "better story" or the "tactical advantage" aspect \u2014 while he takes care of the other aspect himself.<br/></blockquote>\nIn rereading this it occurred to me that you don't really need an actor in this case. You just need a player who can choose between these two uses of the currency. Even if the two goals are incommensurable, it is possible to decide which you value more at any particular time and to spend your resources accordingly. The value one places in power over story, on one hand, or tactical advantages, on the other, may be idiosyncratic, but that doesn't mean that the player is unable to prioritize these choices. I'm not sure why the player would need to construct an actor to avoid paradoxical goals in this instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133894/#Comment_133894" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T22:48:55+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 10:48PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2008 10:53PM by Burr.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm confusing myself here...<br><br>Let's say "the system" is the process that each player believes he or she is expected to follow by the group.

But it doesn't have to create the system to exist on the level of it. Rather, the actor, as I percieve it, exists on the level of the system and uses that system in an antagonistic mode.

Instead of "If it's not fun, it's not the way it's supposed to be played", I'd think of it more in the terms of "If it's not fun, it's not the way we want to play it". If the players want to have fun, and the game rules don't support this, they might create the actor to be able to play it in a fun way. If they don't want to have fun, I don't think this problem would appear.<br/><br/>This brings out an interesting idea: you design a game that's "broken", on purpose. But it's broken in a way that can be fixed in several ways. This would allow the play group to "fix" it in a way that's coherent with their preferred playing style. I'd say that the Roach works in this way, from a certain point of view. You can't always go for both the win and the good story.

What I've talked about is how that 'intended' way of playing is usually determined. Ie, it's usually determined by 'Hey, if it wasn't/if it wont be fun, then that isn't how it's intended to be played'. I'll quickly note again, there's no truth in that method of determination.\n<blockquote>This brings out an interesting idea: you design a game that's "broken", on purpose.

Hope it's something good to muse on. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134539/#Comment_134539" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T04:23:37+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  4:23AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I'm not seeing where the mention of unfun comes from. I'm saying people switch roles for the most fun, not because the other is unfun. You might pursue the gamist goal where your character is neutral on the subject, and pursue the character's goals to the detribute of gamist excellence the rest of the time, but you are having fun all the time. Where does the unfun come from?</blockquote>\nWell, any contrast can be used - unfun Vs fun, or average fun Vs the most fun. It doesn't have to be unfun, it can be 'If it's just average fun, that can't be intended - the most fun way of doing it must be the intended way of playing'. Read it through again replacing 'unfun' with 'average fun' and 'fun' with the 'most fun', it still says what I meant to get across.<br/><br/>Also that's in regards to playing it in the 'intended' way, as Karl's original post refered to. It's not in regards to people just openly changing the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
