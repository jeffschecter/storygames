Because stories are built from all those details. It's called Story Now, as opposed to (specifically) Story After the Fact. I don't rush past details because a story without details is not a story.<br/><br/><br/>Other than that, I don't know. Do you? If you do, can you tell me why? If you don't, but think it is true of Story Now, could you tell me why you think it?<br/><br/>Also, is this common belief, this rushing Story Now? I always have seen it as a sad outlier kind of thing -- not anything that had really taken hold in any real way. Did it?<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>* The Time I Rushed Story Now<br/><br/>Whenever I've seen people talking about rushing, it's always been someone illustrating how horrible Nar is because the GM for a game they played in rushed them from one nearly arbitrary ethical test to another. In other words, rushing is seen as a failure of fun, not an actual, valuable principle of Story Now play.<br/><br/>I think people, when trying something new, tend to focus on the new thing. And this has meant, on occasion, when people hear about the prioritization of issues that matter to the Players, the game is supposed to focus on that and that everything else is sort of an impediment to that.<br/><br/>But, for me, I've only seen it once in person: A game of In A Wicked Age at a con. None of us had played before. We were really intrigued with and focused on the conflict resolution system. We just rushed from one conflict to another. It was like story as WWE. But, you know, you're just supposed to play the game with lots of talking and world building and creating color -- and then, if a conflict occurs, you bring in the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342300/#Comment_342300" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T16:36:44+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  4:36PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a wide variety of games intended for Story Now, with a wide variety of players who prefer Story Now.  I'd say 90% of those sessions were fun for me.  I'd say 60% felt too rushed for my taste.  I'd say 20% felt so rushed that it almost made play not fun.<br/><br/>That last category is almost entirely con games.  Some were racing the clock, some felt like they were and finished an hour early.<br/><br/>Many of the players I met in these games were not interested in listening to me try to make my character's scenes more vivid (asking the GM about the room, delivering dialogue not aimed at instantly getting to a conflict).<br/><br/>In my 16-session Apocalypse World game, some players were interested in more vivid detail and others were not.

I think what this is about is color (in the strict Forge-ian use of the term): too little color makes a game uninteresting / feel rushed or artificial.<br/><br/>I have also seen the rushing, too little color thing happen in con games, but mostly applying the right amount of color is simply a matter of skillfulness (and also managing group preferences, of course).  Because here's the thing: even though it is by definition not a part of the game that interfaces with the mechanics, color contributions are pretty easy to divide\u2014for me at least\u2014between useful and not-useful.  What exactly constitutes usefulness of a bit of color varies from game to game of course, but basically the good kind of color is that which helps grow the players' interest in whatever the game's main thing is.  I'll be pretty aggressive about browbeating people if there's all sorts of shit going on that simply has nothing to do with the premise of the game or session, but I'm also (I think) pretty good about not simply rushing for rushing's sake (unless it's a con game).<br/><br/>The reason a) long in-character conversations and b) descriptive details of the gameworld or characters <i>sometimes</i> get short shrift in the S-G family of games is because they so easily <i>can</i> lead to meandering lame boringness.<br/><br/>I think those two elements of gameplay really are like the proverbial spice in the soup: too little or too much are both bad.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342333/#Comment_342333" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T20:28:34+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  8:28PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call, Matt!<br/>I've been operating under the assumption that the point of Sim play was exploring Color, Setting, System, and Character for their own sake.

In a Con Game, I tend to want to get past the introductory stuff and into the main action as quickly as possible. I don't want to get bogged down in details that may or may not come up during the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my mind, it's better to sketch out a world, and detail it where needed, rather than trying to define everything first and then playing with those details. I rely a lot on reincorporating details to give them heft, rather than having heft through an abundance of detail. This is a personal choice, but the games I play and run at Cons (PTA, Dungeon World, Fiasco)  facilitate the execution of this choice. From where I'm standing, there is a real phenoma being discussed here, although it stings a bit to see steamlined play framed as a negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll admit that I tend to be impatient in non-Con games, as well, often pushing hard to establish the central conflicts early, even if we still have several sessions left to go. This has a compression effect on play that often results in playing past the initial set-up of conflicting desires and into the fallout of those desires being acted upon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342369/#Comment_342369" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T06:34:37+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  6:34AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For reference, I prefer starting to play sooner rather than later in con games as well.

I can't listen to podcasts without wanting to speed up the speaker so they sound like Alvin the chipmunk because for me, lots of times, the normal pace of conversation is too damn slow.  In college I skipped most of my classes because listening to a professor simply speak the words that were already in the book was too damn slow.  When people post news clips on the internet I generally ignore the ones that are video or just read through the transcript because I can read about 3 pages of transcript in the time the speaker is still droning on in the first paragraph.<br/><br/>So when I role-play there is a definite limit to the amount of verbal description of details that aren't immediately relevant that I can tolerate without getting impatient.  My brain has already filled in most of the details about how things look, smell, and sound anyway, so unless the detail you're (generic you) introducing is either way cooler than the movie already running in my head...or is different from what's in my head in some way that's going to be important later...its not (usually) a value add to me.  The voice inside my head spends alot of time going "yeah, yeah, I get it, its creepy, move on".  Too much time spent describing the creepiness actually makes it feel LESS creepy to me.  So I suspect alot of things that might seem rushed to others, might seem comfortably paced to me...simply because 5 minutes of verbally described color takes about 5 seconds to internally imagine.<br/><br/>But point being...that's not because I don't like or enjoy the color...just that I have low tolerance for a large number of words being spoken at speeds far slower than my own imagination has already provided.  Many is the game for me where to an outside observer the game may seem all about attention to system or addressing premise with very little color.  But to me...there's TONS of color going on...its just mostly inside my head...and I've always assumed that a similar color rich movie is playing inside of each of the other player's heads too.  <br/><br/>In fact, that's pretty core to my assertion that the size of the non-shared imaginary space dwarfs the size of the shared imaginary space at the table.  It also means that I've learned to be more accepting of retroactively editing the color in my head to better fit with details that were in other players heads but not yet spoken...because given the choice between verbally outlining every detail so we're all on the same page vs. letting the majority of the details just happen in my head even if that means they don't exactly match what's in your head...I'd prefer the latter going back periodically to sync up when necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342374/#Comment_342374" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T06:57:59+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  6:57AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first <i>years</i> of puzzling out Forge games just from the text (as opposed to being part of the gaming culture) were like this.

I think we played 1st Quest a few years ago.  Any recollection on that game so long ago and this kind of thing?<br/><br/>Funny, I was playing a game of Legends of the Five Rings and we looked at the map and realized we would be passing a Daimyo's castle on our way somewhere and this guy was our hated enemy.  So, we sent messengers ahead, bought gifts and stopped by.  We had tea with our enemy and it was civil and so cool because your enemies are a show of status, a sign of how powerful you are.  You don't want your known rivals to be punks.<br/><br/>In the same game, the conclusion of the campaign ramped up at a brutal speed and I really wanted a moment to just chill before the big showdown went down.  I wanted a moment at the hot springs, sitting there with my samurai buddies, talking about the crazy shit we had faced and the big moment that was to come<br/><br/>So, that was the game that taught me to slow things down a bit.  I try to really pay attention to that kind of pacing with long-term games at home, like Burning Wheel and Apocalypse World because the games are set for a looong period of play and I feel like I have time to "have tea with the daimyo."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342404/#Comment_342404" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T12:28:07+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 12:28PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Data point-y thing.<br/><br/>I may have contributed to this perception in some games I have GM'd. One of the things I have come to enjoy about "new school" game design is that I, as GM, don't have to come to the table with tons and tons of color and setting already pre-planned and set up for the players to discover. I can sit back and ask questions and let it grow up from player input as and when needed.<br/><br/>I have noticed, with some groups, that this approach leads to hurried play. Players, used to looking to the GM for cues, see a lack of detail as a sign that there's nothing here that matters, and zip on by looking for the next set piece. Eventually, I deliver a set piece, since they seem to be floundering. Repeat.<br/><br/>I've gotten way better at prompting for input, and my regular players have in turn learned that just because I didn't describe something in detail doesn't mean they can't or shouldn't. But I expect that a game where the only places system engages are the big conflicts can feel empty and pointless if you're used to rolling for little things all the time, and I expect that a game where the GM doesn't have a lot of pre-planned content can look railroad-y if you're not seizing the initiative to fill that space with stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342410/#Comment_342410" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T12:42:47+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 12:42PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another data point...<br/><br/>I have liked Fiasco as a game, but I also felt like it was hurried because of the very limited economy of scenes.

ROLL DICE!"<br/><br/>It's a bit like the classic "system does matter" example of Vampire. In V:tM, you're supposed to be a scary vampire and do gothy stuff. But the rules for combat are huge and complicated, and you end up using them a lot.<br/><br/>In many Forge games, you're supposed to just chill and use the conflict rules when you have to. But at the same time, in many early games, those rules were the main focus of the rulebook. So yeah, we rushed toward conflict, like we used to rush toward combat in D&amp;D. There were rules for that! And they were meant to be used, obviously!</blockquote>\nSo its not just Story Now we are talking about, but all types of RPGs - how do you define a conflict for a particular game - when do you roll dice?

We packed like 3 sessions worth of action into 5 hours.  At the same time, yeah, not a whole lot of establishing environments or what things looked/sounded/smelled like.  Although, I vaguely remember that no one had a problem with me asking, "What does your character look like?  Is this a massive tea house or tiny private thing?"  There was also a lot of very good in-character dialogue, so resolving didn't feel preemptory.<br/><br/>On my personal spectrum, this game was quite rushed and fairly low color, but there were good reasons for both.  I'm happy to play that way from time to time as long as I get in some more slow-burn games too.<br/><br/>As my very first Story Now experience, I don't know how much that game has colored my perceptions going forward.  It certainly showed me some possibilities that I hadn't seen before.  That said, since then I've played multiple friggin' <i>campaigns</i> of Story Now, so I don't <i>think</i> my impressions are <i>too</i> biased...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342480/#Comment_342480" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T20:19:41+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  8:19PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2011 8:22PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd,<br/><br/>First Quest:<br/><br/>I don't recall feeling rushed by you.  I also don't recall knowing what any of the PCs and NPCs looked like.  The palace had a few cool details, and there were some well-described items.<br/><br/>Rob played that game at a pretty furious pace.  He pretty much made life dramatic and difficult for his character and everyone around her at every second he could.  It was awesome, but also a bit discombobulating for me.  "What?  Why are you doing that?  How have you survived this long?  Who are you?!"<br/><br/>Fred made up a lot of cool shit, facts about the world and history and how magic worked and that he could talk to ghosts and what they'd tell him.  He introduced a lot of content very quickly without a ton of sensory detail.  I loved his sense of how talking to ghosts worked, but I had little idea what it looked like because he kind of got right to the point.<br/><br/>Shane and I played it a little slower, kind of feeling our way into our characters and letting you prod us.<br/><br/>I remember needing to make some important-to-the-story decisions about what my character would do before I had developed him beyond my initial concept of "selfish, dishonorable coward who <i>might</i> try to do better".  It wasn't hard for me to make decisions for him, but it was a little hard for me to really care.  That changed by the end of the game, but it was a bit slower than usual for me.  Some early-game sipping tea with the enemy would have been nice.<br/><br/>So, overall, maybe a tiny bit rushed (due to Rob's approach), and all over the map on the color spectrum (brilliant touches, like the masks, but plenty of action in undefined environments as well).  I feel like the tone we were going for was a vaguely complex hybrid, not quite like any particular movie or comic I knew of, and more time or discussion on that point might have helped me envision stuff better.  I also remember being somewhat off for that game; bringing less to the table than I usually do.  I might have just run in from the bus or something.<br/><br/>Pardon the rambling.  I say very little of all this with any great confidence.  You could easily jog my memory with something that makes me go, "Oops, that's right, never mind."  I am curious to see how my impressions compare to yours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342486/#Comment_342486" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T20:49:59+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  8:49PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I describe something vividly in a game and then something mechanical happens because of it\u2014whether as clumsy as stunting in Exalted or as interesting as FoRKing in Burning Wheel et al.\u2014people don't remember it as color, they remember it as game-changing story-driving revelations.<br/><br/>When I describe something vividly in a game and nothing happens, as in D&amp;D4E, people remember is as color.

Not just the<i>events</i>of the movie, but<i>anything</i>about it that's important to you -- mood, details, theme songs, whatever.<br/><br/>Of course you can think faster than I can talk, but if you were gonna countenance delay for any reason, I'd hope it would be for another player's enthusiastic contribution to the fiction.<br/><br/>Am I making too many assumptions about the point of social roleplay?<br/><br/>Enthusiasm's almost always appreciated and infectious, and while I may have phrased it overly stridently I said this "so unless the detail you're (generic you) introducing is either way cooler than the movie already running in my head..." to acknowledge the contributions that get me excited too.<br/><br/>But I guess for me...there's a reason why so many movies can be shot in Toronto regardless of what city they're supposed to be...because at the end of the day, the kind of details that would allow a person to distinguish Toronto from  in any given scene...nobody (hardly anybody) really cares about enough to notice.  Those details just don't really matter...if they did there'd be a loud public hue and cry whenever the city in the movie isn't actually the city in the movie.  In other words, alot of the background scenery is so unimportant to the movie that it doesn't matter if its totally generic.  At the same time there are other movies where the imagery of the city is practically a character in itself.  <br/><br/>I guess that's my rambling way of pointing out that not all color detail is created equal and spending too much time on the not important kind is more boring than just skipping it altogether and moving on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342887/#Comment_342887" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T22:12:14+00:00" title="September 14, 2011 10:12PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2011 10:14PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.  Well, I'm sure we can agree that enthusiastic, unexpected, vivid, unique color is good and bland rambling about minutiae is bad.  Maybe we've just had different experiences along that spectrum.  I tend to assume that anyone who's contributing detail is <i>trying</i> to do the former, and I'm happy to allow that effort even if their success rate isn't exactly 100%.  I hope others approach my attempt to contribute color that way too.<br/><br/>That said, if I think way back, I <i>can</i> recall some tedious accounting of details from some GM who just went all OCD without really thinking about his audience, and yeah, fuck that guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>hurrying to get Story Now? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15066/hurrying-to-get-story-now/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="hurrying to get Story Now? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15066/hurrying-to-get-story-now/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="So, um, where are we, whose keeping track?

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd echo Judd and add not only misused or used well, but also different seasonings to different tastes.<br/><br/>Read a Hemmingway short story. Is it rushed? Read a passage of the fellowship traveling through the landscape of Middle-earth. Does he go on forever?<br/><br/>Raslph's points about the background elements of a TV or film are, I think, well taken. It's one of the things that gave me faith to built a crazy-ass show like "The Booth at the End" -- to know that if I put the focus on the faces of the actors <i>only</i>, the show would still work as long as the actors themselves were interesting. On the other hand, some people hate (HATE!) the show because "nothing is happening" and "We never leave the booth!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I loved what Terrance Malick does in his work (see: "The Tree of Life") where it is ALL about focusing on the details and reams and reams of visual detail and description, if you will. I love it. Other people hate it.<br/><br/><br/>So all of this can't come down to h<i>ow much</i> description is offered. It has to be a matter of how it's done, to what effect it's done, and whether the audience (the players at the table) like it.<br/><br/>Keeping in mind that, "Nothing ever made was liked by everybody," we know that some people gathered at the table might like or not like what is being "made." And this is a huge subject. At the level being discussed.<br/><br/>So, here's where I am: <br/><br/>1) When Dave opens with, "People who play Story Now don't care about description or <i>can't do it</i>" -- well, it's an idiocy. Because all people <i>can</i> do it. They're people. They can do it. It might be that it might not be a priority in their play. It might not be what turns them on, they're turning "the camera" elsewhere or whatever. This is where we have to place, say Hemmingway and Kurt Vonnegut side-by-side and say either "One of these guys is wrong," or "Oh, I guess there's many ways of telling a story."<br/><br/>2) But... if pepole doing something because they think they're <i>supposed</i> to do it a certain way at the expense of what would bring them pleasure or other people pleasure, then that's sad. They might only be trying it out and experimenting with new techniques or ways of communicating narrative at the table (which is more than understandable). But if they're honestly not getting pleasure and don't stop and change they're ways because they think some book told them to do things in a way that makes them not have a good time... well, I'd call that sad. This doesn't mean throwing out the baby with the bathwater. All of Todd's quotes from books above can be tossed to extreme ends where they make the storytelling so chaotic and sparse you don't even know what's going on. I know this is the Internet and all, but in life we of course don't have to live at either one extreme or another.<br/><br/>3) Ralph's points about wanting to keep his own movie in his head... This is a third and separate subject (if only because Ralph has tatted it as a social comfort issue). This, too, has to be a made of scale... because clearly we're setting up some descriptions -- or we don't know what the heck we're sharing. My own guess is that I'm a more description guy than Ralph. In my view, we're here to <i>share</i> our imaginations with each other. I don't want to be imagining alone together. On the other hand, just like reading a book, each reader can only take and build his own images of things. There's no way -- ever -- to build the precise "We're on the same page on ever detail." People manage to see real life as different things! But, again, this seems to be "How much does one want to share?" and "Don't screw up my movie!" rather than the table trying to find it's sea level on aesthetics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342962/#Comment_342962" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T14:58:45+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  2:58PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can think of many Narr techniques which encourage a brisk game, and few which encourage lingering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342966/#Comment_342966" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T15:36:36+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  3:36PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm saying you're in charge of the gas pedal and the brake.

I can answer regarding my comments about Fiasco.  My four times playing Fiasco have generally felt rushed, because I felt like given only 4 scenes per player, I couldn't put in a non-plot-advancing scene and still have issues go through a complete arc.  I still had a good time, but I felt like it could have been better.  I played this way because these days I try to play a game exactly as written a number of times before moving on to a modified/hacked/house-ruled version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342976/#Comment_342976" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T16:13:29+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  4:13PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2011 4:17PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>I paraphrased you. I don't think I missed the gist of the quote at all. In another thread you wrote: "Nar games attract players who either suck at color or aren't interested in it?"<br/><br/>The fact that you follow it up with the words,"Just a suspicion, based mostly on cons" or what you wrote in post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2315&amp;Mode=like">#15</a> above doesn't particularly interest me. It's no different, as far as I'm concerned, than Michelle Bachman's fact free floating of whatever theory happens to have entered her head at that moment -- which always gets the cover of, "I don't know, that's an interesting question, we should consider whether Obama is a secret Socialist Islamist out to destroy the United States. I really don't know. But maybe we should think about that."<br/><br/>You might not like I don't care about the fact I'm blowing by your awkward buffering, but don't tell me I misquoted you. No one can read your question and think I said anything you didn't say.<br/><br/><br/>But you want your weird observation to be a question. So, I'll answer your question:<br/><br/>"No." The answer is, "No." Do Story Nows games attract players who either suck at color or aren't interested in it? "Nope. They don't."<br/><br/>If you're not making a statement or useless assumptions but really looking for answers, are you willing to saying, "Okay thanks. I was curious about that. Thank goodness that's resolved. We can move on now."<br/><br/>I mean that seriously. I have answered your question. Do you accept my answer?

Perhaps my phrasing makes the question mark seem superfluous, but that was not my intent.  <br/><br/>Your misquote takes what you assumed I meant and makes it literal (people who do Story Now do X).  What I literally said (Story Now might attract people who do X) is extremely different in that it doesn't <i>have</i> to be taken the way you took it (which is, in fact, <i>not</i> how I meant it, and I think Remi and Judd got that).<br/><br/>If I've given you a years-long Michelle Bachman-like history of bullshit, then sure, distrust everything I say.  Otherwise, please try not to do that, and when I come back to clarify what I mean, take the clarification as a more accurate presentation of my actual position than the first thing I said.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>I am happy to hear your answer to my question, and I absolutely believe you that it speaks to your experience.  I too have had high-color Story Now play; just not as consistently as you have.  <br/><br/>I don't think either of us, or anyone else, is capable of <i>resolving</i> whether there's any correlation in preference between Story Now and fast-pace/low-color.  But your data point definitely tilts the likelihood further away from that as far as I'm concerned.  <br/><br/>I knew I wasn't the <i>only</i> one who enjoyed Story Now and cared a lot about color.  I just didn't know how numerous we are.  Finding a brother in taste is always nice!

I think the Narr games we played accomodated my preferences more easily than his.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite><br/>This whole conversation seems to me to be grounded in people not wanting to take responsibility for their own preferences.</blockquote>\nI don't see that.<br/><br/>I think Dave is owning that his preferences are a little out of sync with a prevailing Narr mode; and he's looking for ways to reconcile the two-- by finding or inventing techniques which WILL help him do so.<br/><br/>I think that some people here tried to explain-away his observation, as if acknowledging the reality of his observations would harm the sacred sanctity of Storynowism, or sumdamnthing.<br/><br/>In my first post, I tried to add weight to Dave's observations, by confirming the issues are real, and that I'm part of the 'problem'.<br/><br/><br/>(BTW, I am also interested in learning to play more like Dave. To broaden my range.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342981/#Comment_342981" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T16:54:45+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  4:54PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2011 4:55PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>I think the Narr games we played accomodated my preferences more easily than his.</blockquote>Maybe!

I tried a driving analogy for how Ingenero is supposed to work - players formally set goals, big or small, and when the character is advancing closely on a goal, the game switches emphasis from narrating decisions and consequences to using conflict resolution rules for resolving the goal.  In other words it slows down to linger on the things that are important to each character.<br/><br/>Ingenero is the vehicle, and the players are the driver. <br/>The GM is the open, unwinding road. <br/>Character decisions are the steering. <br/><b>Character goals are the accelerator and brakes. </b><br/>Reward points are the fuel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342986/#Comment_342986" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T17:56:13+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  5:56PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And my point is this:<br/>"Prevailing" habits of lack of color with story now play?<br/>I don't see it.<br/>As for Dave's question - my answer simply blows up the premise. <br/>Is there some innate connection between Story Now player and lack of interest in color?

That must be very clear to expert roleplayers and GMs.  But for the inexperienced, controlling the 'speed' of the game, or the focus.. when to concentrate on this or that, etc... (pacing I suppose)  Its can be seemingly out of control or maybe not even considered as a controllable variable.  I remember my first couple of PTA games were all about finding the conflict and getting to the conflict, and fuck it was hard, confusing work.  Everyone at the table felt like they were flailing around, thrashing to get to a conflict, and either rushing there, or trying to rush there and failing and ending up with dud scenes.<br/><br/>Its not like we wanted to, its just that we lacked the ability to do anything else and the rules just seemingly screamed FIND AN ISSUE AND MAKE A CONFLICT OUT OF IT RIGHT NOW!!! without offering much support to do that (that we could understand at the time, anyway).<br/><br/>And the opposite (not common in indie games that I have played) is  the groups that seem to concentrate on every little thing so that it takes ages for anything significant to actually ocur.  I think thats also a symptom of having no clue about pacing, and absolutely no support from the game to help with pacing (not even "get to the conflict, stupid").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342990/#Comment_342990" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T18:15:29+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  6:15PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If ya want, Steve, you could always throw <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> down on the table to foster awareness/communication...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342993/#Comment_342993" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T18:31:07+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  6:31PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2011 6:31PM by stefoid.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>If ya want, Steve, you could always throw<a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>down on the table to foster awareness/communication...</blockquote>\nThat could help communicate your wishes for sure.<br/><br/>but what if I dont know what my wishes are?

(It's even happened once or twice with S-G darlings.)<br/><br/>I don't think, in retrospect, that the real problem (for me) was "too much color," or that I learned to hate people like Dave Berg* who like there to be a fair amount of description.  It's that there is a lot of back and forth on details that aren't precisely color, in that they are things that seem like they have a significant mechanical impact but then don't end up meaning much.  "We go there."  "There's a guy."  "We ask him about That Thing."  "He tells you some minor, uncertain detail about That Thing."  Lather, rinse, repeat, in infinite but tedious variation.  Note that the guy or the place may actually be described in an interesting way, or they may not.  And the conversation may not drag on, but the point is that it's not <i>useful</i>, not because it's un-engaging, I mean, the GM may do a really funny voice for the NPC or something, but because it doesn't (drumroll please) <i>drive the game towards conflict</i>: it doesn't make our mission any more urgent, it doesn't suggest a definite course of action, it doesn't piss us off, etc.<br/><br/>I've both seen and participated in some long in-game conversations that were interesting!  But they were interesting because they were reflecting on some awesome and complicated shit that had actually happened (that was more than just talking), and lead to a serious consideration of what the next non-talky phase of the game would consist of (in-character).<br/><br/>A game that is all or nearly-all in-character talking is actually just as low color as a "shock: social science fiction" game where you rush from conflict to conflict.  Though I get that sometimes S-G play can be both low-color and low-dialogue, and that's bad.<br/><br/>Talking in-character because there's nothing else going on in the game is just so utterly different than talking in-character about something meaningful.  In-game time pressure is nearly always a good thing in games, even if out-of-game time pressure can kill all sorts of things.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*I only hate Dave Berg because he moved to North Carolina!!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343008/#Comment_343008" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T20:36:30+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  8:36PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2011 9:09PM by Todd_L.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don' t like the tone of posts like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2352&amp;Mode=like">#52</a> and #65: "Nothing to see here folks, move along now."<br/><br/>I feel there's a lot of 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' denial going on.<br/>An anxious desire to see this line of inquiry end, pronto.<br/><br/>Which is ironic, coming from people who profess to enjoy Addressing Premise, at length, in detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343010/#Comment_343010" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T20:41:53+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  8:41PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Talking in-character because there's nothing else going on in the game is just so utterly different than talking in-character about something meaningful.

What?<br/><br/>Since that would be me, you could address me by name.<br/><br/>And that's the weirdest piece of shit I've seen floated in a bunch of threads with lots of weird shit lately.<br/><br/>"Denial"?<br/><br/>Here's the denail:<br/><br/>People thinking the games -- the rules, the techniques, the whatever -- are going to take away the responsibility of thinking through what they want, the trial-and-error of how to get it, and the work of communicating that to fellow players at the table -- are somehow going to do the work of making creative or smart choices <i>for them</i>.<br/><br/>When people say things "Well, in Story Now play these are thing kinds of things that happen, these are the kind of things people do to rush things along" and I know for a fact that while those things <i>can</i> happen, they don't <i>have to</i> happen, or don't happen at all in many sessions, I know that these generalizations are bullshit. <br/><br/>Now listen: I've seen the behaviors mentioned happen. If we're rushing past the color and just jumping to conflicts, it blows past my fun of making stories socially. So I made changes at the table in my behavior to alter my actions and the actions of my fellow players at the table, But this isn't about the techniques or practices written in the books. It's about being accountable for judging what is and isn't working and saying, "Well, what about <i>this</i>..." and trying something new. It's about experience and responsibility about how you'll behave and who you'll spend time with.<br/><br/>My brother recently referred to my "radical belief in our responsibility for what we say and do." Trust me, I'm all about going all the way in. But what I won't tolerate is a bunch of people complaining that a bunch of people they've never met are mind-controlling them via text in a RPG rule-book into how their speaking to their friends at a gaming table.<br/><br/>Look at my post again. You'll find this:<br/><br/>"Now people know if they want more color and they're not getting it, or they want to go slower and the game's going too cast - it's up to them to bring the change to the table or find the table that wants that."<br/><br/>There's no "professing" going on. I'm saying it. I'm saying something harsh and seldom spoken. (Jesse Burneko is one of the few -- with his acknowledgment that this stuff -- <i>story</i> stuff -- takes practice.) <br/><br/>My post above is about taking the pure responsibility for what we say and do. Either people are going to accept that or they won't. See, I'm not seeing the crime of the scene in the texts or the advice -- often <i>damned</i> good advice -- about how to create and move stories along in <i>Fiasco</i> or <i>Primetime Adventures</i>. I'm seeing the crime of the scene in people aren't willing to assume the that they, and no one else, are responsible -- completely and totally -- for what happens at the game table.<br/><br/>I'm trying to open a new line of inquiry. Where people take responsibility for what their play is like.<br/><br/><br/>With that said, you want to explain to me what the evil is I'm trying to get people to ignore, what line of inquiry I'm trying to shut down, fine.

Some things are subtle and hard.  Pacing and rhythm are probably two of the most subtle and difficult skills to learn as a GM, as a player and as a table.  It's particularly hard as a table, because you often need a social consistency that doesn't always exist.<br/><br/>I do think, though, that this realization supports Christopher Kubasik's point.  It's not up to the text.  It's actually not possible for the text, to drive improvements in this area.  Sure there can be guidelines based on the kind of game you are playing. But ultimately, we as players need to find the pacing and rhythm that works for us in any given game.<br/><br/>Wax on, wax off, Daniel-san.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343054/#Comment_343054" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-16T10:46:48+00:00" title="September 16, 2011 10:46AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2011 10:54AM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>If ya want, Steve, you could always throw<a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>down on the table to foster awareness/communication...</blockquote>\nDoesn't help. One of my players is color blind. Pretty massively so. Not quite "a dog sees black and white" type, but close enough. Like he can't drive cause he really can't tell the red and green traffic lights apart (which are really piss-poor design if you think about it. Red/Green color blindness far and away the most common type).<br/><br/>It's sad, too, cause I've always wanted to play WizKids clicky dial games with him. But he basically just can't. They rely too much on color coding things that aren't otherwise glossed. Hell, even I have a hard time telling the red squares from the orange ones sometimes, and the yellow is really hard to see in less than perfect lighting conditions.<br/><br/>The upside is that having him as one of my closest gaming buddies makes me think about color blindness when considering game design choices.<br/><br/>I know that's a side track, but I thought I'd mention it.

My thoughts are: <br/><br/>(1) The rule system and/or mechanics used can have a huge effect on the pacing and rhythm of the game.  Fiasco, say, has a very different pace from Burning Wheel.  <br/><br/>However, <br/>(2) The GM and players are responsible for the rules and/or mechanics that they use.  <br/><br/>Therefore,<br/>(3) One can be correct in both of (a) criticizing the game for problems, and (b) criticizing the players for not adjusting the game to be fun for them.<br/><br/>So suppose some people try game X and find that the pace is too fast for them, and they aren't having as much fun as they would like.  It could well be that they aren't very skillful at handling pacing, and don't know the right techniques to adjust play to their ideal.  I think they're correct in pointing out that the game has the tendency for fast pacing - like Fiasco, say.  <br/><br/>Although not specifically about pacing, I have often seen people complain about not having fun due to the tendencies of D&amp;D or other traditional tabletop RPGs.  Despite this, I've seen many people have fun games of very deep, nuanced, character-driven play in all sorts of traditional games - often by modifying the typical pattern of adventures and/or changing the rules.  They are responsible for their own play, but that doesn't mean that the characterizations of these games as written aren't correct.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343074/#Comment_343074" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-16T16:24:30+00:00" title="September 16, 2011  4:24PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>what I won't tolerate is a bunch of people complaining that <span style="color: #FF0033;">a bunch of people they've never met are mind-controlling them</span> via text in a RPG rule-book into how their speaking to their friends at a gaming table.</blockquote>\n<br/>That's not true.<br/><br/><br/>I certainly <span style="color: #FF0033;">have</span> met all the people who are mind-controlling me via text in RPG rule-books.<br/><br/>They are a cult of self-proclaimed "Narrativist" hippies, adherents to something called the Lumpley Principle, which stated-simply, means "Game Design Is Mind Control".

Part of the idea of the GNS classification is that, for Narrativist play, story is a top priority.  We don't get it whenever it comes, we go after it,<i>now</i>.<br/><br/>Does that mean we have to rush through scenes, summarizing everything, churning out big events and decisions, without bothering with detail and immersion and experience?<br/><br/>Even if we don't<i>have</i>to, do we do it anyway?<br/><br/>Why or why not?</blockquote>\nFor me it's been the opposite. I spend a lot more time on details and immersion when playing Narrativist rpgs than more Gamist rpgs. With the latter I find the focus is on getting to the next challenge, while while the former details and immersion and experience are more important because they are a huge part of story. I'm a little confused by the idea of rushing past those elements to get to the story, because those elements ARE the story.<br/><br/>The tendency to slow down rather than rush in Narrativist games is one that has been supported by a lot of rules and advice in those games. Right now, I'm running Apocalypse World, and I've noticed that although my natural tendency is to rush to action scenes, a lot of the guidance to the MC encourages me to slow things down and flesh the setting out more. I'm supposed to name all the NPCs, to make the world seem real, to ask questions like crazy, to "barf forth" details that flesh out the setting. I also noticed that the rules prompt myself and the players to flesh things out, like when reading a person means I need to flesh out an aspect of a character I hadn't thought about before. Maybe other games are different, but I'm surprised to hear other people saying they feel rushed by these kinds of games, since I find they do a lot to make me slow down and flesh things out more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343083/#Comment_343083" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-16T18:27:05+00:00" title="September 16, 2011  6:27PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Todd, I know you realize that the internet makes it hard to tell when you're being hysterically funny and when you're being a douche.</blockquote>\nWhy are they mutually exclusive?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343084/#Comment_343084" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-16T18:42:27+00:00" title="September 16, 2011  6:42PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Todd, I know you realize that the internet makes it hard to tell when you're being hysterically funny and when you're being a douche.</blockquote>\nI'm going to go with hysterically funny -- because I laughed and was happy upon reading the post. <br/>That was awesome.

The first is where all the players create an image together of what's happening.  Who's there?  What does the scene look like?  What are people talking about?  The second part is determining what the important characters want, and whether or not they succeed at getting what they want.

They were Heart and Mistaken for each other. Several times, they got stuck into that "circular argument" thing where person A says something in character to B's character, then B replies in character, then A replies but doesn't really move things on, then B replies but doesn't really move things on, and so on. It's more like each person trying to get the last word in than really trying to move events on. The two people were playing in character, and having fun, but would happily have spent lots of time in the same inconsequential in-character discussion.<br/><br/>I had to intervene a few times to get them to say what the outcome of the conversation was, what happened to the Heart as a result of it, and to bring in the Key Phrases. When I did, things moved on again.<br/><br/>So, I think the "push to conflict" type advice is something akin to training wheels. If you don't know how to play in the "story games" style (especially if you're used to trad RPGs?) perhaps you need the push to make the conversations meaningful and drive the story forward. Once you're comfortable with doing that, you can take your time over the conversations and colour, knowing full well that whatever you're doing is actually contributing to moving the game forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343512/#Comment_343512" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T13:56:42+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  1:56PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neil,<br/>We should take a page from ApocaWorld and think about how we can show what it means to push to conflict - kind of unpack the component tasks.<br/><br/>1) We need to have the potential for a conflict of interest in the situation. <br/>2) That conflict may involve the players directly opposing each other.

There was absolutely nothing they could do about it, but they were all immersed and reacting in-character, and there was a lot of yelling about the moral and strategic ramifications.  It was a huge highlight of the session.  The predicament seemed so real that skipping over any part of exploring it -- in any direction, consequential or no -- would have been a tragedy.<br/><br/>In a game where character change is largely about your position in the world, this random argument was better than 1000 XP.  You align yourself on one side or the other of the game's core topics -- magic, daemonology, corruption, power, achievement and teamwork.  Who cares if anything <i>happens now</i> based on that?  <i>Everything</i> that happens <i>later</i> will be based on it in some way.<br/><br/>Not that I'm disagreeing with you, Matt.  Hard to make that fun for the whole group in a con one-shot.<br/><br/>I wonder if perhaps the most <i>particularly</i> problematic kind of in-character discussion is discussion that <i>tries and fails</i> to be consequential.  If you came into the duke's parlor to chat, and you just chat, that might be fine.

(How's North Carolina, Dave?) (Also, I played Small Worlds once, and was similarly lost in the game, not sure what to do until the game was over.)<br/><br/>I think that there are a lot of things coming together here, and I've been on both sides of this issue before.<br/><br/>In no particular order:<br/><br/>1. I do NOT think that indie game design mandates or forces fast, jerky play with no descriptive detail. Most of the "darling" games of this community can be played very functionally at a nice and slow pace, without deviating from any of the rules or advice in the book(s). For instance, I do not see any reason why a game of The Shadow of Yesterday would normally run slower than a game of D&amp;D, or vice-versa.*<br/><br/>[ * A significant exception being the speed of combat: some games will make particular procedures very lengthy and/or involved -- like the more recent editions of D&amp;D, for instance. But I'm speaking more of the speed of the fiction here: if that confuses you, imagine I'm just talking about low-level AD&amp;D 2nd Edition.]<br/><br/>I've often argued with people about this: "Why are you complaining that your Sorcerer [or whatever] game moves too fast and doesn't have enough detail? If you like detail, put it in; if you like a slow pace, slow down." So, I'm totally with Christopher on this one. Play it as you like, right? It makes no sense to blame the book for telling you to remember to have conflict in the story.<br/><br/>2. I DO think that game design affects the pace of the story and the game very significantly. Some games allow you to move through chunks of story really, really fast, and some block you every step of the way. For example: in D&amp;D, a monster who has 500 hit points and immunity to instant kill magics, etc, generally cannot simply be killed in a quick 5-minute scene. Likewise, you want to become the Emperor of the Great Lands, well, you're starting at 1st level. It's going to take you at least a little while, right?<br/><br/>Game design also affects the *optimal* speed of gameplay. Like John Kim points out, if you play Fiasco with long meandering scenes and lots of exposition... you won't get anywhere by the end of the session. On the other hand, if you try to throw a D&amp;D game into a final confrontation to save the universe from the Big Bad within the first five minutes... you'll have difficulties, because the game is designed to expect a certain rate of character development, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Each game has somewhat of an optimal story pace, or at least an optimal range for the pace of the story. I know that when I play game X, I need to push certain elements forward, or it will be rough going. I also know that when I play game Y, it's not as much fun unless we consciously slow down and get into the details somewhat more. Some games are pretty flexible in this regard; other games really have a "sweet spot" in the pace at which they move.<br/><br/>3. Story Games/Forge games/indie games, and this whole movement of gaming, has a very particularly place in the history of games, at least for the people who began the movement and their own personal experiences. I think the Forge was dominated early on by a whole group of people who were, among other things:<br/><br/>* Getting older and developing more mature, defined tastes<br/>* Getting older and finding that they had less and less free time<br/>* Getting older and becoming more demanding about the quality of their gaming<br/>* Growing more and more frustrated when games didn't deliver what they were looking for<br/><br/>So, many people in this crowd were very consciously pushing for faster, more meaningful play, with more drama, more conflicts, etc. Hence that association with "Story Now!"<br/><br/>I identify with this: one of the things that attracted me to "indie games" was the promise that, hey, we're not going to waste four hours on insignificant details, because the design of the game will help us get on the same page about what we're into and really focus in on it.<br/><br/>I remember a lot of talk along these lines, both at the Forge and among people discovering those games, and (in my experience), a LOT of went something like:<br/><br/>"Dude! I'm sick of how slow and bogged-down our games are. Have you heard about [Game X]? It says to Say Yes or Roll the Dice! Doesn't that sound like it could solve that problem?"<br/><br/>So, at the very least, some significant minority of the whole group of people involved with these new games was very consciously trying to get their games to move faster, to deliver more drama and more punch in a shorter period of time. <br/><br/>Myself? I love the idea of a slow-burn, high-detail game. However, I get to play a story game once in a blue moon, and usually only for a few hours. So I gravitate towards games that can provide "the good stuff" in a short period of time, and reliably.<br/><br/>Lifestyle may be a significant factor here. Dave, from what little I know of our respective lifestyles, you tend to have more opportunities to explore slow-moving, detailed games than I do. That alone might be enough to describe differences in many people's stated preferences.<br/><br/>4. Everything is best in moderation. Or something like that:<br/><br/>That whole mindset of "indie games design" drove a lot of people to push games faster. They saw games moving real slow, so they designed games, bought games, or offered advice that helped things move along faster. This was a new thing for a lot of people, and very welcome.<br/><br/>I'm sure at some level this selected for people who wanted that, who prefer a faster pace. <br/><br/>If you like fast-paced drama, are you going to buy the latest super-detailed combat sim, or a game that you can sit down and play right away and get to what you want?<br/><br/>So, I think a lot of story game design was driven by or for people who wanted a faster pace.<br/><br/>Now, we've had a reaction to that. In the last few years, people have started talking about: "How can we make our games *slow down*?" "I miss the detail..." Etc.<br/><br/>Vincent has said many times that one of his goals in the design of Apocalypse World was to get people to slow down and focus more on the details of play. That kind of design is a reaction to games moving along too quickly, just like many of the earlier "story games" were designed in reaction to people not getting the drama they wanted fast enough.<br/><br/>Many people are interested and are (or were) exploring design elements like TSOY's "refreshment scenes", which are also about slowing down the progression of story by creating moments and scenes which are conflict-free.<br/><br/>As niches get filled, new interests pop up, often in reaction to what needs have not been met or what territory has not been explored. I think that's cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15066/hurrying-to-get-story-now" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15066/hurrying-to-get-story-now" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15066/hurrying-to-get-story-now/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15066/hurrying-to-get-story-now/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15066/hurrying-to-get-story-now/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15066%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15066%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>hurrying to get Story Now? - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15066/hurrying-to-get-story-now/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="hurrying to get Story Now? - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15066/hurrying-to-get-story-now/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content='To finish my miniature novel: * I remember the first few times I played "story games" with "indie gamers".

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To finish my miniature novel:<br/><br/>* I remember the first few times I played "story games" with "indie gamers". I was totally shocked at the pacing of the story: "Wow, this is fast!" I enjoyed it, but, yes, I've played with people whose preference for moving things along was way too strong for my tastes. I still had a good time, but that kind of pace left me short of breath and hoping to slow down next time and enjoy the scenery.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem like a terribly controversial hypothesis to me to say that people who DO like a fast pace and DO NOT like detail/color a great deal might be drawn more often to "Story Now" design, as Dave suggests. I don't know if it's true, but if it were, it would not surprise me in the least: it sounds like a pretty natural possibility.<br/><br/><br/>Also, a sidenote:<br/><br/>What I find fascinating about all this is that detail and color do not necessarily line up with the pace of the story OR the intensity of the story.<br/><br/>For instance, consider that you could play out a long long long combat in AD&amp;D 2nd Ed. without really knowing anything about detail or color. It is (at least potentially) just SLOW.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I find Dogs in the Vineyard to be a very slow-moving game. You can play for several hours and only play through a couple of scenes. However, the design of the game gives a lot of intensity to that gameplay: we have lots of detail about what's happening and what is being said, and it is clearly all pushing things forward, all the time. We might have little color, though, and a very slow pace of story development (a single conflict could take an hour to resolve). Something like old-school D&amp;D might be the opposite: we have tons and tons of detail and color, as people ask "how thick is the rope?" and "does it seem like my gloves would slide over this rope very easily?"... but then the actual conflict might be resolved with a single roll, once all those details are established.<br/><br/>If I was one of those matrix-making people, I'd probably do a blog post about all the different permutations of "high color", "fast story pace", "slow story pace", "drawn-out conflict resolution", "rapid conflict resolution", "rapid mechanical resolution", "lengthy mechanical resolution", and "detailed fictional accounting"... and then give a cool-sounding name to each space in the matrix, of course, and list all the games I think fall under that category. And then we could all argue about it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343616/#Comment_343616" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-22T13:11:15+00:00" title="September 22, 2011  1:11PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved reading that analysis, Paul.
