Finally, I managed to get a playtest of my own newish game, Ensemble, with Mike Holmes that's helping me polish it up, even if it means shooting one of my Sacred Chaos in the meantime (well, more like surgically extracting it for a different game).<br/><br/>Look for Tony's posts about "Dan Helsing."

Not wanting to speak to the quality of the play (I'll leave that for others less biased), I can say that the feedback that I recieved from those participating was excellent, and I think will go a long way to resolving some issues that the game has. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also participated in a test of Jessica Hammer's game, The Weaver's Daughter. It was interesting, but the big lesson we learned is that somebody has to really have read the game over well, and understand it before playing. As it was, everybody was a bit confused about how the three sorts of magic worked exactly. I'm certain that there's a great idea there... unfortunately I just didn't get to experience it really. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe text could do with more explicit step-by-step procedures. But, then, I'm always for the very dry textbook presentation, and many or most will disagree with me. There has to be some compromise, however. A character creation checklist somewhere, for example. Note that I didn't read it... this is just from the confusion that John Kim seemed to be experiencing running the game, and glancing at the text. Even Em, who seemed to be otherwise the most familiar with the game, couldn't figure some of the stuff out. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlexander mentioned the Ensemble playtest, and I gave him a lot of direct feedback. The actual play was quite entertaining. At first, sitting down after they'd already started and had already decided to play crows in a Walmart parking lot, I was apprehensive - didn't sound like my cup of tea. But somehow working in my character and such, I got hooked in. Not sure if that was caused by the system, or just because it's easy to get hooked into any game being played by Jason Morningstar and other such entertaining players. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think we can credit the system somewhat. My main complaint with the system is that I couldn't hold on to all of the various rules and how they interacted - not because they were overly complex, but because they all seemed to be sorta added on and not inter-related. At least not in any way easy to discern (there may well be something really smart to it, but just so opaque as to be hard to recall). <br/>\n<br/>\nAm I forgetting anyone? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88869/#Comment_88869" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T07:29:57+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  7:29AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don's "Artesia Tales," a storygame-style hack of Mark Smylie's Origins-winning semi-traditionalist indie game, is super-hot.

This game has all the promise of a really enjoyable game-night-style story-game. (Jonathan says he's got a framework for ongoing play, but I just can't see myself doing it; I'd rather run a series of one-shots given the tone and subject matter.)<br/><br/>Chargen is quick and fun. I played Hartford A. Spronge, PhD, a "world-reknowned botanist" with 2D black orchid extract and 1D pruning shears. Each character has a hidden talent (Spronge: "I know voodoo!") <b>or</b> a dark secret. If you choose the latter, that means you're actually on the side of the monster. The other characters were (IIRC): an aristocrat in search of a native wife, his aboriginal spirit-guide, the ship's captain/owner, his son, and a photojournalist for National Geographic. 1930s: Our crew landed on the beach of a deserted Monster-Island-style island, which (we soon came to learn) was infested with a vast network of mind-controlling plants. From the start of play, each encounter with the "monster" yields a new quality or improvement of an existing quality. Ours ended up with (IIRC): networked plants, mind control, people puppets, gaping maw, and queen. The game uses a location-based style "board" created during play on a series of index cards. Our locations were (IIRC): the Beach, the Underground Installation, the Jungle, the Cave, the Tunnels, the Deserted Village, and the Clearing (where the queen lived, natch). There are also objects, represented by dice, scattered throughout the locations that are defined during play. Our objects included (IIRC): tanks of fungicide with sprayer, a large truck, a personal submarine, and "secret information" about the plants scrawled by natives on the cave walls.<br/><br/>My character met his bloody thusly: He hooked the fungicide tanks up to the truck and drove it into the queen's gaping maw Dr.-Strangelove-style. The father was secretly working for the plants, and leveled his flare gun to destroy the landing craft; his son went to stop him; the gun went off and burned them both to death. And the photojournalist escaped in the personal submarine in the underground installation, with a final shot of a wriggling plant tentacle stuck to the hull....<br/><br/>Long story short, it's very fun, owing in no small part to its quick pace and nice fiddly bits. I think Jonathan got a lot of help from our group. He's working out a few more "conditions" and some method of balancing how many/which players have dark secrets and are, consequently, working in service of the monster. He'll need some clearer guidance on who narrates what. All in all, I'm very much looking forward to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88887/#Comment_88887" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T09:39:19+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  9:39AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whew!

A rollicking good time compared to any game, but leaps and bounds beyond anything I would have expected using a mechanic similiar to Gin Rummy.<br/><br/>The next night Juddson ran a playtest of Poison'd, which was pretty cool.  I'm not sure if I'm sold on it, partly because it seems like you do have to "build" your character a certain way, with knowledge of the rules, in order to get maximum enjoyment.  However, it did drive us to be horrible Pirates - abusing our sailors, threatening to mutilate our comrades (in this case - me), and raping and sodomizing our prisoners.  A magical thing.<br/><br/>Oh, I also played in a demo of Paul Tevis's <i>Penny For My Thoughts</i>, which was beautifully constructed to create story arcs for each character as you uncover past memories.  A nice bridge between improv acting and roleplaying games.  One of several things I'm kicking myself that I didn't get a chance to return to pick up.  Paul: I'll be getting in touch with you about it, just you wait!<br/><br/>Oh, and I mustn't forget, after demanding Mr. Holmes treat me to an Otherworld playtest, I got to do that, and now I can't wait until I can buy a copy.

Still, a great, great game.<br/><br/>I also playtested an Anime series game that has a lot of potential.<br/><br/>Edit: fixed spelling and claified a point                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89268/#Comment_89268" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T16:58:27+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  4:58PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tenra Bansho.

We each got a pre-gen which we customized with 2 more Aspects, and then proceeded to totally own those characters as if they'd been ours all along. The game was super fun, playing with all the stereotypes of Vegas amped up to 11, until things broke down. Then we had awesome - part II, when we sat there for about an hour and a half dissecting the play we got in, the scenario, the mechanics we had added/tweaked specifically for VAM, and talking about the craft of being a story-games GM.

Dungeons are created using playing cards and the resolution mechanic is like Sorcerer but with cards rather than dice. Anyway, this game is almost complete and I didn't find any holes in it. The lack of group XP promotes just the right sort of bitchiness between the warriors, rogues and wizards in the party. I also love the zero prep and easy generation of magic items and simple levelling up. Thumbs up.<br/><br/>I got 3:16 (or Three Sixteen) sorted in some really solid discussion after hours too. No playtests but I think the game basics are now done, it just needs playtesting to find the end game condition trigger. This was worth the trip to the US alone.<br/><br/>I, along with John Wilson, also managed to distribute some ashcan copies of Solipsist, a game about bending reality. I'm hoping to get some playtest out of that too. But didn't run it at the con.<br/><br/>Finally, I GM'd Acts of Evil, which was weird as I came in after everyone had their characters. The GM's role seems to consist of throwing scenes at the players, where the GM is the protagonist and the player the antagonist. It was fun for me as the players were in three different places and times, and that kept me on my toes. My fumblings were, hopefully, minor (I got the gender of one character wrong at least once) but I quite liked the scenes I threw, and the reactions to them were excellent.<br/><br/>As you'd expect from Paul the mechanics are subtle, run somewhat counter to your first reaction, and tight. Hey, I rolled a 3 on a d6 (my face looks like that's a mediocre result). The other players are grinning since they know it's a success (prime numbers indicate successes). Then everyone laughs at me, then themselves since that was their reaction too before they were in on the way it worked, and a lightbulb clicks on for me about how <em>that</em> works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89665/#Comment_89665" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T04:58:29+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  4:58AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2007 4:58AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>(prime numbers indicate successes)</blockquote>\nNot primes, <i>Lebesgue primes.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89668/#Comment_89668" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T05:21:14+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  5:21AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops, yes, sorry for my lack of precision.
