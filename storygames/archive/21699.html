Here are the two relevant class skills (I highly recommend reading the class list for interesting ideas, google MADCorp Employees Handbook).<br/><br/><b>Where the fuck did he come from?</b><br/>Once per job, you can vanish from sight and reappear just where you are least expected \u2013 perfect for getting the drop on people who panic and run away, so that you can try to murder them. Anyone you do this to is automatically surprised, and <i>Rattled </i>to boot.<br/><br/><b>Murder someone helpless or unsuspecting.<br/></b>Make a HIT check to murder someone helpless or unsuspecting. A successful murder kills the victim outright. The Ref must judge the prospective victim as helpless or unsuspecting. Someone who is tied up, has gone down, or has gone critical is automatically helpless, and anyone that you surprise, sneak up on, or hide and lie in<br/>wait for is automatically unsuspecting. On a bust, they notice you before you can do it, and you\u2019re in a normal combat situation. Helpless victims don\u2019t require a roll.<br/>You are +1 <b>[advantage - Krippler]</b> to murder if you use some dangerous feature of the surroundings, such as high-voltage wires, heavy machinery, or pointy things suitable for impaling. (See also the Slasher trait below). Witnessing a murder inflicts mental trauma. Partners are Rattled, except your buddies; they\u2019re kindof used to it, but they still think you\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 psycho. Enemies are either Rattled, Harrowed, or Horrified, depending on how brutal the Ref judges your murder to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474762/#Comment_474762" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-15T07:39:02+00:00" title="June 15, 2018  7:39AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the 25gp/7 day thing is unnecessary. (And making it retroactive is awkward... like, do I need to intentionally do nothing for a few weeks to make sure that I have time to retroactively spend on this? And that may not make sense in the fiction--e.g. if the time spent occurred before I ever came to this place, and thus had an opportunity to start cultivating personas...).<br/><br/>Having to declare "walking offstage" and then not being there immediately, seems like a good enough balance. You could certainly make this a daily ability (or similarly time-limited) if you are worried about abuse.<br/><br/>An option for a higher-level ability: you don't have to declare that you've walked off-stage. You were there earlier, and nobody noticed you slink off when the you were out of focus in the scene, so to speak. This probably works best when it implies that you've somehow stealthily killed/KO'd the imitated NPC without anyone noticing--an almost supernatural effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474764/#Comment_474764" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-15T08:10:23+00:00" title="June 15, 2018  8:10AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2018 8:13AM by 2097.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Val, I like that phrasing.<br/><br/>The 25gp/7 day thing is from the 5e PHB version of these two class features.<br/>ditch it if you want. It's not there for balance purposes, it's there because it's cool to imagine the assassin doing this prep work. Like Elektra working for weeks and weeks mopping floors in The Redeemer.<br/><br/>The assassin in my group thought it was cool, added some more verisimilitude to the features. It's like "Oh, I spent a week in Chult back in 1387 and that's when I created this persona". And when you are truly in a new place then you can't use this. And, it goes from 7 days &amp; 25 gp to 3h &amp; free four levels later.<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Stephen P" rel="nofollow">Stephen P</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And that may not make sense in the fiction--e.g. if the time spent occurred before I ever came to this place, and thus had an opportunity to start cultivating personas...</p></div></blockquote>\nThe time spent need to be time <i>there</i>.

You were, like, standing at the back of the group, behind everyone \u2014 or so they thought. But, since it's TotM, and everyone has their own mental picture of what's happening, you can lose a lot of the sense of presence if they had pictured you standing in front of them. That slinking away works great in a movie but not as well in a TotM game. This was actually one of the things I had in mind to fix but I didn't have to since the thing I wanted to fix was just in my misremembrance.<br/><br/>OK so this ability would be 20% cooler if the other players don't know you had it. If out of the blue, no known ability, no loud declaration, you're just "suddenly, you see the cook wink at you, and put up her index finger in front of her lips in a silent shush". But distributing abilities without putting them in the PHB / houserule doc becomes a very different kind of game. Arguably other DMs have the chance to do this, if they have an assassin player and the other players in the group don't read S-G, you can send them this ability via email or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474765/#Comment_474765" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-15T08:16:44+00:00" title="June 15, 2018  8:16AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Stephen P" rel="nofollow">Stephen P</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>do I need to intentionally do nothing for a few weeks</p></div></blockquote>\nLike, let's say you arrive to a truly new place. An underground city on the moon. Needing to take downtime to prepare seems pretty awesome to me! And in line with the PHB phrasing of the class feature.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
