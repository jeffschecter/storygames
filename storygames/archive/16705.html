Check out <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/06/11/students-assigned-to-cheat-on.html" rel="nofollow">this presentation and article that Boingboing.net brings us</a>.  Some military security educators presented their students with an impossible task (memorize 100 digits of pi overnight) and told them that the only way to pass the test was to cheat without getting caught.  So students created interesting, creative ways to cheat at the test.  (Inserting answers onto soda cans, course books, Powerpoint presentations or, in one case, bringing in a filled out test sheet ahead of time.<br/><br/><br/>So then... could you make a game where the only way to succeed was to cheat?  Could you make a roleplaying game where PCs only succeed by players cheating?  You would need a robust system in place (so that the players have some noise to work with and lie about).  But that system would ultimately need to be weighted against the PCs.  Possibly the system would need to be something more than pass/fail in some way.  This would give players some levers to push the game the way that they want.<br/><br/>Is this a terrible idea?  I don't know.  Maybe.  In the wrong hands it might really damage people's trust for one another.  Perhaps it's not functional as an actual game, but it might be an interesting thought experiment.  <br/><br/>(Cheating as a game mechanic would also would be interestingly thematic for games about hackers or the like.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381921/#Comment_381921" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T16:10:03+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  4:10PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kinda did something like this with <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?381y6sjpon5stnn" rel="nofollow">Companies &amp; Carpools</a>, where players are Cthuloid horrors playing a game about mundane humans.

This definitely gets at the sort of thing I find interesting in this idea: the cheating puts the player and GM in an entertainingly complicated adversarial relationship.  Do I push my luck on the die roll and lie even though it's technically a miss?  How much do I inflate my numbers before the GM starts to get suspicious?  And you as GM are questioning every number I give you, to try to guess which are real and which are fake.

I was talking with a friend who is really into street-fighter type competitive play about the ways that gaming culture embraces mechanics perceived as broken and you end up with homogenous competitive fields all using the same technique\u2014except for when you meet someone from a different culture and suddenly you're rooting for their alternative play style.<br/><br/>The other ingredient that interests me is the way that scripted video game narratives are almost invariably about underdog outsider characters kicking the asses of a system that is getting them down. I'd love to see games that took that to its limit and started to require going outside of the system, giving the narrative a real quality to it. A great example is Portal which has a cliche, scripted narrative which makes a big deal about getting outside the box  of the games levels, but even as you do so you are following pre-written puzzle solutions.

Basically, it's a cooperative game where each player picks a doctor to play, except one who is House. The goal is to solve the mystery of what the sick person of the week has.<br/><br/>If it's figured out in time, everyone wins.<br/><br/>Here's the caveat, the House player can cheat. As much or as little as they want. <br/>Also, if any of the other doctor players catch the House player cheating, the doctor player wins immediately. And is the only winner. It would be a lot easier for House to cheat or to catch House cheating than it would be to cure the patient normally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ishaibarnoy" title="ishaibarnoy"><img alt="ishaibarnoy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/923/nBMVUZWQ7C7SB.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ishaibarnoy">ishaibarnoy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381963/#Comment_381963" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T20:07:39+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  8:07PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea of the House game.  Me, I like the idea of cheating, even more so the idea of players who are so inexperienced or absent-minded that they end up cheating anyway, just give them enough time.  Me, I actually feel that each game necessitates entirely different forms of cheating.  <br/><br/>In D&amp;D, for instance, fudging high rolls (or otherwise "crafting" a character that constantly produces high rolls) is the main mode of cheating because that's pretty much the only event in the game where something interesting happens.  Now, in games that make the event of a "failure" produce as interesting or as intense a result as a "success," the cheating probably happens different.<br/><br/>With a quick speculative example just off the top of my head, I imagine that Burning Wheel invites more cheating in Duel of Wits, Fight, and skill advancement ("How did you get those seven challenging tests? We've only been playing ten minutes!"), since those produce the most interesting feedback from the game.  I guess I haven't thought very deeply about Artha, but, well...<br/><br/>Anyway, my own very recent game, <a href="http://ishaibarnoy.blogspot.com/2012/06/my-new-game-05-b00p.html" rel="nofollow">05 B00P (a story game about Swedish robots telling one another secrets in the dark)</a>, takes into account the notion of cheating, but mostly in an interpretive sense.  Mostly, I invite the players merely to consider that their friends might be cheating, either intentionally or not.  So yeah, players who cheat might get to tell more stories, but the other players are invited to listen for those things and to treat their friends in an appropriate but still friendly fashion.<br/><br/>Eh, well, sorry to plug my own game, but it's an example of the topic at hand.  Really, I'd prefer to keep talking about other games and how cheating occurs in them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381981/#Comment_381981" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T21:58:13+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  9:58PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't any heist/caper/Leverage game out there about the PCs cheating the NPCs?<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ishaibarnoy" title="ishaibarnoy"><img alt="ishaibarnoy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/923/nBMVUZWQ7C7SB.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ishaibarnoy">ishaibarnoy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381986/#Comment_381986" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T22:22:36+00:00" title="June 11, 2012 10:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Isn't any heist/caper/Leverage game out there about the PCs cheating the NPCs?<br/>--<br/>TAZ</blockquote>\nYes, of course.

Decoding the message will earn you useful stuff for the event. Plus, it will give you time to practice the substitution cypher, and I'll be using the same one during the event. So those who practice it will be able to decode messages quickly during the event.<br/><br/>Also, I'll be giving out "extra credit assignments" in person during the weekend leading up to the event. So those who find me can get other tasks to do that will give them more useful stuff during the game.<br/><br/>The event is based on Harry Potter's TriWizard Tournament. So all this "cheating" intentionally coincides with the way that other characters help and hinder Harry during the tournament. And things like the way people bespell his broomstick during Quidditch matches.<br/><br/>So it's a PvP competitive game, which normally I would play extremely straight up in order to level the playing ground as much as possible.

I think what they really enjoyed was that their half-orc assassin or whatever could handily slaughter any opposition put in front of him, outperform nearly every other PC in nearly every other regard, and generally could do whatever he wanted to do without failure. Getting away with it was more of an etiquette requirement (ie, don't go "too far" and get kicked out of the game) than it was a reward in its own right.\n<blockquote>If you don't put it in the rules, but set up the rules in such a way that success is vanishingly unlikely without cheating, unless people are already committed to playing this particular game (solitaire, etc.) then they will just go "oh, this game is impossible" and discard it.</blockquote>\nThis seems to be in line with my experience; games with especially punishing failure rates for PCs definitely encourage cheat-prone players to start cheating because they cannot possibly succeed as much as they want to if they don't, but are also less attractive to cheat-prone players to begin with because there are other games where success does not require so much cheating to achieve.<br/><br/>I think you really do lose more than you gain if you don't call out the premise up front and let everyone know that the game IS about cheating and that they are expected to do it. Without that understanding going in, the cheating is going to feel less like "This is where the point of the game is" and more like "What idiot designed this stupid game, anyway?"                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382130/#Comment_382130" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T17:31:59+00:00" title="June 12, 2012  5:31PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2012 11:20PM by Andy.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I think you really do lose more than you gain if you don't call out the premise up front and let everyone know that the game IS about cheating and that they are expected to do it.

The instructors wanted to make the test so hard that the students would have to cheat to pass, and would decide that of their own initiative.  But they determined that put students in an unfair ethical situation and that many students would choose to fail rather than cheat.  (They didn't mention that this would set a bad example for future courses or that the students who didn't cheat would fail to learn the intended lesson.)  In the end, they determined that they had to inform the students that cheating was part of the test, at which point the real test could begin.  In a game as well, stating up front "this isn't really a game about memorizing strings of random numbers; it's a game about cheating" would help get players and GMs all on the same page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382133/#Comment_382133" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T17:41:48+00:00" title="June 12, 2012  5:41PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>If you put "cheating is okay" in the rules, the thrill of cheating is gone.</blockquote>\nWhile you may remove the thrill of breaking the rules, you still have plenty of other forms of fun involved.  Your PC is still succeeding (the primary emotional reward in most RPGs).  And you've pulled one over on your friends, who didn't catch your cheating.  That seems like a very satisfying emotional payoff, especially if there's a post-session (post-campaign?) bit where you each reveal your secret methods and everyone else is amazed and amused at how you fooled them.  (Bonus XP for most creative or elaborate cheat?)<br/><br/><br/>Perhaps at the end of each session, the GM can introduce one new 'security measure' to make cheating harder.  If the GM thinks that players are using loaded dice, then he might declare that the players must use his dice for the next session.  (These restrictions might be freeform or might be from a predefined list.)  but the players are informed of this in advance, so they have until next session to figure out new cheating methods (sneak into the GM's house and tamper with those dice?  Get an identical weighted set and pull some sleight of hand to switch them in play?  Adjust your PC's stats up by small amounts across the board?).  This would prompt players to start to think up new methods every session or every few sessions, depending on what system they have working already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
