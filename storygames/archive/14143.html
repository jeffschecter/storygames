For those whom this is an old argument or old discussion please enlighten me and send me links to books and site and posts to read.  I do understand the idea of character as an alternate identity, part and parcel to the story but I'm uncertain how that challenges the idea as it has seemed to in the past.<br/><br/>Story - an account of imaginary or real people and events told for entertainment.<br/><br/>People, characters are at the heart of our hobby, our art, and no character can be brought to life without a player.  There are time when the only even happening in the plot are the characters meeting.  The story unfold from there.  When the author or screen write tells a story, what is she doing?  She's not only describing the weather and what paintings are on the wall, she's giving life to the characters through action and word.<br/><br/>How then is playing a character in improv or an RPG any different?  Authorship does NOT separate one from the character.  Authorship separates one further from the mysteries the author unfolds.  There would be no story if the players didn't detail their characters involvement in the setting and events.  And no plot moves forward until we see what the characters say and do in relation to the events and one another.  That is clearly authorship.<br/><br/>A game supporting immersion simply means that surprises about ones own past and pacing mechanism must be kept at a minimum to give the player the most room to explore the character and briefly live like her.  Walk in her shoes.<br/><br/>While players may seek after an immersive experience, it is by far not a creative agenda (and I mean that in a broad sense of the term, not necessarily tied to the Bog Theory).  As with everything in a game, it should be part of the social contract.  How far are we willing to go to suspend disbelief.  For each group that answer is very different thus why we discuss line and veils.  I say this to my groups all the time, remember that line and veils are not just for taboos like rape, torture and incest.  Players have means of playing they prefer - the balance of rules, GM and player power; groups agreeing that in a group dynamic the good of the group outweighs the good of the player; how much table chatter there will be, etc.  That's all part of lines and veils.<br/><br/>Some games support certain modes of play.  D&amp;D has a group dynamic clearly predicated on balance and fairness; Apocalypse World tells the Master of Ceremonies to make the players believe in the world; Fiasco allows you do determine your own successes and failures; while Burning Empires focuses on the effects the characters lives have on the larger story.  <br/><br/>Immersion is just a way to tell your character's story - first person rather than third person.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320526/#Comment_320526" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T10:35:19+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 10:35AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was about to respond but I realized I don't totally understand your post.<br/><br/>Maybe you should link to the discussion on the blog and that'll clear things up...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320529/#Comment_320529" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T10:52:01+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 10:52AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My bad, actually, I meant Facebook.

They're engaged decisions, absolutely.  But they aren't about me playing to the character; they're about me playing to the story.

Why it's the same is because while playing a character you* may not be thinking about the story the character's actions ARE the story.  You are playing your character and putting your characters perspective before all other concerns (hopefully not to the detriment of the entertainment of your fellow players).  That is just your method of storytelling.  It is what makes the game sing for you and maybe the way you prefer to play, but you are still generating story none-the-less.  Some people have more or less tolerance for rambly Woody Allen-esque narrative but narrative it is.  So, as a point of example to bring it back to social contract, if you were to approach a game and say "what is my creative agenda" your choice would be among the three not to create another category.  Now I think theres cross over and Immersionism is a mode of play but I am not going to get into that.  All I'm going to say is that you are persuing the purest for of story by wanting to play out your character with as few distractions as possible.<br/><br/>Obviously I wrote that with far less time and consideration than my initial post but hey, it can always get reworked <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don<br/><br/><br/>*not pointed toward Levi but a general "you"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320557/#Comment_320557" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T11:53:08+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 11:53AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2011 11:56AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>When playing Dogs, I've made many choices (as GM or player) for reasons of<i>pacing</i>- wanting the fiction to intensify or relax, etc.  And to me, those are not-immersed decisions.

Sure, pushing around minis where your interaction is "I roll a 18 and do 25 points of damage,"   Your point of pride isn't "that was a great story" rather "we nailed dem orcs good!" (yeah Im being simplistic and we all know these all work together) or when the players all sit back and say "okay, we have the natives under our thumbs and the water is rerouted to the settlement" whether or not it's a good story is immaterial, there your point to to create a world and develop it.<br/><br/>And hell, I admit when you really get into a character and you two just connect (player and character) you don't necessarily recognize it as the same thing but I think it  stems from the same point of pride.  We often don't prescribe playing characters as being authors because our models are novel, films and the like where the author is more reflected in a GM role.  However, RPGs are far more like improv.  There is a situation and the players are taking it to a particular level.  <br/><br/>Now heres the part that gets under certain people's skin... it's all fiction.  Yeah, you could argue theories of identity and "what's real" but we're all creating fiction.  Whether a player thinks "wow, right now would be a great time in the story to bring out that I'm really the villain" or it just happens as a course of the player playing the character, the outcome and pride lands in the very same place.<br/><br/>no?<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320574/#Comment_320574" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T12:13:19+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 12:13PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie, what Chris said.

Or are we talking about, after the play is done and the dice have been put away, standing around and valuing the narrative that we just finished creating?  Or both, or neither?

Don introduced the word "fiction" (properly I think). And now you're discussing "narrative."<br/><br/>I'd say you're right. In a dungeon crawl there is narrative. That doesn't make it <i>story</i>.<br/><br/>A sequence of fictional things is certainly narrative. A story is something else more defined.<br/><br/>I'd offer, to answer your question, when I play the games I like to play, I'm valuing the making of story both in the moment of creation (or, probably, in the split second after the moment, when I see what I thought up and realized it was good), and in the post-game reflection.<br/><br/>I'll warn you, my head already is beginning to spin on, "When do we have an idea? What is an idea? When do we judge an idea in relation to having it?" I mean, we might need to bring in brain scanners if you want to go down the rabbit hole you seem to be pointing at!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320584/#Comment_320584" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T12:43:14+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 12:43PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just trying to use 'story' the way eruditus has defined it:<br/><br/>"Story - an account of imaginary or real people and events told for entertainment."<br/><br/>It may or may not be a good definition, but it's his thread, so I'm trying to play along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320587/#Comment_320587" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T12:53:51+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 12:53PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough.

That's not what I am saying.  Honestly I used to be one of the people who used to think the big model missed Immersive play and thought that some nod should have been made to people who focus not on mechanics, or the setting or the plot, rather the character itself... performers, people who took pride in playing their character well.<br/><br/>After looking at it closer I just can't separate the performance from the fiction it's creating.  Yes, I'm proud of the performance, of how I got the character, how things felt natural and energized.  When it came down to it, though, that performance and the energy is the same thing that develops in improv and what we're going for ends up just being some gradient on two ends of the spectrum of authorship.

And I'm not saying the Turkus are wrong for reaching for that bar. I'm saying it's a strict discipline that I've never seen in practice anywhere I've ever been in any game session anywhere. Every game I've ever participated in people are constantly moving back and forth between engagement with their characters and being aware there's -- you know -- a real world outside of the fictional elements being verbalized at the table. I don't see any way around that.<br/><br/>And if we want to really focus on the concept of "looking down on the story and appreciating it," I can only offer that any creative act is full of this <i>all the time</i>.<br/><br/>A painter puts down a brushstroke that makes perfect, impulsive sense... and then takes a step back and looks at the painting as a whole once more, judging it, to see where he'll be putting a brushstroke next.<br/><br/>A screenwriter is completely caught up in the experience of the characters, their emotions, the conflict of the scene... and then, looks over the page when he's done and has a sense of, "Ah, that's good," or "Oh, not yet..." and dives back in again.<br/><br/>Actors in the wings of a stage can watch their fellow cast members acting out a scene onstage, judging it well and delighted with the work they are watching, and then step out on stage, "in" character, and start delivering lines as if they had just entered from the garden or whatever.<br/><br/>Between these two points --1)  that Immersion is <i>never</i> an unbroken sense of reality of experience the life outside of <i>being</i> the character (except, of course, outside the trance-like immersion the Turku School seeks); and 2) the reality that the creative act is always an moving seamlessly back and forth between open creation and  judgment of some kind, I simply don't know what people mean when they say awareness of any kind outside their character "breaks" immersion for them. <br/><br/>But that might just be me.<br/><br/>Am I suggesting anything in the words above that seems really strange or contradictory to your experiences when you gather with friends to play an RPG session?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320604/#Comment_320604" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T14:46:02+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  2:46PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want to ignore too much of the conversation, but it seems like there's at least one definitional gap in here.<br/><br/>My gut reaction is Immersion is Simulationism.<br/><br/>If your first internal question is "What would my character do, given the game world?", I'd call that Simulationist.<br/>If your first question is "What would make the most interesting story?", I'd call that Narrativist.<br/>("What's the optimal thing for my character to do?" is the Gamist question. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> )<br/><br/>Of course, you can keep multiple questions in your head at once, and balance them off, and ignore some sometimes.

The players I know who really value immersion insist that it's about their internal experience, not about the external outputs. <br/><br/>The best metaphor I can come up with is that you can't separate the idea of a mode of transport with the fact of going somewhere. But while these players agree that the destination is important, they really want to travel slowly on a bicycle with the wind in their hair.

Here's what I wrote:<br/><br/>Immersionism focuses on deeply experiencing the character, to the point of minimizing the sense of self. This usually comes through a combination of the Embodiment, Flow, and Catharsis motives, often within the context of a strong Exploration interest. The focus on being the character often includes the Protagonist motive as well \u2013 it\u2019s nice if your character has a visible impact on the world. Some Immersionists value Crafting either before or during the event as part of the overall experience, though Exhibition is often viewed as a purely player motive and discouraged. Other player-focused motives, such as Fellowship, are often discouraged as well.<br/><br/>The motives I'm talking about (which are the focus of the article)<br/>1.\tAudience - Experience a satisfying narrative.<br/>2.\tCatharsis - Experience emotions through the character.<br/>3.\tComprehension - Figure things out. Solve problems and puzzles.<br/>4.\tCompetition - Win at something, or at least enjoy the act of competing.<br/>5.\tCrafting - Create non-ephemeral things (costumes, props, documents, etc.).<br/>6.\tEducation \u2013 Take away new knowledge or understanding as a player.<br/>7.\tEmbodiment \u2013Make decisions based on character background, knowledge, and motivation.<br/>8.\tExercise - Enjoy physical activity and movement.<br/>9.\tExploration - Experience the fictional setting.<br/>10.\tExhibition - Show off (costumes, props, acting chops, mad skillz, etc.) and get kudos.<br/>11.\tFellowship - Enjoy time with friends (also includes flirting and such).<br/>12.\tFlow \u2013 Enjoy losing oneself in the moment.<br/>13.\tLeadership - Be important to the player community.<br/>14.\tProtagonist - Be important to the story and impact the game world.<br/>15.\tSpectacle - Experience the awesome stuff (pretty costumes, elaborate sets, funny NPCs, etc.)<br/>16.\tVersatility \u2013 Collect important things (spells, lore, favors, etc.) and have the right thing at the right time. <br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Some games include explicit techniques to drive story that occur outside the personal characterization by the player. Many hardcore immersionist players balk at such techniques. For example:<br/><br/>The bird-in-ear technique used in jeepform games. This is a technique where the GM speaks out an internal monologue on behalf of a player's character in an attempt to guide the game toward certain kinds of interactions - for example, having a character speak of his budding attraction toward another character. This level of external control of character thoughts is deeply offensive to many immersion-focused players, but it can be a powerful technique in helping to create a better story.<br/><br/>The fan mail technique in Prime Time Adventures, where a player is encouraged to reward another player for creating awesome stuff in the fiction. This is a less invasive technique, but it's something that makes you think as a player rather than as a character, and many immersion-focused players find such a thing breaks them out of the flow of ideal immersion.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I don't think anyone has ever tried to say that immersive characterization can't lead to a good story. I think it's a matter of priorities.<br/><br/>A narrative-focused player may make a decision that is "bad" for their character, both from a strategy perspective (essentially the gamist perspective) and from a characterization perspective (basically the immersionist perspective) because that decision will make the story more awesome.<br/><br/>Also, a narrative-focused player is more likely to accept outside influences on their characterization. Often among immersion-focused players, there is an unwillingness to accept outside influences on their characterization. (However, discussions of this often flip-flop between discussions of the Protagonist motive and the Embodiment motive, which I think are different things that get overlapped and confused in discussions of this.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320617/#Comment_320617" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T16:11:32+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  4:11PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cy</cite>If your first internal question is "What would my character do, given the game world?", I'd call that Simulationist.<br/>If your first question is "What would make the most interesting story?", I'd call that Narrativist.</blockquote>\nHi Cy, <br/><br/>I'm going to stick to my guns here.<br/><br/>What if one thinks the way to "make the most interesting story" is precisely to have "your character do, given the game world."<br/><br/>Certainly that's what I believe to be the case.

It's act one, and I want a nemesis."<br/>"My character is a normal person, who'd call the cops and hide in a corner, but this is an investigation game, so I'm going to go follow up on the creepy sounds."<br/><br/>This is related to Jamie's point about real life being immersive, but not necessarily a good story.  Most people want to resolve tension in their lives as soon as it comes up, will talk through misunderstandings with their friends if they see them starting to form, will avoid even slightly dangerous situations.  A lot of PCs are less prone to act like that, but not necessarily in all areas.  That's where the divergence between "character would do" and "interesting story" usually shows up for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320625/#Comment_320625" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T16:46:39+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  4:46PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2011 5:02PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Cy, <br/><br/>Yeah. I don't play like that.<br/><br/>I can only point out here that I'm all about specific when I talk about these things: What games are we talking about? What rules are we talking about? How were the characters created? What's on the character sheet? What is the relationship between the Players and the Game Master?<br/><br/>In a <i>Sword &amp; Sorcerer</i> game that Jesse Burneko ran once, I was a guy -- just a guy. But my guy's Kicker was, "My Fiance has been kidnapped." Fuck all if I wasn't worried for my guy as he pushed deeper into trouble. But he wasn't going to wait around for the authorities. With my Kicker I had authored a situation I cared about and was going to take action on. My guy was going to drive forward to deal with the fact that his Fiance had been kidnapped. Jesse's job was to create opportunities and opposition to my efforts. Boom: Story. I didn't need to think anything through in terms of "best story." The game prep of <i>Sorcerer</i> sets up the pieces for a good story, and then the Players go to town. The story stuff is structured on the character sheet. Same with <i>Dogs</i>, same with <i>In a Wicked Age..</i>., same with <i>Hero Wars</i>, same with <i>Polaris</i>, and so on... <br/><br/>As far as people wanting tension to dissipate goes, sure. But that's why there's a Game Master in these games. To keep throwing problems at the Players. How the Players choose to have their characters deal with the new problems -- well, that's up to them. But if the stakes matter to the Players (via the Characters they created) and the Game Master is paying attention to what is on those character sheets, it'll never be easy for someone to just walk away.<br/><br/>I mean, I don't know. This might come down to, "You and I would have to play a game together some time and see how we play"!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320647/#Comment_320647" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T20:12:31+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  8:12PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Don,<br/><br/>Your descriptions of play make perfect sense to me.  However, I don't see any connection between what you've described and Ron's definition of Narrativism as social priority recognizable by behavior.  Digging into a character and churning out good stories could happen in any CA type.<br/><br/>Levi's point about "keep an eye on story" seems to me to illustrate the G/N/S point, and Christopher's, "no, just play your character" seems to miss that point.  It's never <b>just</b> "play your character" -- that would mean no CA is present.  Every choice you make for <b>how</b> you play your character exists within the context of whether your group is trying to Dream, Step On Up, or Address Premise Now, and your play will be rewarded or not accordingly.<br/><br/>I don't think it's hard to imagine highly immersive Gamism.  Play a character trapped in a brilliant death trap with a ticking clock, and you must use your character's tools to escape or die in a single session.  No die rolls, just working skillfully with the facts of the fiction.  If that doesn't sound immersive to you, well, maybe your own immersion tastes simply run toward Story Now play.  That'd make sense to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320649/#Comment_320649" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T20:25:47+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  8:25PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2011 8:59PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, if I may...<br/><br/>The thread was begun as a response to the notion that Immersion and Narrativism are somehow at odds to each other.<br/><br/>I haven't said once that all one needs to do is "just play your character" to produce Narrativist play. In fact, I specifically replied to Jamie's question by explicitly stating that just being immersed would not be enough to produce story. My only point is you damned well better be playing your character to produce Narrativist play.<br/><br/>I've suggested several times that one needs to bring in the context of the game at hand and the rules being used. That's usually where Premise gets baked into play. But that's been beyond the scope of this thread. Or, at least, I assumed it was. <br/><br/>As far as I can tell this notion that Immersion and Narrativism work just fine together has been Don's point and concern all along as well. No one has made any claim to laying out ALL that is required for Narrativist play, just that Immersion and Narrativism play are not at odds. That's the only thing that's been at stake in this thread. As far as I can tell.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Now, when it comes to Narrativism, yes, that's where the Players have to address Premise in some way. And that's why <i>Sorcerer</i> has Humanity and <i>In A Wicked Age...</i> has competing Best Interests and different manners of addressing conflicts with different pros and cons as to what kind of conflict you're going have... But because these elements are baked into the procedures (from the first moment you begin creating a character onward), one doesn't have to sit around <i>intellectualizing</i> how to get around to making choices that address Premise as a Player. You're going to be rushing forward or recoiling via your character time and time again and the game -- because these are well designed games -- are going to be doing a lot of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>In all cases you're better off playing your character straight out of the heart. My only point was that playing straight out of the Heart, from the point of view of your character, experiencing the world via your character and responding in kind, is not only <i>not</i> at odds with Narrativism but vital for play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320652">\n<div

Cthulhu?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320660/#Comment_320660" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T21:44:49+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  9:44PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>That's an interesting thought. I think Vincent makes a strong case in the post I linked, but it's possible that what you're looking for in immersion is something different? I don't really have a bun in this fight, as I don't find (what I call) immersion particularly challenging.<br/><br/>I think the current discussion around drama resolution and freeform play that came out of your Delve discussion is pretty interesting, and will hopefully yeild some useful insights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320661/#Comment_320661" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T21:47:18+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  9:47PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2011 10:16PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David,<br/><br/>I really didn't notice the title. So, I'm not sure. I certainly will wait to hear from Don if I've been wrong about what he's saying.<br/><br/><br/>As for White's quote I just learned something really important tonight. I unlocked something that's boggled my mind for years as this confusion goes around and around forever.<br/><br/>Here's the full quote from <a href="http://billwhite.blogspot.com/2010/05/callois-and-creative-agenda.html" rel="nofollow">the blog post:</a><br/><br/><i>"When you think about it, you realize that this mode is actually rather obscure, a kind of play that works by having one stand in a kind of alienation or distance from the character one plays in order to more strongly appreciate the moral weight of the decisions the character makes--this in contrast to the strong identification with character that is the desideratum of immersive play and the elision of character that is the hallmark of competitive play."</i><br/><br/>Okay. I finally understand something.<br/><br/>When folks are talking about how you can't be immersed for Narrativism there's this sense of it that you're supposed to be stepped back and judging what you're doing. Roger suggests as much with his post above. There's this notion that the <i>Agenda</i> of Narrativism is to make these choices and then step back and appraise them.<br/><br/>No. It is not.<br/><br/>The Agenda of Narrativism is address Premise. Period, full stop.<br/><br/>That's it. <br/><br/>Did you get a chance to address Premise? You did? Bam! Awesome. Let's move on.<br/><br/>That's it.<br/><br/>Addressing Premise has never been an intellectual exercise. It's visceral and emotional. You're wife finds ritual tools your closet -- ritual tools you're using to control a Demon that is keeping your daughter alive. Your wife confronts you. What do you tell her? <br/><br/>That's it. You're about to address Premise. Because everything is complicated and you're about to make a statement with your characters words and actions about what kind of father and husband he is. <br/><br/>But even that sounds too intellectualized. You don't need to be aware that you're doing that. What you need to be aware of is that the Game Master is portraying the wife and she's confronting your guy and you need to respond <i>in some way</i>...<br/><br/>And if those are the moments that turn you on most in play -- whether it's Jack not sure if he should buy the magic beans, or Sam not sure if he should kill Gollum, or whether your someone on the Galactica not sure if you should rig an election to make sure to save the fleet -- if those kinds of moments are why you showed up, then your needs are being met, your hitting your Agenda and your having a great time.<br/><br/>You don't need to sit back and <i>judge</i> how it went. You needed to just <i>do it</i>.<br/><br/>Is everyone seeing this? It isn't about patting yourself on the back that you addressed Premise a moment ago. It's about addressing Premise in the moment you're doing it. For some people that's fun and compelling and the best reason for playing. That -- "<i>addressing</i> Premise", not "having addressed Premise" -- is the Creative Agenda!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

Prime Time Adventures, where a player is encouraged to reward another player for creating awesome stuff in the fiction. This is a less invasive technique, but it's something that makes you think as a player rather than as a character, and many immersion-focused players find such a thing breaks them out of the flow of ideal immersion."<br/><br/>I kind of see that. I'm still boggled. We're playing a game. There's food on the table. (Or is there?) There are people sitting in modern day clothes. There are dice on the table. I'm making up fictional stuff with friends and you have your character say something funny, and we all laugh, and you laugh too, and I'm assuming that's breaking immersion. But does it?<br/><br/>I ask because things like Fan Mail are used as examples of things that break immersion, but as far as I can tell <i>the whole situation of sitting around playing an RPG makes reaching the idealized version of immersion I keep hearing about utterly impossible.</i><br/><br/>Why are things like Fan Mail the special case, whereas slices of pizza, rattling dice, shaking your head when you miss a roll not immersion-busters?<br/><br/>I honestly don't get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320677/#Comment_320677" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T23:17:26+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 11:17PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2011 1:36AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Why are things like Fan Mail the special case, whereas slices of pizza, rattling dice, shaking your head when you miss a roll not immersion-busters?</blockquote>\nI never really got this argument, either.  It seems to me to be less about immersion and more about what people think is fun about gaming.<br/><br/>There are people in our group whose fun lies almost solely in playing their characters.  If you ask them to GM a game, or narrate something outside their character, or engage with some system that works outside their character (spend a plot point or a drama die to declare something, etc.), it bothers them and they push back.  It snapped them out of the kind of play that they enjoyed the most: at best it was an unwelcome intrusion, at worst it was a dealbreaker.  Still, fan mail didn't seem to tweak that nerve when we played PTA (although "winning" narration rights sure as hell did, so no more PTA for us).<br/><br/>It's probably just another case of a nebulously-defined gaming term's most common definition becoming simply "stuff I like."  As in, "What's immersion?  Oh, it's what I like about gaming."  :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320680/#Comment_320680" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T23:52:16+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 11:52PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>There's this notion that the<i>Agenda</i>of Narrativism is to make these choices and then step back and appraise them . . .

I get how this is fun.  I'd want to decide "What do I tell her?" as immersed as possible too!  <br/><br/>But hey, maybe someone else wants to step back, and go, "My character's a tragic anti-hero... I think tragic anti-heroes always tell a disastrous lie in this situation... but I want to put a spin on that, so I'll have my character tell the truth, but color it in a misleading way... let's see how that feels, and how it turns out for him."

Apparently it is 'addressing premise', whatever that means.  Thats Ron Edwards version, isn't it?  Im sure there are many other versions.<br/><br/>Does that mean all good stories address a premise?  Because personally, my (ideal) agenda when I play is, in order of priority: <br/>a) have fun  <br/>b) have the game generate fiction comparable to a good book or movie.  <br/><br/>No narativism/premise in there.  There is implied immersion, because thats part of the fun for me.<br/><br/>I reckon narativist play is like some holy grail that people want without being able to pin down what it is they want it for.  Seems to me much more useful to work out what concrete aspects of the roleplaying experience you do enjoy, and concentrate on those.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320683/#Comment_320683" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T00:36:06+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 12:36AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2011 12:36AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David:<br/><br/>1. First, I'm not going to say playing that way isn't fun. It's not my place to say it wouldn't be fun, nor that it's wrong. If someone wants to do that and they're having fun, more power to them. I can only say that, in my view, it'd be less fun for me. It starts becoming more intellectual, less visceral. In my view (and please, no one argue this with me, I'm just answering David's question and then moving on) it's a flavor of The Right to Dream -- "I'm creating this kind of guy, and so this is what he's going to do." Right to Dream, in my view, is mostly about holding on to getting something "right" -- whether it be a genre or character type or world (from a novel or created by the group) or whatever. What I'm seeing in your example is not a Player addressing Premise through character, but a Player picking his way through the choices to make the right choice for this guy. And that's Right to Dream to me. BUT -- we're taking one fictional, hypothetical example rippled from any other game context. It's not really worth pursuing. My main point is, it's not how I'd play Story Now. But if I was playing <i>Pendragon</i> I'd be all over it, cause that's a hot and sweaty Right to Dream game, I can see how the rules would lead us to a moment like that, and it's a game that I love.<br/><br/>2. If you go read Bill's quote I can't see how he's talking about anything other than how I stand in relation to <i>my</i> character, not other people's characters. So, I'm simply going to drop that unless you want to make a case for it.<br/><br/>So, here's my thing about what happens when someone's character isn't present: there's no immersion, of course. That player is now either thinking about something else or an audience member watching the scene.<br/><br/>And here is what I have observed in such circumstances while playing <i>Sorcerer</i> or any of the games I've mentioned above. One of two things happens:<br/><br/>A) The Player is caught up trying to figure out what the hell he's going to say when the GM swings back around to his scene, because the GM is doing his job well, and the Player is like, "Oh, man, how am I going to convince this little old lady to let me search her apartment for my fiance's heart." And that's fine. He is, in character, feeling with his character, a way through the decision, which is very RPG.<br/><br/>or, <br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> He gets caught up as the audience member and really watches, the same way you'd watch a movie or tv show or read a book. Because when the GM and a Player (or Players) are really hitting all pistons on addressing Premise and the Players are really committed to feeling their way through a heartfelt, honest decision, it is compelling. Everyone watches, no one tunes out, no one is bored. That's my observation.<br/><br/><br/>I need to add, and I was just addressing this in PLAY SORCERER today, I don't mind flipping back and forth between being makers of the story and audience members of the story. Of course we're making it. Of course we're responding to what's happened. I mean, that's what happens at the table. There's no way around that. Unless people, of course, are actually pulling off this Inception-like Immersion where one has to make sure not to jostle the dream lest the illusion be ruined. But, as I've said above, I've never seen this in happen. I have seen (and experienced) absolute identification with the character. Rob linked to Matthijs Holter writing "\u201cI feel like my character is a semi-conscious, semiautonomous part of me, living inside my head, being channelled through my rational faculties."<br/><br/>However, I just don't think that's that big a deal. I've been a writer, an actor. I've done that again and again. We daydream all the time. We get lost in novels and books all the time. It's HUMAN to do this.<br/><br/>The distinctions I seem to be making from others is: 1) This Immersion thing isn't that big a deal and 2) Flipping in and out of it (cause, you know, the real world is all around us every fucking moment) is not that big a deal. <br/><br/>We're Immersed, we're not, and then we are again. That's what I've observed in one RPG sessions after another, from one end of the country to the other, over years upon years of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320686/#Comment_320686" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T01:09:25+00:00" title="April 15, 2011  1:09AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2011 1:51AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher,<br/><br/>Okay, feel free to call me on stupid jargon-use, but it seems to me that if your Narr m.o. is inherent to Narr, and so my example philosophizing player isn't doing Narr (maybe Sim instead), then you two are gonna have problems in the same group.

In other words, if your choice about what to do when your wife discovers your ritual implements isn't, e.g., <i>appreciated by those at the table</i> as an important statement about the character, then it's not "an instance of narrativist play." <br/><br/>It occurs to me that there could be lots of variations on how you as an individual shuttle back and forth between character-identification and character-appreciation; for example, you may strongly identify with your character's will to power while playing but admit to yourself later that the concomitant Humanity loss was merited (because engaging with the system in this way is a way of "addressing Premise"), and so forth, or you may simply take a moment to respond to the immersive play of others with a "Good role-playing, buddy!" thumbs-up.<br/><br/>It's true, of course, that one of the things about "immersion" is that it's possible to have players who approach it in different ways successfully play together even if they think playing the way another plays is "doing it wrong." Jiituomas Harviainen has written about that here: Harviainen, J. T. (2006). Information, immersion, identity. The interplay of multiple selves during live-action role-play. <i>Journal of Interactive Drama, 1</i>(2), 9-51.<br/><br/>One of the implications of Jiituomas's work, in my opinion, is to undercut the Big Model's insistence upon "coherence" as a fundamental design aesthetic, because it's possible to imagine multiple non-interacting reward cycles that operate on different CA.

Am I in a bizarrely lucky streak of incoherence that's fun?</blockquote>\nHello David and Bill,<br/><br/>David, your quote above is point on for me. I would suggest that the point I'm taking on this matter is still relatively new--just as Narrativism as something to simply recognize as something might want to do was only recently (relatively speaking) recognized a few years ago. When I go to conventions and play, especially when I'm GMing, getting people to play in a manner where they can trust their own gut, not worry about getting the character or story "right," and play within passion turns into part of my responsibility. I can only say that at some point people get into the groove and end the session by saying things like, "I wish I could bring my friends here and show them what just happened, because that's the most fun I've ever had playing an RPG."<br/><br/>So, it is a very different way of playing for lots of folks. Which is why people like me, or Jesse Burneko, or Ron Edwards or Vincent Baker and others keep hitting these same points again and again whenever these things come up.<br/><br/><br/>Bill, first, clearly, you know a <i>lot</i>. A lot more than me, frankly.<br/><br/>I can only write about and respond to my experiences in play.<br/><br/>In my experiences, the games where everyone has the same CA go better. Everything doesn't break down if everyone isn't on the same page, and there are shades of everyone being close enough on their surface behaviors where clearly things don't crash (as you an David have pointed out).<br/><br/>More importantly to me, however, is that a <i>persistent immersion</i> (which I think is you assumption about what Immersion is when you write about it, though I might be wrong, but that's been my take away), simply is not a goal of any kind for me. I simply don't believe it can exist as a goal outside of very specific circumstances where almost hypnotic trances are employed. And I'm not saying there aren't people out there doing that. I'm saying I've never been involved in anything like that.<br/><br/>When I play, I assume the rhythms of play are going to be more like a baseball game. When the players are out in the field there a lot of standing -- a <i>lot</i>. And then the pitcher makes a move, and the players get into gear, leaning forward, backing up, getting ready, whatever. There's a pitch -- and maybe nothing happens and everyone relaxes again. Or there's a hit and everyone scrambles really fast.... and then... there's a lot of standing again.<br/><br/>That's how I see games working whenever I've played. People slipping into the intensity or point of view of their character, and then leaving again. Just because, you know, we're a bunch of people sitting at a table in modern day clothes eating pretzels and stuff.<br/><br/>As for appreciating what other players are doing, I'm not sure if we're disagreeing with anything here. I would only offer that there seems to be an element of "judgment" or "overt recognition" that is sometimes present, but it's no less valid when it isn't.<br/><br/>For example, if David has his character say something funny, and I laugh, that's appreciation. I didn't have to step back from anything. I just responded. And that's the level that I think most CAs get their props from the table.<br/><br/>So, if you're the dude playing the guy who is about to have the confrontation with the wife and I simply, as a fellow player, get caught up watching because I find it compelling, that's appreciation. The appreciation will be felt at the table -- not because I'm "putting it on" but because I'm honest. Attention is appreciation. This has always been how I've seen the notion of reward at the table for CAs. Sometimes they are overt, but most of the time they are in the little micro-behaviors of how the players are simply listening and responding to each other at the table. <br/><br/>So, yeah, I'm standing back from your guy and appreciating it. So I'm not immersed. But it's clear from my posts I think that I'm not expecting everyone to be immersed the whole time anyway. What <i>are</i> doing, however, is continually moving into moments of compelling Premise again and again--as a group, in one way or another, the same way the team on the field is always acting in concert, even if only one or three players touch the ball during a play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320735/#Comment_320735" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T08:26:40+00:00" title="April 15, 2011  8:26AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2011 8:30AM by cy.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">As far as people wanting tension to dissipate goes, sure.

I play a lot of GM-less games, where that responsibility for driving at tension/ drama/ story is more of a shared responsibility.  Sometimes, my character is an antagonist, foil, secondary, or supporting character.  Those are the times when I'm thinking about what pushes the story in a cool direction or advances someone else's story over what my character would do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't choose actions based on what would make the story cool as much in GMed games, or when my character is more of the protagonist/lead for the scene.  There, I'd agree with you, staying "true" to the character, or at least figuring out how the character changes/ reacts to the situation are vital.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to fit into your analogy of the group as a team.  Sometimes, a character is supporting someone else's story.  When they are, it's more important that they support well than sticking to exactly what their character "would" do.

I mean, you can't really talk about Narrativism without talking about GNS, so I'm not sure what to make of "immersion does (or can be) a part of Narrativism" without getting all Forge Theory up in here.<br><br>My general sense of it is that Narrativism is supposedly about addressing premise, right?  Let's say our premise is like, "How far will someone go in order to get what they want?" (hey, it's Sorcerer!). Now, at the minimum, I'd say that at least SOMEONE at the table has to be pushing towards that premise, yeah?  If multiple players are, that's totally cool too. Otherwise, how do you ratchet it up and really focus on the question?  How do you keep raising the stakes and say, "Okay, well what about this far?  Will you go this far?"<br><br>Now, if you're in a GM'd game, the GM can be mostly responsible for pushing towards the premise and I don't see any reason why some or all of the players couldn't strive for immersion and use a lot of immersionist techniques (avoiding OOC stuff, or whatever they feel supports their own immersion, since that kind of thing seems to vary between individuals). However, in a GMless game, I'm not sure you can really have immersion + narrativism, or maybe even strong, consistent immersion at all (though maybe you can correct me on this), partially because SOMEONE still has to be thinking more OOC (at least semi-regularly, though not necessarily all the time) and driving the story forward, yeah? Who frames scenes? Who decides when to ratchet up the pressure? Those all seem like pretty OOC kinds of decisions and thinking to me.<br><br>One other comment: part of the fun I get out of Narrativism is a sense of enjoyment that comes from appreciating (in an OOC fashion) the premise being repeatedly addressed and partially answered, at least in the context of the game.  "How much further will this guy go? I don't know, let's see!"  And this happens both during play and after play.  And, like situational irony or other sorts of more outside-looking appreciations, I'm not sure it would be as easy to appreciate that from a more immersive standpoint, where I was focused on embodying a character. This isn't to say that this kind of OOC appreciation is critical for the game as a whole to address premise; I'm not sure it is.  But, again, I think it kinda goes hand it hand with SOMEONE at the table driving play forward.  If they don't have an OOC appreciation for how premise is being addressed, again it seems hard to really push that kind of play.<br><br/>Does that make any sense?  Again, I think it's been traditionally understood at the Forge that immersion is a body of techniques or a set of interests that doesn't really fit within a single one of the GNS creative agendas.  You can do immersion in all sorts of different kinds of play, conceivably, especially since the requirements for different players to feel immersed are often pretty different.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320782/#Comment_320782" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T11:01:08+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 11:01AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2011 11:11AM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to throw in a history perspective wrench.<br/><br/>The term Immersion did not come from tabletop play. It came from larp play. And I think that's important. Because it relies on some of the differences between the two.<br/><br/>In medium to large group larp play (20+ players) one can go a really long time, possibly the whole event, without interacting with a GM, or even a GM-planted NPC. The GM is, often, not a strong presence in the flow of the game. They create things up front, like the setting and the state of affairs at the beginning of the game. But after that, the influence can often be invisible.<br/><br/>In such an event, it is possible for the player to approach the game from a perspective of "I am going to spend all of my time just being my character as much as possible." There is no narration to listen to. There is no off-screen time. There is just you, as your character, experiencing what is happening and interacting with it.<br/><br/>Cranking that type of play up as much as possible is what lead to the term Immersion.<br/><br/>Immersion in GM-led tabletop play is simply not the same thing. When you're narrating your actions instead of actually doing them and rolling dice and eating chips that your character is not rolling and eating, then you're having a vastly different type of experience from the experience that lead to the term Immersion being coined.<br/><br/>You can be engaged. You can be making decisions from your character's perspective. You can relate to your character's emotions and feel them as your own. You can even do so to the point that you feel a flow state - loss of time, loss of sense of self, etc.<br/><br/>But it's different.<br/><br/>So it kind of bugs me that the term Immersion has been adopted by the tabletop community in the last couple of years.<br/><br/>Not that I'm saying I'm a hardcore larp immersionist. Cause I'm not. But the type of embodiment that lead to the development of the term is part of the difference between larp-style play and tabletop-style play. <br/><br/>It's a term from a different medium.<br/><br/>I guess it's like when we talk about scene framing in a story game. We know that scene framing is a term from cinema. And we know that we're translating that term into a different medium. So we know that the result is going to be something analogous but different.<br/><br/>But we treat it more like the term Focus in cinema and photography. Cinema and photography are different media, but Focus works pretty much exactly the same way, because still cameras and movie cameras handle light coming through lenses the same way. The only difference is that cinema can do a sliding focus - changing focus from background to foreground, for example - because cinema uses time as an additional factor that photography does not use.<br/><br/>But translating Immersion from larp to tabletop is more like translating scene framing from cinema to tabletop (as an interesting side note, scene framing doesn't really happen in most larp, because you can't count on the players having a shared perspective to frame from). It's analagous, but different.<br/><br/>And I think that leads to some of the complaints and disconnects. Some tabletop players want a larp-like immersion experience. They want to be their character all the time as much as possible. They don't want to think thoughts that aren't their character's thoughts more than maybe 5% of the time.<br/><br/>And I don't think that's an realistic expectation. I don't think it honors what is good about the tabletop medium (which differs from what is good about the larp medium).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320797/#Comment_320797" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T11:33:25+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 11:33AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, if there was a LIKE button I could press for your post, I would.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320800/#Comment_320800" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T11:49:16+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 11:49AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2011 12:14PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cy,<br/><br/>I'd really like to talk to you about what you posted. My concerns are:<br/><br/>a) It really starts leaving the concerns of this thread. (I know that's not a Story Games rules issue, it's just personal preference on my part.)<br/>b) It's actually the start of a huge conversation.<br/>c) I'm writing about these very issues in PLAY SORCERER right now, so I should probably be putting the time into that!<br/><br/>I'll say this about how I play:<br/><br/><i>There are characters. They want things. As the players have their characters move toward these things the other players at the table generate opportunities and obstacles, revelations and reversals. In the face of these things, the characters will make choices. As the choices are made, a story is created. <b>A story is the wake left by the characters as they talk and take action.</b></i><br/><br/>Even when I'm the GM (of filling in the GM role in a GM-less game) I don't think in terms of moving things "toward" story. I just think in terms of opportunities and obstacles, revelations and reversals. We know where we're moving toward as the players (both the GM and the other Players) have their characters make decisions about what to say or do. Each decision moves the story forward. And as decisions are made, we get a story.<br/><br/>Boom. That's it for me. Again, for me a story is found in the wake of what the characters do as they move forward in word and deed. There's no building toward anything planned ahead of time. No character is "set up" to be the Big Villain or Nemesis. We'll know who the Big Villain or a Nemesis is by how the the Players have their Player characters relate to the GM characters. That's it. If a Player decides "I'm going to kill that mutherfucker!" the by god, that mutherfucker is now a Nemesis. But I, as the GM or fellow Player, would never presume to think I could navigate or compel a Player to getting around to deciding that. A Player decides that on his own, if it happens at all, for reasons I could never have guessed or anticipated. For all I know the Player will have is Character ally with an NPC I was certain he'd be trying to kill. It happens -- and that kind of reversal is awesome and great storytelling.<br/><br/>For me, story isn't plot. It's the wake of the characters' forward motion. Now, different games have different rules and procedures for creating a crucible where this forward motion can make story. But that's where this conversation spins out into a book that's been driving me nuts for too long. Time to get back to it.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320802/#Comment_320802" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T11:53:55+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 11:53AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad you found it useful, Chris.<br/><br/>By the way, playing Sorcerer with you at Strategicon a few years ago was one of the most engaging roleplaying experiences I have had to date.

I don't just get to declare something and get it in <i>Sorcerer</i> or <i>Hero Wars</i> or <i>In A Wicked Age...</i>, etc. and it becomes so. I don't know where people get that assumption or why it persists. But if you think that's how these games work, <i>knock it off</i>. People declare what they're committed to doing in these games, and then we found out how strong that commitment is...]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320807/#Comment_320807" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T12:19:51+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 12:19PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2011 12:21PM by Paul88.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I'd like to throw in a history perspective wrench.</div>\n</blockquote>\nGreat post for making the obvious visible, clear as a picture!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our group immersion is desired but as you have shown in your post the limitations are obvious, maybe this will help get some perspective around are gaming table.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill print this off for discussion Thanks a gain for clear insight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320811/#Comment_320811" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T12:49:26+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 12:49PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2011 12:51PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>So it kind of bugs me that the term Immersion has been adopted by the tabletop community in the last couple of years.</blockquote>\nNitpick on the "couple of years":<br><br>I've been seeing the term 'immersion' in regular use for 13+ years.

Immersion was a word used in that discussion, but it wasn't <b>the</b> word, yet.<br/><br/>I suspect that it was around the time we started hearing Larpy stuff that it became <b>the</b> word; I would feel zero shock to learn that the timing was not-a-coincidence.  And I suspect that settling-of-terms was actually to our detriment, rather than our benefit.   I suspect this because it covers too much ground; what CK means by Immersion and what I do are not the same.   What you mean and I mean are likely not the same.  We can all be pointing at real things, but it's not truly clear which one any of us means.<br/><br/><i>This has been a rummage in my memory box, which is deeply fallible.</i><br/><br/>....<br/><br/>On the topic of why story-concerns are a distraction, given the presence of pizza and dice.<br/><br/>Getting into any kind of flow is like juggling.  Saying "what's one more ball, really?" is kind of an odd question.  I've played tabletop by the light of a oil lamp, with period cards, for a Victorian-era game.  And it often helps; a well-set mood is one less ball in the air.  The object is not to get rid of <b>all</b> the balls, just enough to be manageable - and anything that someone at the table perceives as a chainsaw probably shouldn't get tossed in to the act unannounced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320827/#Comment_320827" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T14:19:57+00:00" title="April 15, 2011  2:19PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2011 2:20PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, I think the culprit is just lazy speech.

And it a common mis-identification.<br/><br/>If, by immersion, you mean that you engage deeply enough in the activity that you reach the flow state, then the problem is with your flow state.<br/><br/>By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow">definition</a>, flow requires mastery-level performance of a challenging skill. What you are doing has to be difficult, and you have to be doing it well.<br/><br/>When you play a game that you've played for a long time, you're able to do the difficult stuff.<br/><br/>But when you switch to a new game, you struggle with the parts that are different. And this makes it difficult to obtain a flow state. With time and mastery, the flow state becomes obtainable again.<br/><br/>Rules don't break immersion. Unfamiliar rules that you have not mastered the use of break flow (which is generally considered a part of strongly experienced immersion).<br/><br/>The rules feel like they are breaking your immersion because you don't know them well enough to use them with mastery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320842/#Comment_320842" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T15:43:20+00:00" title="April 15, 2011  3:43PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tork</cite>No. They meant it the former sense, not the latter. rec.games.frp.advocacy initially used the term "Deep IC" to describe immersion, probably starting in '95 or so.

Here's what I put for it at the time.  \n<blockquote>   "immersion":  This is a term for trying to cut out all meta-game information and view things from the Point-of-View of your character (or for GM's just look at the game world facts).  It is associated with the "In-Character" stance -- see the next section below.</blockquote>\nThis was not influenced by any explicit larp play.  So I think the meaning has been pretty consistent since at least 1997.  <br/><br/>I also would note that there isn't a sharp line between larp and tabletop as a medium.  Yes, the typical tabletop has lots of narration and scene changes - but its not required by the medium.  You can play much more larp-like scenarios in tabletop, and the results can be quite good.

They are different, but related, medium of expression, the way that film and photography are. Film and photography both involve, at their core, capturing light as it moves through lenses. And they share elements, like concepts of foreground and background. But they have different strengths.<br/><br/>Yes, jeepform is an example of larp that foregoes some of the possibilities of larp to play up some of the strengths of tabletop. Likewise you can put an Ansel Adams photograph on a movie screen with a score behind it and it will still be a beautiful, moving photograph.<br/><br/>I think the biggest unique strength of larp is "simultaneous action" - having multiple independant things relating to the same game happening at the same time. The actual same time - not in succession, as you would have if you were jump-cutting between two scenes in a movie. A player is aware that something else is happening that they are not participating in, because they are participating in something else at that moment (again, not in a wait-your-turn narrative sense, but in the "those 2 folks are over there talking about something right now, but I'm over here doing this at the moment instead" sense).<br/><br/>And I think that simultaneous action is related to the difference between tabletop immersion and larp immersion.<br/><br/>In larp immersion, I can be acting out my character basically all the time for 48 hours straight. There is no turn-taking in the way scenes play out. I'm always being my character in whatever is going on. Other people are over there participating in a different scene while I'm over here participating in this one, with no turn-taking. I may be watching someone giving a speech, but I'm doing so as my character. If I'm not there to hear the speech, I just don't hear it.<br/><br/>In tabletop play, generally, I spend at least some of the time in audience mode while the GM is interacting with another player in the group. That audience time can be deeply engaging. But it's still audience time. It's time spent receiving someone elses story, rather than acting out my own. The scene can focus on someone else's action but I can still enjoy it as the audience. And I think this is a great strength of the tabletop medium.<br/><br/>I'm not denying that tabletop players can get deeply in character. That they can make decisions from their character's point of view. That they can experience emotions through their characters.

There is no turn-taking in the way scenes play out. I'm always being my character in whatever is going on. Other people are over there participating in a different scene while I'm over here participating in this one, with no turn-taking. I may be watching someone giving a speech, but I'm doing so as my character. If I'm not there to hear the speech, I just don't hear it.<br/><br/>In tabletop play, generally, I spend at least some of the time in audience mode while the GM is interacting with another player in the group. That audience time can be deeply engaging. But it's still audience time. It's time spent receiving someone elses story, rather than acting out my own. The scene can focus on someone else's action but I can still enjoy it as the audience. And I think this is a great strength of the tabletop medium.</blockquote>\nI'm fine that there are common differences - but you're suggesting that mixing up those differences is a bad thing that we shouldn't try for.  In my experience, mixing these two styles has had some great results.  Many jeepform games and others (like A Flower for Mara) are larp-like but don't have simultaneity.  There is only one scene, and players often drop into audience mode.  <br/><br/>Conversely, I don't think that it's a bad thing to have a tabletop game that has more continuous in-character play.  My favorite session of 1001 Nights, for example, was one where we all stayed in character continuously.  I think that is a strength of that game that I like to play up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320863/#Comment_320863" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T18:35:28+00:00" title="April 15, 2011  6:35PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2011 6:36PM by jenskot.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>You know what I find aids my immersion immensely?<br/><br/>Not needing to know the damn rules in order to play.<br/><br/>A lot of story-games as well as stuff like D&amp;D4e really require all of the players to understand the rules.

And it a common mis-identification.<br/><br/>If, by immersion, you mean that you engage deeply enough in the activity that you reach the flow state, then the problem is with your flow state.<br/><br/>By<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow">definition</a>, flow requires mastery-level performance of a challenging skill. What you are doing has to be difficult, and you have to be doing it well.<br/><br/>When you play a game that you've played for a long time, you're able to do the difficult stuff.<br/><br/>But when you switch to a new game, you struggle with the parts that are different. And this makes it difficult to obtain a flow state. With time and mastery, the flow state becomes obtainable again.<br/><br/>Rules don't break immersion. Unfamiliar rules that you have not mastered the use of break flow (which is generally considered a part of strongly experienced immersion).<br/><br/>The rules feel like they are breaking your immersion because you don't know them well enough to use them with mastery.<br/><br/>I just wanted to highlight this... great post!<br/><br/>In the D&amp;D edition wars, people who love D&amp;D 3E will complain about certain aspects of D&amp;D 4E as being too abstract and breaking immersion... but they have no problem with Hit Points. I've seen this come up a few times in seminars and often after a bit of back and forth, the answer turns into "we're used to Hit Points." <br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of D&amp;D 4E, so I don't say this to defend it. I just wanted to offer this as a supporting example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320883/#Comment_320883" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-16T00:43:26+00:00" title="April 16, 2011 12:43AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>More importantly to me, however, is that a <i>persistent immersion</i> (which I think is your assumption about what Immersion is when you write about it, though I might be wrong, but that's been my take away), simply is not a goal of any kind for me. I simply don't believe it can exist as a goal outside of very specific circumstances where almost hypnotic trances are employed. And I'm not saying there aren't people out there doing that. I'm saying I've never been involved in anything like that.<br/><br/>When I play, I assume the rhythms of play are going to be more like a baseball game. When the players are out in the field there a lot of standing -- a<i>lot</i>. And then the pitcher makes a move, and the players get into gear, leaning forward, backing up, getting ready, whatever. There's a pitch -- and maybe nothing happens and everyone relaxes again. Or there's a hit and everyone scrambles really fast.... and then... there's a lot of standing again.<br/><br/>That's how I see games working whenever I've played. People slipping into the intensity or point of view of their character, and then leaving again. Just because, you know, we're a bunch of people sitting at a table in modern day clothes eating pretzels and stuff.</blockquote>\nIt <i>blew my mind</i> when I went to Knutepunkt in 2009 and realized that there are folks for whom--as Rob suggests--character immersion is the <i>entire point</i> of the game, and for whom shuttling back-and-forth between IC and OOC perspectives is <i>bad form</i>; the paper by my friend Jiituomas that I cite above talks about this as well. And this attitude is really not totally restricted to larpers; if you go to therpgsite, you will discover a very vocal segment of tabletop gamers there who regard "story" in any form as antithetical to "true" roleplaying--anathema, even--since the point is for the GM to create a "world-in-motion" that players can just inhabit as their characters. You can talk about players' ability to "shift frames" all you want (and most of the <i>scholarship</i> on roleplaying does, citing sociologist Erving Goffman's seminal work on frames in order to do so), but there are folks for whom <i>the game itself</i> is about maintaining the "diegetic [i.e., fictional] frame." And you and I may both think they're kidding themselves--that there's <i>no way</i> they can possibly do it, or do it for long, but that's how they see play and they are indeed our people as well.<br/><br/>If you think about it, complete character immersion is just one end of a spectrum of possible approaches to the player/character duality; the other end is complete character elision. In other words, complete immersion implies that there is no player; it's all about the character for the duration of the game. Complete elision on the other hand implies that there is no character; there's just a player for whom "the character" is merely a diegetic extension. Some folks believe something along those lines; I've seen Luke Crane advance a notion to that effect on this board but I'm hard-pressed to find it now. Hell, that's the way that the 11-year-olds I'm running 4E for right now play D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Big Model "narrativism" does something funny, in that it occupies a middle ground on that spectrum. It advances the notion of "addressing Premise" in play, which Ron Edwards defines as (a) establishing the fictional presence of an "engaging issue or problematic feature of human existence" in the game, (b) developing that issue or feature as a "source of continued conflict," and (c) resolving the issue through the in-game actions of the players as protagonists. He goes on to say (emphasis added):\n<blockquote><cite>Ron Edwards says in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/narr_essay.html" rel="nofollow">Narrativism: Story Now</a></cite>Can it really be that easy? Yes, Narrativism is that easy. The Now refers to <i>the people, during actual play, focusing their imagination to create those emotional moments of decision-making and action, and paying attention to one another as they do it</i>. To do that, they relate to "the story" very much as authors do for novels, as playwrights do for plays, and screenwriters do for film at the creative moment or moments. . . . There cannot be any "the story" during Narrativist play, because to have such a thing (fixed plot or pre-agreed theme) is to remove the whole point: the creative moments of addressing the issue(s). Story Now has a great deal in common with Step On Up, particularly in the social expectation to contribute, but in this case <i>the real people's attention is directed toward one another's insights toward the issue</i>, rather than toward strategy and guts.</blockquote>\n<br/>Notice how that description implies action both <i>in the fiction</i> and <i>at the table</i>, which is what I was talking about when I said that GNS narrativism "works by having one stand in a kind of alienation or distance from the character one plays in order to more strongly appreciate the moral weight of the decisions the character makes." The idea that GNS gamism explores the "negative space" of GNS narrativism also pops out in that description.<br/><br/>In any event, "just playing your character" (or "just playing the game") turns out to be just part of what's required; you have to be able to appreciate or assess your participation and that of others from the perspective of a player of a game. This idea emerges very powerfully here:\n<blockquote><cite>Ron Edwards says in <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=24.0" rel="nofollow">All-out dissection (LONG AND BRUTAL)</a></cite>Paul [Czege] and I are now thinking that Simulationism is NOT an actual outlook or goal, unlike Narrativism or Gamism. Nor is it a "design dial," as many have suggested. <br/><br/>No, we think that Simulationism is a form of retreat, denial, and defense against the responsibilities of either Gamism or Narrativism. These two outlooks acknowledge, even require Author stance, and they acknowledge the potential of personal failure in role-playing. The Gamist can lose. The Narrativist can look on the results and say, "That story stunk, and it was my fault." <br/><br/>Paul and I have decided to propose that Simulationism consists entirely of a retreat from these dangers. Paul suggests . . . that such role-players are proto-Narrativists, whereas I think it's basically a blind retreat with a lot of possible causes.</blockquote>\nThis also illustrates the point I was trying to make in the blog about simulationism (which I take to include approaches to play that value immersion of all sorts as one or another kind of "Exploration") looking pathological from the perspective of the Big Model.<br/><br/>You shouldn't take anything I've said here as challenging your discussion of your own experience; I'm just trying to situate that experience within a broader universe of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320885/#Comment_320885" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-16T02:20:14+00:00" title="April 16, 2011  2:20AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2011 2:20AM by Dave Hallett.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't find the argument about "immersion as misplaced from LARPing" very convincing.

ClintonRNixons post seemed more right to me, from that dissection thread.<br/><br/>For instance, I dont think Ron gets the things that people enjoy about a game like D&amp;D at all.  He has identified one or two things that the 'space aliens' seem to enjoy, and then arbitrarily decided that they are the most important for everybody he has slapped the 'gamist' label on.  One of Rons favorite words is synecdoche and I certainly think he has committed that with his treatise on gamists, and probably GNS as a whole.<br/><br/>With his label 'narrativism' which is 'consistantly addressing theme'.  Well, a lot of indie games are 'about something'.  They do have a premise, and if the game is well designed, you cant really play it without addressing the premise because everything about the game, from the characters, the situation, the types of problems and resolution mechanics it provides... all conspire to ram the premise down your throat whether you consider yourself a narativist or not.   <br/><br/>But other games arent specifically 'about something' in the same way.  To consistently address a theme in those types of game, the players would have to actively and overtly conspire to do so in a way which to me would seem highly contrived.  Those types of games might just be about the promise of drama and action in a cool setting, like Apocalypse World for instance.  <br/><br/>I guess what Im trying to say is that trying to identify yourself under one of these three arbitrary labels is a bit pointless.  System _does_ matter, in as much as a well designed game will deliver on whatever aspects of play it has been designed for.  And individuals certainly have a preference for certain aspects of play -- they will choose games that deliver those aspects for them.  (or maybe they will just select the games their friends like, most of all)<br/><br/>A particular person might enjoy a range of aspects that spread across all three GNS labels, and a particular game might employ a similar  range of aspects.  And for specific players and designers, the aspects which are most important to them might not be the ones that Ron has selected as being the most important for his three categories.  In my opinion at least, he has certainly blundered with 'step on up' for  'gamist' players.<br/><br/>I also think a lot of the confusion comes from players not really being  critically self aware about identifying exactly which aspects they like, and the same for designers of games who either arent really aware and/or arent able to support their desired aspects properly.  And theres a lot of ignorance about how many aspects of play there are even available.  A lot of players roleplay the way their friends taught them to and so on, and thats just all there is to roleplaying from their perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320891/#Comment_320891" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-16T06:35:08+00:00" title="April 16, 2011  6:35AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2011 6:49AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, you've won me over.<br/><br/>I might quibble and say I'd rephrase your sentence as, "works by having one <i>alternating between deep identification with the character and then</i> standing in a kind of alienation or distance from the character one plays in order to more strongly appreciate the moral weight of the decisions the character makes."

Let me say I came back to this after two busy days and found it exploded.  As far as I am concerned this post is full of win and gives me a lot to think about.  There are some amazing cogent points (and thanks Chris, specifically, for bearing the torch <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> and it really will allow me to think about immersions role in GNS.   While some points come in clear there is something just not jiving.<br/><br/>I'm going to read more posts and links and more on the topic and brush up on the Big Model and talk about this again tonight or Monday (tomorrow is dedicated to Apocalypse World and A Game of Thrones).<br/><br/>One thing I will comment on is this.  Immersion did not originate from LARPing.  We were talking about immersive performance based play far before 1990. In fact immersion butt heads with Gamism for a decade before LARPs really hit the scene en force.  Roll-play vs role-play was a a conflict we've been chattering about since we started rolling dice and yes, we called it immersion.<br/><br/>I think a few statements in support of my hypothesis (and I think Chris understands the intention of my discussion but Bill, David and Jonathan certainly are spot on in asking me to be more consistent with the language) is at the core of my practical use of immersion as a play style/play mode).  I'm not talking about the holy Grail of immersion.  I'm not talking about plugged and and don't let go until the GM closes the curtain.  I think there are natural breaks in immersive play (most pointedly in relation to in game conversations).  <br/><br/>I am going to belly laugh (in a good way) if I find the really key to my argument is in the head of a cognitive psychologist or some such non-sense.<br/><br/>Look, I know I'm stirring up old wounds and part of the discussion is to get people talking about this to help me put certain pieces together.  To hope we all are willing to look at something, hopefully, a little differently then we had.  This moment of hubris (and I am a cocky motherfucker who's been doing this a long time *wink*) ends with descent scholarship and theoretical thought thoroughly rounding out the anecdotal.
