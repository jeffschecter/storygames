I understand that the setting had plenty of Romantic Fantasy tropes, and I recall some solid advice about how the character arc differs from your standard "action hero mythic journey" and what characters can do besides kill stuff and the sort of emotion-centric buy-in that everyone at the table needs to have, but beyond that, it was pretty much D&amp;D (and we didn't have any sailing or pirates).  That is, you could take the advice from the book and pretty much just use D&amp;D.  Mechanically there's little in there to encourage or promote Romantic Fantasy beyond what any other game offers.<br/><br/>Somebody will probably come along and point out something I missed, but that's how I remember it.  I guess that means that I shouldn't have suggested it, but it does have a lot of advice on how they think you should play a Romantic Fantasy RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maltese_Changeling" title="Maltese_Changeling"><img alt="Maltese_Changeling" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maltese_Changeling">Maltese_Changeling</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243563/#Comment_243563" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T20:31:34+00:00" title="November 24, 2009  8:31PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect a lot of the disconnect comes from author John Snead's intense dislike of personality mechanics and other story game devices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243576/#Comment_243576" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T22:37:15+00:00" title="November 24, 2009 10:37PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played it despite reading it through several times, specifically because I couldn't see anything in it that lent itself to romantic fantasy play other than the constant head-beating that it was SUPPOSED to be romantic fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243582/#Comment_243582" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T23:13:28+00:00" title="November 24, 2009 11:13PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blue Rose gave you all the pieces for romantic (and swashbuckling) fantasy, but it assumed that you already knew what romantic fantasy was about and would put those pieces together the right way, a lot like a generic game in that respect.<br/><br/>Romance is hugely problematic in most published games, if it exists at all, which normally it doesn't, which is almost as problematic as screwing it up.

It's all about dancing, conversations, etiquette, gossiping, social and political alliances, and flirting (of course). The characters can be declared "social dead", but no physical death is possible (all duels are as much a duel of wits as of swords).<br/><br/>My idea is that "mechanics" don't suffice in making a great game of dramatic interaction, so I gave <i>Romanse!</i> a <i>method </i>(mechanics AND storytelling/leadership in balance, with hard rules for both) that really help the players into the romantic mood and moves. The lack of violent solutions is one of the premises in it. Wanton murder is a killer for romantic notions, so I kicked it out. Defining dancing and conversations,  and other central interactions, as tough conflicts with hard consequences of skill-use is another premise. No need to <i>fight </i>for excitement, when <i>dancing </i>gives it to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243632/#Comment_243632" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-25T08:05:47+00:00" title="November 25, 2009  8:05AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2009 8:08AM by Peter_Aronson.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_fantasy" rel="nofollow">Romantic Fantasy</a> \u2260 Romance, per se.

Anyway, in preparation for it I got myself a Mercedes Lackey book for cheap, read it to confirm my old prejudice (and add some new ones!) and then made pre-gens for my game. All in all it turned out pretty good, but as you say, I wouldn't contribute it the system in any way. Most important was probably talking about the tone and feel of the game/the session before hand:"It's kinda Disney actually, but without the silly and more melodrama..." (or something along those lines)<br/><br/>When I made my pre-gens I took a look at what generated Mary-Sue points and put as much of that in there as I dared, right down to basing all the characters names off of my own and having everyone look younger than they actually were (which culminated in Wilhelm claiming that his 30 year old lady noble, leader of the group, only looked about 15...!).<br/><br/>All in all I'd say it was a pretty decent stab at the genre, which it wouldn't have been if there was no player buy-in. Basically it's just like the old "anime game" discussion: it wasn't romantic fantasy through system at all really, it was romantic fantasy 'cause we said so and tried to follow the norms of the style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243709/#Comment_243709" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-25T12:59:59+00:00" title="November 25, 2009 12:59PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!
