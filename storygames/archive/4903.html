Doors open at 9.00pm, first games start at 10.00am. We'll finish at 11.00pm.<br/>\n<br/>\n(We'll be doing another on 27 September 2008 at the same times.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>WHAT?</b><br/>\nAny roleplaying or board game. You want to play it, bring it along and run it. Previously we've had on offer Amber, Call of Cthulhu, Cold City, Dogs in the Vineyard, GURPS Banestorm, Gwenthia, HeroQuest, Mythic Russia, Primetime Adventures, Savage Worlds, Tekumel, Transhuman Space, True20, Vampire, and some more that I've forgotten. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow" rel="nofollow">Latest updates will be posted on our website</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nA full list of games on offer is on the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow games page</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>WHO'LL BE THERE?</b><br/>\n<b>Mike Mason</b> will be our Guest of Honour at Concrete Cow 08. He's been a great friend of Concrete Cow in the past, helping out behind the scenes. He's also the Manager of <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.blackindustries.com/" rel="nofollow">Black Industries</a> (the RPG arm of Games Workshop) and the man behind the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.yog-sothoth.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=24" rel="nofollow">Kult of Keepers</a> (that group of mad people who run games of Call of Cthulhu). He's currently working on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.blackindustries.com/?template=40k" rel="nofollow">Dark Heresy</a>, the RPG set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. That'll be released in February 08, just in time for Concrete Cow 08! Mike will be chained to a table all day and forced to run games of Dark Heresy.<br/>\n<br/>\nRepresentatives of the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.yog-sothoth.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=242" rel="nofollow">Kult of Keepers</a> will be in attendance so expect plenty of top quality Call of Cthulhu.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany members of the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/" rel="nofollow">Collective Endeavour</a>, a coterie of UK Indie RPG designers, will be coming along too. That means you can expect all sorts of indie RPG goodness, if that's the sort of thing that floats your boat.

Here's a couple of updates.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite the news that Black Industries will be closing down soon, <b>Mike Mason</b> has confirmed that he'll be turning up as our Guest of Honour at Concrete Cow.  He'll be bringing along some games of Dark Heresy.  If you want to play in a Dark Heresy game with an employee of Black Industries, this could be your last chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trader House Atreides will be along with all sorts of RPGs and stuff in an attempt to part you from your money.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Loz Whitaker</b>, our other Guest of Honour, will be running a game of Planetary, a modern day superhero game.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><b>Planetary - 21st Century Threads</b><br/>\n<br/>\n2007 and it is a quiet time for <b>The Planetary Foundation</b>. Excavations continue into the secret history of the world but nothing has been heard of The Four for over two years. Whilst the multiverse is never safe, for the time being reality is unthreatened.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's intriguing <b>Elijah Snow</b> and the Planetary Field Team (<b>Jakita Wagner</b>, <b>The Drummer</b> and new addition, <b>Luther Arkwright</b>) is the appearance in New York of four of the wealthiest individuals in the world: Gil Bates, creator of the Portals operating system; Warren Dining, Wall Street investor with an uncanny ability to predict the global economic markets; Ms Anna Hark, president of the Hark Corporation and Guardian of the Rising Sun; and Karl Albrecht, retail mogul known as 'All the World's Grocer'. Intel suggests that these four billionaires are gathering for some form of summit - but no one knows why or what the repercussions might be.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlanetary's job is to find out what these four disparate individuals need to discuss so urgently - and why have they arranged to arrive in New York in complete secrecy (so secret, that even the CIA, FBI and STORM are unaware of the conference)?<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Planetary - 21st Century Threads</i> is a scenario based on Warren Ellis's <i>Planetary</i> graphic novel series. Each character is possessed of superhuman capablities and, together, they are Archaeologists of the Impossible, delving into the secret history of the world in order to preserve both humanity and reality from threat. For those unfamiliar with the graphic novels, a summary can be found at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~rkkman/frames/" rel="nofollow">http://home.earthlink.net/~rkkman/frames/</a>. In essence, think League of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets The X-Files, Marvel and DC superhero universes, with Michael Moorcock and Neil Gaiman as the godparents. As this is a convention scenario, expect a few extra spins on the traditional Planetary themes, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game system being used is Chaosium's Basic Roleplaying and the scenario is for up to 4 players.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nFull details of Concrete Cow are on the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow web page</a>.

Here are a couple of updates.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, confirmation of the games being offered by our Guests of Honour:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Loz Whitaker, using Chaosium BR</b>: <i>Planetary - 21st Century Threads</i><br/>\n<br/>\nA scenario based on Warren Ellis's 'Planetary' graphic novel series. Each character is possessed of superhuman capabilities and, together, they are Archaeologists of the Impossible, delving into the secret history of the world in order to preserve both humanity and reality from threat. In essence, think League of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets The X-Files, Marvel and DC superhero universes, with Michael Moorcock and Neil Gaiman as the godparents. As this is a convention scenario, expect a few extra spins on the traditional Planetary themes, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Mike Mason, using Call of Cthulhu</b>: <i>When the Wind Blows</i>:<br/>\n<br/>\nNo Blurb. No Blurb. No Blurb. Dare to play?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Mike Mason, using Dark Heresy</b>: <i>The House of Dust &amp; Ashes</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAs Acolytes of the Holy Inquisition, you will face many tests, many dangers and you may come to question just what you are fighting for; are you truly arm of the Emperor, or simply pawns in the great game? A Rogue Trader's estate brought to auction is just the thing to draw out all a cobweb of shadows and heresy, and you shall be there with the net to catch all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Loz Whitaker, in Gwenthia:</b> <i>One Tree Hill</i><br/>\n<br/>\nA scenario set in the shared world of Gwenthia, as showcased at previous Concrete Cows. The characters are the esteemed crew of 'Not Here, Not Now' - a rag-tag assortment of Tharuxi[1] ne'er do wells who have been living on the wrong side of the Tharuxi Code for just a little too long.<br/>\nThe scenario uses the Mongoose RuneQuest game engine as its base, coupled with unique rules for magic. The scenario is for up to six players and no prior knowledge of Gwenthia is required.<br/>\n[*]Think Rastafarian steam-punk mechanics who always travel as a troupe and worship a myriad of highly potent alien ancestors, and you're on the right track...<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, <b>Mike Mason</b> will be at Concrete Cow as a Guest of Honour, despite the imminent closure of Black Industries.  Come along if you want to grab one of the last few chances to play with official Black Industries staff, or just commiserate with him and buy him a pint.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are loads of other great games on offer.  If you're thinking of offering a game, let me know and I'll put it on the website.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook forward to seeing you all in sunny Milton Keynes on the 8th!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130753/#Comment_130753" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T03:27:56+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  3:27AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another update!
