It was fun! But a couple of rules questions came up.\n<ol>\n<li>If you attempt a task for which you have a zero-rated skill, what dice do you select as outcome? Attribute 3, Skill 1 means pick the first and third dice, Attribute 1, Skill 1 means pick the first die twice, but would Attribute 3 Skill 0 mean pick the third die only?</li>\n<li>Following on from that, can you apply a Demotion to reduce a skill to zero?</li>\n<li>And finally, how do you handle multi-way conflicts, or conflicts where the participants have orthogonal goals?</li></ol>\nTo illustrate the last question, last night we had a situation where the PC engineer was shooting the Etheric Concentrator, to prevent it falling into 'enemy' hands, the colonial rebels were attacking the PC engineer to disable him, and the diplomat PC was getting between the other two, to calm down the situation. How do you handle that in a FLFS conflict?<br/><br/>I ended up doing something Sorcerer-like. I worked out who was opposing whom (unopposed actions got a static target number). Everyone rolled at once, and the highest total got their objective. Working down the totals, people got their objectives is none of their opponents got a higher total.<br/><br/>Was that the right way to do it? If not, what should I have been doing?<br/><br/>(Edited for formatting)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
