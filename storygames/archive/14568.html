On one hand it talks about a system that generates a story essentially whole cloth, and then talks about how you associate specks and pieces of the game having to "free associate" and not mattering what you say. The only way I can see to reconcile those two is to say that the system is in some ways constrained and in some ways free to player input, but remains "gamey". Really the only two conditions that don't seem multi-valent are "little" and "fun". So certainly this includes any RPG that isn't long form or just plan unfun. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331678/#Comment_331678" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T08:41:06+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  8:41AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've seen that quote before?

I myself usually call games like this "formalistic" as part of my greater rpg theory scheme, but the basic trend is the same: building a game where the primary levers the players pull are mechanical, and where the primary gauges they read are likewise mechanical. The promise of such a game is that you can remove the historically problematic evaluation of fiction from the game, or move it around, or qualify it in ways that make it less prone to malfunction. Ultimately, taken to an extreme, the promise is that you can make a game where the participants do not need to have a creative urge nor communication skills, but rather they'll be able to play the game merely by moving playing pieces around. What actually happens, however, is that mechanization disassociates the players from the fiction of the game.<br/><br/>The thing to realize is that this is not a discrete thing, but rather a quality of play and design philosophy, a continuum that individual games may be positioned on. The reason for why we might want to qualify the quantity by categorizing some games as "story games" is that the last decade has seen a strong trend towards seeing formalism as an ideal of design: the more formalistic the better. This isn't an universal ideal, of course, but it's easily evident among indie designers, Forge-influenced designers, inexperienced designers and competition design. In truth, however, it's ultimately misleading to try to draw an invisible line beyond which lies "story game" (I use quotation marks here because I rather disagree with this usage of the term) territory: the best we can say is that this game is further along the continuum from purely realistic game to a purely formalistic one.<br/><br/>Assuming you accept my characterization of the phenomenon as a continuum, I'm more than happy to discuss specific games as examples of the phenomenon:\n<ul><li><em>My Life with Master</em> was an extremely radical design in 2003 in this regard, and much of its notorierity was because of how it was built: play progressed in turns around the table, there were a limited number of different scene types you needed to use to categorize all fiction and so on. It would not be far-fetched to consider the discussion until 2006 or so about how to play the game to have been predicated on the exact question of how much is too much formalism, and where does the heart of roleplaying lie: evidently people were getting great mileage out of the game, evidently it generated organic fiction that was accepted in play and taken seriously despite the fact that you could count on one hand's fingers the occasions in the game's process where the players were required to directly query the fiction on anything; you could have played MLwM from start to finish in pig latin as long as there were some hand-signals for communicating scene framing and conflict junctures. MLwM was and is a great example of a game that is very far to the formalistic side of system philosophy while also enabling a very functional and real experience of play.</li><li><em>Under the Bed</em> is one of the ample range of games that got its inspiration from MLwM; it's also highly formalistic with its player turns, scheduled dramatic arc and so on. I mention it here because it's perhaps the first published game that I think fits Ron's critique well: I have found it a relatively common experience that you can play through UtB with a quite reasonable interpretation of the game's text, chugging along, all without ever finding creative concord or even creative discord with the other players. It's a scheduled train to story-ville, fill-in-the-blanks storytelling, you can just put in your piece when it's your turn and the game will go on whatever you say, no matter whether the other players acknowledge your contribution on any level. Of course good play has been achieved (I've had it myself as well), but that has much more to do with the group's insistence to touch bases creatively than what the game is doing; unlike MLwM, I've found it very easy to play through UtB without caring one whit of the contributions of anybody at the table, myself included.</li></ul>\nI'll stop listing examples here, actually, as I think it's useful to emphasize that as discussed above, I think that categorizing games discretely in this way is quite bogus: we can say that UtB is "more story game" than MLwM, but what we really mean is that it's excessive amount of formalistic solutions combined with its way of handling creative agenda disassociates it from the fiction of play, causing this story automata phenomenon. ("Story Automaton", I like that term much more.) Because I mentioned "creative agenda" here, that's a hint that we are discussing a somewhat subjective phenomenon here: take a group that wants real play and is compassionate about the topic, and you'll get that out of UtB as well. It's like this: the disassociation I mention above is a gap between the players and the fiction, but a group with sufficient passion and focus in what they're doing will be able to bridge that gap. For this reason we should be talking about a tendency towards creative disassociation, not about categories that games fit into.<br/><br/>Moving along, let's assume that you accept my point here: UtB is not a "story game", it just has a higher level of disassociation, which increases its propensity of acting in play like Ron describes, like a story automaton. Other games with comparatively high levels of fictive disassociation are <i>Contenders</i> (I've myself disassociated with this one despite best efforts), <i>Blood &amp; Bronze</i> (unfair, it's really a boardgame), <i>Breaking the Ice</i> (<b><i>very</i></b> functional, but there're plenty of people who disassociate with it), <i>Serial Homicide Unit</i> (just a bit, should play it to find out more), <i>Sons of Liberty</i> (ditto), <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, <i>Acts of Evil</i>, <i>A Penny for My Thoughts</i>, <i>Death's Door</i>, <i>S/lay w/Me</i>, <i>It's Complicated</i>... I would name more, but this phenomenon is at its most striking in game competitions and throw-away designs, and who can remember all those. As I've tried to emphasize, of course, this phenomenon is relative - the above is not a list of bad games, just a list of games that I believe are somewhat more prone to this "story automatonism" than your average game. In general you'll find that a game that actually gets published will almost always be playable without story automatonism for <i>somebody</i> - I've only ever met a couple of game designers who intentionally created a story automaton, so I have to conclude that most people quite genuinely believe their games capable of fostering creative cooperation. Like, Zombie Cinema - I can say that it definitely works for me in general, but I've also had bad days with it, and so have others; it would be quite unfair to call it a story automaton or story game just because it requires a slightly higher level of commitment to the fiction than <i>Runequest</i> to maintain focus where it belongs. It's a legitimate design tradeoff.<br/><br/>I would also like to remind everybody that leaning towards formalism has its reasons: it's a very effective way to combat "murk", as Ron calls difficulties in positioning and procedure. I'm not surprised at all that it's been so popular over the last decade as a design direction, we've all been hugely excited by the whole idea of finally having procedural roleplaying game texts that you can actually use without investing huge amounts of GM-effort on pacing and such issues. I agree with Ron that there's a trend towards disassociative failure in this direction, although I don't think that it's a discrete class of games we're discussing - just the fact that taking a game too far out of the fiction will, predictably, disassociate the players and leave them non-caring, spouting arbitrary stuff just because they can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331684/#Comment_331684" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T09:20:16+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  9:20AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>I assume he's mostly taking a shot at the Tales of the Arabian Nights board game</blockquote>\nAha!

This has the benefit of making the game "work" even when the players aren't agreeing 100% in the fiction, making it more "robust". It also has the downside of making it feel like "the fiction doesn't matter", for the same reason.<br/><br/>It's a continuum, for which each game (and each group) will find its own sweet spot.<br/><br/>My personal interpretation is that Ron is seeing *too many* of these games (after all, as far as I know, he's quite fond of My Life with Master), and thus wanted to say something about the trend. <br/><br/>I see Apocalypse World, incidentally, as a game that is in many ways a reaction to this trend, trying to get back to more traditional methods of structuring the rules and the fiction. But it also has some much more "automaton-esque" rules, like the way you receive experience, for example: you mark experience simply when you make certain rolls, which is a reliable marker which you can track and follow even if you have no idea if what's happening in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331703/#Comment_331703" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T11:49:15+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 11:49AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I think yours is the best articulation of this particular design phenomenon I've read to date.

On the other hand, as with most games, it is possible to shoehorn in great moments of play in spite of the formula.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331707/#Comment_331707" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T12:32:04+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 12:32PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly, Tim - and I would nitpick some of those examples as well, that's a pretty arbitrary list off the top of my head. The basic point is, you don't get that empty ritualistic fiction unless the players lose their commitment, and <i>that</i> requires a mechanical framework that is robust enough to maintain the superficial formalities of play even then. We don't get this same problem in traditional games or other realist (as opposite of formalist, you understand) games, as those will simply not proceed without a certain mutual commitment to the fiction - there's no flowchart telling you whose turn it is next or anything, so you <i>can't</i> continue the game without a discourse, no matter how dysfunctional. This is often actually cited as a feature of a formalist design, I do it myself as well: sometimes it's socially very useful to have a game that is nigh impossible to derail. For groups that suffer of inability to keep on track and finish games, even a tool that gives them a very pro forma game experience can be an enlightening thing if it only allows them to at least finish a game this one time formally successfully. I know that sounds lame, but at least I regularly meet people for whom a formalistic style game is heaven-sent exactly because it's a superior tool for coordinating and cleaning up play that tends to derail in a more middle-of-the-road system. It can also be useful socially, and it should be remembered that some people are genuinely satisfied by just getting to play at storytelling a bit, with no deeper interaction; I know at least one designer who intentionally writes games like this.<br/><br/>But then, I also totally, definitely agree that we get too much of a good thing now and then, both in number of separate game texts and in individual games that would have been stronger if they had been allowed to breathe more. Apocalypse World, as mentioned by Paul, is an excellent example of how Vincent's addressed the topic; my own attempts with Solar System are a similar effort in showing a way in between an organic fiction and robust, systematic mechanics. I don't really think that a beginning designer who errs to the side of excess formalism is any worse off than the beginning designer who turns out yet another "here's a skill list, a dicing mechanic and a topic, go play" design, though. It's all just part of this craft that we all need to discover and match to what we actually want to do in the medium.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331708/#Comment_331708" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T12:43:15+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 12:43PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco is exactly the type of game he's describing.<br/><br/>* Roll some dice, then pair them off with random list elements.<br/>* Invent what those list elements really mean.<br/>* Each scene, choose: either you push some black &amp; white tokens around on the table, or you let everyone else.<br/>* You can strategize towards collecting all white tokens or all black tokens, but the game plays the same if you don't.<br/>* At the end, roll the dice in front of you.

You can probably count me as a formalist designer. I have been struggling with how to talk about this very issue for some time and I think your pretty close to framing it right.<br/><br/>You mention some good points about how formalist principles can help and some of the challenges playing by formula can have. I think other types of play (board games, wargames, sports) also deal with formula and judgement. Games like apples to apples use player judgement, figure skating is a sport entirely based on judgment, yet with elements of formula (limited time, various judging and point schemes). <br/><br/>So is this a formula Vs judgment thing? are the games talked about in that initial quote formulaic as opposed to other games that require more judgment calls? I don't think either is better I think each serves a different purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331746/#Comment_331746" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T17:02:57+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  5:02PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mostly agree with Eero, but would suggest further that the "formulist / structuralist / genre emulation through mechanics" swath of indie game design and play is just one of a series of themes that often contend and intermix with each other (which I suspect Eero would also agree with).  I don't think it's best thought of as a continuum, though, since individual games can't easily be ranked on a scale from "formalist &lt;---&gt; non-formalist." Take something like Ribbon Drive for example.  On the one hand, very open-ended and exploratory, very little in the way of resolution (drawing on another design theme, I think), but, on the other hand, it's also highly structured by the roadtrip, scene framing, the questions, epilogues, etc.  <br/><br/>The trends that make up the "design ethos" of this indie roleplaying community (if that can even be said to exist at all) are often combined in seemingly contradictory fashions or in ways that seem contentious.  Many of the more fruitful and interesting designs don't stick solely to one meme or style of design but combine a bunch of different, even contradictory elements and still get them to work together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331747/#Comment_331747" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T17:09:40+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  5:09PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's just a strawman thing that Ron's invented to argue a point.<br/><br/>I say this with all respect to him.

And as Simon says, it's a very basic part of game design analytics; I myself have been thinking in these terms for years at this point when trying to figure out how a given game should or shouldn't work. Do I want the players to query the fiction at this point in the game? How do they evaluate it, does some specific player make the call? Can I rely on the game having a solid enough fiction at this point in play for the players to have a consensus on this matter? Is it likely that this thing the mechanics want to know will actually be as yet unestablished, so that I need to name a player who'll have to narrate it into being at the appropriate time? It's quite useful to look into your design in terms of how and when it queries the fiction. If it only rarely does, then it's a formalist design; if it does often and its very structure relies on the answers the players drag from the fiction, then it's realist in form.<br/><br/>I haven't read Fiasco yet, but I do know <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, which I think is a pretty typical functional (I think so anyway, eh) formalist design in many ways. In that game the overridingly most important spot in the procedure for fiction to make a showing is in how the players negotiate who is going to conflict against whom: the game progresses by default without conflicts, and nothing much happens in the game mechanically without them, but the players have the freedom to position their characters in the fiction in a way that enables them to have conflicts. This single touch-point between the fiction and the mechanics keeps the entire game together, as ZC has pretty solid tools for judging conflicts for their worth, and it allows everybody to participate in all conflicts. Because of the conflict mechanics the fictional positioning of the characters matters in Zombie Cinema: is your character in the scene, is he expected to back up this other guy who's getting into trouble, what will he actually do in this crisis situation, and so on.<br/><br/>As a comparison <i>Under the Bed</i> is very similar in procedural ways, but there's a key difference: in UtB the game's procedure relies on every scene having conflict; in fact, the definition of the scene in that game is pretty much that you play on freeform until you get a conflict, after which it's the next player's turn. Nothing moves in UtB without conflicts, the game cannot progress and end without them. This is a formalist solution to pacing the game, and using it has those drawbacks: the fiction matters less to the procedures of play because you're going to end up in a conflict anyway no matter how you position things, and there's no choice between going to a conflict or not going to a conflict. On the other hand, it's simpler and cleaner architecture that helps an unorganized group remember what a scene is <i>for</i>.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that the way ZC keeps the game on course without relying on conflicts to happen by clockwork is necessarily superior in all contexts to UtB's enforced conflict schedule. It's just a thing, and I'm absolutely certain that Joshua specifically wanted to push the envelope towards automaton design when he was writing UtB. In hindsight I think that it's a weakness in the game, making it less fun to play and more prone to the issues we've been discussing, but at the time it was a fresh, bold move. ZC is a more recent game in the same tradition, so no wonder if I put on the breaks a bit and tried to seek a more balanced position to be in.<br/><br/>And of course I agree with Jonathan in that this just one feature of design, albeit a striking one. When people think of "Forge design", one of the first features that comes up under some name is that we've been pushing the envelope towards "more boardgame-y" games like it's often expressed: formalist games that rely on explicit structural rules in preference to allowing the fiction to wander. It's a historical trend and a feature of the local design culture. I wouldn't try to rank individual games as more or less formalist, either, except in very rough terms like I do with ZC and UtB, above: as both of those are simple games and very similar to each other, it's easy to say that the biggest difference between them happens to be about formalism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331794/#Comment_331794" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T23:30:00+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 11:30PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2011 11:31PM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thread, lots to think about.

It's all just part of this craft that we all need to discover and match to what we actually want to do in the medium.</blockquote>\nThis hits home for me. I'm designing this game right now (<a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=497&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">thread at Praxis</a>), and I've been totally worried about erring to the side of excess formalism (without having the language to express that until now); it's probably why I started this thread, because I wondered if <i>my</i> game was the type of game Ron was talking about. Now, though, I can know better what choices I'm making and why--why formalism, or why realism. Though those terms are still a bit hazy to me (sometimes I think I am the slowest person in the world when it comes to rpg theory); are there any other discussions of these terms anywhere else, Eero?<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>It's just a strawman thing that Ron's invented to argue a point.<br/><br/>I say this with all respect to him. That's how he argues. But, when he talks about cute little wind-up games, there's no point asking which game he means. He doesn't mean any game. He's making an argument.</blockquote>\nHa, of course this is also a possibility. Though whether or not Ron invented a strawman, what Eero et. al. are saying is making a lot of sense to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331819/#Comment_331819" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T05:54:44+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  5:54AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's of course possible that Ron's speaking of something entirely different - I don't have a special line on his ideas or anything.

Everything is tied in some way to something that happens in the fiction.<br/><br/>However, taken in isolation, the experience rules would work strictly "formally" even if the players of the game screwed up and, say, forgot to "do it when you do it". The experience rule is very clear and easy to follow because it says, "mark experience whenever you roll+hot". No question of getting that wrong, is there? Now consider if the rule was, instead, "Mark experience whenever you play a scene in which your character's sex appeal plays a role". That would be more "realist" design (in Eero's terms), and I expect we would run into situations where we might disagree if that was the rule.<br/><br/>That's the strength of formalist design right there: no ambiguity about how to apply it at the table. When playing Apocalypse World, you and I are *never* going to have to stop the game to argue about whether I should be marking experience right now or not.* <br/><br/><br/>* At least insofar as the basic mechanism is concerned, anyway: some of the moves may complicate this a little.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332098/#Comment_332098" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T12:58:40+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 12:58PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>I think Ron's using hyperbole here (and this is said to Jason, too).

This isn't an universal ideal, of course, but it's easily evident among indie designers, Forge-influenced designers, inexperienced designers and competition design.</blockquote>\nThis leads me to wonder: why is formalistic design more prevalent among inexperienced designers, etc.?<br/><br/>I've tinkered with design before, but as I linked upthread, I'm working on a game right now that I really think might see the light of day, and it's very formalistic. After reading your post, Eero, I wondered about that, and about if I can make my game less formalistic, or make it so we have to judge the fiction more. And I can't. That seems <i>really</i> hard. In contrast, my current formalistic design came out over the course of a couple days, with not a lot of pain. I just set up the game and it goes.<br/><br/>I'm a little worried about that, and a little not. I'm deciding whether to throw it all away or just make it the way it is, because it <i>will</i> work as a game*, the way I want it to, even if sometimes people will dissociate from it.<br/><br/><br/>*Or an exercise? Something super-formalistic seems more like a collaborative story exercise than a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nocker" title="Nocker"><img alt="Nocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://sites.google.com/site/angrynocker/_/rsrc/1306682518924/jdr/images.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nocker">Nocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332194/#Comment_332194" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T02:29:30+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  2:29AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite>I love it!

This particular school of design and theory in which this type of design approach is prevalent has been growing quickly over the last decade. Additionally, a characteristic of the movement is that it emphasizes grassroots design and independent development. For these reasons you get a higher percentage of new (because of the demographic growth) designers (because of the nature of the activity) in these circles than in the rpg scene on the average. New designers will naturally lean towards extreme and superficial solutions, and a new movement will naturally attract people most interested in its features - in this case, formalist game elements. As people have often remarked, the indie scene has this peculiar feature where people design just for the sake of design in a multitude of design competitions and events, and many rather average games are made. This is fertile ground for relatively superficial game design that often ends up in the formalist end of things.<br/><br/>Looking over the entire rpg scene, I wouldn't say that beginning designers in general are any more prone to excess formalism than anybody else. It's just that the guys who want to make unsystemic, naturalistic games don't hang out at Story Games.<br/><br/>In any case, abandoning your game just because somebody else labels it in a way you don't like doesn't make any sense. The important thing is whether the game works for you, not whether Ron Edwards will like it. As I outlined upthread, I think that the problem with formalism is that reducing the touchpoints between the fiction and play procedure runs the risk of dissociating the players from the fiction; if this does not happen, then the game is functional, no matter how formalistic it is. Of course it might only function for a very narrow audience, but that's postmodernism for you: as long as you know your audience and accept it, it's not a weakness of the product if there is somebody out there who doesn't appreciate the work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332229/#Comment_332229" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T07:56:40+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  7:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>It's just that the guys who want to make unsystemic, naturalistic games don't hang out at Story Games.</blockquote>\nWhere do they hang out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332232/#Comment_332232" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T08:26:23+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  8:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, RPGnet? The scene here in Finland is a bit different - smaller for one - so it's difficult for me to correlate real people with the Internet. Here in Finland the tendency is that the guys most committed to creating trad style games don't have very strong social networks to begin with for some reason; I'm somewhat distressed by this myself, as I'd like to be able to help people interested in game design more, but often my own design style makes me pretty useless as a critic for people who don't care for Forge-style design theory. I'd love it if I could point such designers towards some robust community where they could expect critical feedback that actually addresses perspectives that would be useful for them. Without these social networks too many designers end up working in their own small chambers without an entirely realistic understanding of the field they're offering their works to.<br/><br/>Of course, I reference traditional design preferences above, which is not exactly the same as disliking formalism. That just happens to be the dominant cultural connection: people who like formalistic approaches don't really have many choices except this particular community, so they tend to congregate here even if we're not, technically speaking, particularly pro-formalistic or anything. It's not like a formalistic approach by itself will improve your game in any way, after all. Then there's the fact that Story Games, specifically, seems to attract its share of freeform gamers who like stories, so there are certainly many different voices here to be heard, potentially.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
