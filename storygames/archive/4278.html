The GM was my girlfriend Kathy, and the other player was an ex (Laura) who was close friends with my gf. It was a follow-on to a previous fairly successful CoC freeform that Kathy had run for a group that included me but did not include Laura. Laura and I had gamed together before, usually with me GM-ing in more traditional systems (AD&amp;D, Vampire), but I don't recall that Kathy &amp; Laura had gamed together much previously.<br/><br/>The game described here was actually only half the "Boston Game" - there was a parallel story running at the same time with different, much "lighter" characters (also played by the same players) which used slightly different rules and guidelines. The stories were meant to complement each other and I think they did so very nicely.<br/><br/>This game happened in 1995, IIRC, so my memories may be a bit hazy.<br/><br/><b>What are your explicit rules and guidelines?</b><br/><br/>We used the character generation rules to provide some structure for character building - what kinds of characters would make sense, how competent they would be at various things. We took that prompt and built characters narratively - our character sheets were basically a couple of pages of text with some bolding and a few numbers.<br/><br/>We used Sanity. However, losses and their effects were assigned basically by fiat. At 0 Sanity, you had to describe the death, permanent incapacitation, or transformation of your character.<br/><br/>We constrained character design in two ways. First, characters must have some connection to an earlier scenario we had played. We ended up with two survivors of the previous scenario, although only one had been a PC (and that one had been played by someone else who was not in the Boston Game). Second, characters must have a secret or trauma related to that past scenario.<br/><br/>We preplayed in the following ways: We collaborated on choosing the nature of the menace we would deal with - we ended up deciding that another survivor had become the leader of a new cult and was seeking out his fellow survivors in order to convert or destroy them. We agreed that this was a "no win" scenario - in properly Lovecraftian fashion, the game would end with our characters dead, mad, broken, or transformed.<br/><br/><b>How is responsibility for tasks split up in your group (gm/player split, collaborative setting creation etc)?</b><br/><br/>GM'd, with GM having almost total scene framing and resolution power (players could suggest/kibitz, but GM makes decisions). Setting was chosen collaboratively, but GM has setting secrets and "reality" is constrained by facts established in earlier scenarios. Players play their character and suggest color, request scenes in general terms: "Can we have a scene where they visit Father Thomas in the mental hospital?"<br/><br/>In some scenes, players would portray an NPC instead of their PC, based on prompts from the GM.<br/><br/><b>How does the narrative flow? How do you go from scene to scene?</b><br/><br/>Strong scene framing by GM. Often some debrief between scenes to talk about what happened and what it might suggest to happen next.<br/><br/><b>How is continuity maintained? What records are kept?<br/></b><br/>We all kept profuse written notes. GM had a "bible" she referenced regularly.<br/><br/><b>What symbols, props or cues do you use? How do they function?</b><br/><br/>Bolded words on the character sheet were essentially currency. You could cross one off and lose Sanity (amount decided by GM) in order to say how a scene resolved, as long as that resolution spotlighted that character element. My GM informs me now that they weren't just any words - they were "derangements", psychological weaknesses or damage that the PC had which would break through under stress.<br/><br/>We had a bunch of period photos, drawings, and maps of Boston and surrounds for color and prompts.<br/><br/><b>How are in-story conflicts resolved? Are they? What provokes them?</b><br/><br/>It was definitely the standard "this happens, what do you do about it?" Fiat-heavy style. Negotiated.<br/><br/><b>How are differing player ideas about the story resolved? Are they? How are they avoided?</b><br/><br/>We were very much on the same page about the story from the start, and the regular interstitial debriefs kept us that way. Nonetheless, my fellow player managed to complete shock me with her denouement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96320/#Comment_96320" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T10:20:09+00:00" title="September 15, 2007 10:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 10:22AM by Matthijs.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Itras By</b><br/><br/><b>What are your explicit rules and guidelines?</b><br/><br/>They change from session to session, depending on my whims, feedback from the players, and the needs of the story. Among the rules we use the most are chance cards + impro-inspired resolution cards. For the first two or three sessions, we used the dice-based resolution system included in the rules; however, as part of our experimentation, we ditched those rules and tried something else.<br/><br/><b>How is responsibility for tasks split up in your group (gm/player split, collaborative setting creation etc)?</b><br/><br/>Practical stuff:<br/>- The GM helps the group find a date &amp; time for play.<br/>- The GM cooks food on game night.<br/>- The GM's wife puts the kids to bed, which sometimes interrupts play. (She's one of the players).<br/><br/>Creative stuff:<br/>- The setting is straight from the rules, which were written by one of the players. Setting elements have been added by the GM. <br/>- The GM creates bangs and quirky rules.<br/>- Players create characters.<br/><br/>Play procedures:<br/>- The GM starts the session.<br/>- Players drive play through dramatic stuff their characters do.<br/>- In some sessions, players frame scenes for each other.<br/>- In some sessions, players control parts of each others' characters.<br/>- In some sessions/scenes, players control NPCs.<br/>- In narrating resolution (based on cards), whoever narrates controls just about everything.<br/><br/><b>How does the narrative flow? How do you go from scene to scene?</b><br/><br/>The GM frames scenes, or asks players what they want to do. However, the use of chance cards can completely disrupt things - suddenly we have to play through a flashback, or re-play the same scene, or play it as if it were a musical.<br/><br/><b>How is continuity maintained? What records are kept?</b><br/><br/>The GM takes notes during the session, writes play reports on <a href="http://www.draug.no/itraswiki/pmwiki.php" rel="nofollow">wiki</a>. Players and GM attempt to reincorporate stuff along the way, though there is much forgetting of threads + NPCs. <br/><br/><b>What symbols, props or cues do you use? How do they function?</b><br/><br/>At the beginning of each session, players close their eyes and count down from 10 while the GM says a few words or sentences to get everyone into the right mood.<br/><br/><b>How are in-story conflicts resolved? Are they? What provokes them?</b><br/><br/>The player involved picks another player (or the GM) to draw a resolution card. That player uses the card as a guide for narrating the result.<br/>Usually, this happens at times where it would be fun if something went wrong, or something unexpected happened. Dramatic situations, usually.<br/><br/><b>How are differing player ideas about the story resolved? Are they? How are they avoided?</b><br/><br/>I'm not sure about this one. Our group has played together for a long time, and we've got a fairly solid understanding of what we want from the game, I think. Everything that's narrated gets accepted, as I understand the game. We've all read the setting, and we're all there with the understanding that the story could go in any direction - none of us have any idea how it's all going to end.<br/><br/><b>What am I missing?</b><br/><br/>This question: <i>What techniques do you use other than those dealing with conflicts? When do you use them? Why?</i><br/><br/>- We use chance cards when someone wants something weird to happen - usually a) if they're bored/the scene is going nowhere, or b) they want a challenge for themselves or the group. These cards are often surrealistic, in tone with the setting.<br/>- We use other techniques developed specifically to let all players have something to do even if their characters aren't present. Playing another character's subconscious desires/fears/hopes, for example, or controlling specific parts of the environment - such as weapons, or specific NPCs, or parts of someone's past or future.<br/><br/>And something like this question: <i>How does the group form their mode of interaction?</i> How is trust established? How do we know what we want to do - as individuals, and as a group? Who gets to decide what, and how? What expectations do we have from play, and how are they formed and expressed? These are the most basic and important things, I believe, and the hardest to talk sensibly about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96322/#Comment_96322" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T10:25:49+00:00" title="September 15, 2007 10:25AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the game that comes to mind for me when somebody says "freeform RP."  Online graphical-avatar chat RP in a community called <a href="http://www.furcadia.com/" rel="nofollow">Furcadia</a>.  This was probably ten years ago, so I don't know whether it's different now, or how accurate my memories are.<br/><br/><b>What are your explicit rules and guidelines?</b><br/><br/>Very few.  The main one was "the consent rule," which meant that if you didn't agree to have something happen to your character, it didn't happen.  There were other rules such as "this is for RP of anthropomorphic animals, not humans," and flags for degrees of RP structure (ranging from "I'm just chatting online using a furry avatar" to "I adhere to a specific fantasy setting and have a character sheet"), but these were not universally used.<br/><br/><b>How is responsibility for tasks split up in your group (gm/player split, collaborative setting creation etc)?</b><br/><br/>There were no GMs, though sometimes somebody would make up a villain character or characters and hook other players into a storyline involving conflict with those characters.  Setting was a mishmosh of background from the game's official Web site and whatever people dreamed up for their often highly elaborate character backstories.  Many of these setting elements were contradictory; each scene's coherence relied on a suspension-of-disbelief style phenomenon where players ignored, rationalized, and synthesized things that didn't fit each other.<br/><br/><b>How does the narrative flow? How do you go from scene to scene?</b><br/><br/>Narrative flowed according to people's schedules of signing on and off, meaning that keeping up to speed meant a great deal of in-character gossip about what'd happened since last visit.  Changing scenes was facilitated by the interface, where you'd walk your avatar from one place to another, perhaps upload a new environment, and start right off with dialogue about "phew, here we are, that was quite a walk" or the like.<br/><br/><b>How is continuity maintained? What records are kept?</b><br/><br/>See gossip, above.  Many players had individual chat logs of in-game activity they'd taken part in, which might get passed around between players for notable episodes, but there was no central record.<br/><br/><b>What symbols, props or cues do you use? How do they function?</b><br/><br/>The whole game interface consisted of props and cues.  Each character had distinctive colors and a click-to-read description that the player could edit at will as the character changed.  Objects in the game environment could be picked up and dropped, or scripted to allow doors to open, players to be relocated on the map, or other behaviors.  A small minority of players statted up their characters in one formal RP system or another (sometimes the official system from the Website, sometimes not) and used those as a point of reference for what their characters could or couldn't do, but seldom were dice rolled except as a joke.<br/><br/><b>How are in-story conflicts resolved? Are they? What provokes them?</b><br/><br/>Everything was posed narration according to the Consent Rule above; there was no formal line drawn between ordinary conversation and conflict with something at stake, or ordinary action and fighting.  If someone attacked your character, they'd describe the action--"Tani-ro feints left, then follows up with a quick slash at your midsection"--perhaps with intended outcome tacked on--"trying to land a blow by drawing you off-balance!"  Then you'd describe whether the attempt succeeded or failed and how, and your character's reaction to that.  Overstepping that flow, with something like "Alucard casts a spell, and your legs turn into molten lava" was likely to get vetoed under the Consent Rule and the perpetrator mocked as a "twink".  Not that this stopped anyone from god-moding; instead you'd get "Alucard casts a spell that surrounds you in a dome of lava, which crashes in upon you" and out-of-character whining if you made up a way to evade it--"No way!  Nobody could get out of that!"  As you can maybe tell, this led to a fair bit of hurt feelings out of character.  People had various ways of dealing with the issue, such as signing off and pretending nothing ever happened, or letting their character "die" but finding some plot contrivance to revive them.<br/><br/>As for what provoked such things... it ran the gamut.  Personal disagreements and personality clashes.  "Evil" characters attacking people just because.  Power struggles in "families" and "guilds."  Sparring matches that escalated to violence.  Attempted rape and enslavement were particularly common conflict-starters.<br/><br/><b>How are differing player ideas about the story resolved? Are they? How are they avoided?</b><br/><br/>Not at all, or with OOC discussion/argument/bickering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96398/#Comment_96398" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T17:38:34+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  5:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paula and I have run 5 LARPs together now. I think the process whereby we write these games is instructive in how we intend them to be played. <br/><br/>The games we have run have all been comedies:<br/>- In Gamers' Wives, the premise is that gaming is as popular as professional soccer and the game focusses on the private lives of the gamers, their partners and the media. GW1 was set at the World Cup, GW2 at a charity auction. <br/>- Billy Bunter's Xmas Hamper was set in an English Boy's school in the 20's. The eponymous hero is a disgustingly greedy oik.<br/>- Conclave of the Vanities was about Wizards' apprentices in the Dying Earth.<br/><br/>We have some idea about the setting and then we write the characters. Actually, Paula writes them because she's just so good at it. She can turn out 10 characters in an evening and they'll all be disgustingly well written and different.<br/><br/>There is a general background sheet (1 side A4 for the game) and each character is no more than 2 sides of A4 (and usually only 1). A character sheet has character background, secrets and powers, and goals.<br/><br/>My involvement tends to be more on the plotting and resolution side of things. <br/><br/>Each character will have three goals representing their involvement in three on going unresolved issues. We call these plots - the players will attempt to resolve these during the game. We write all the characters' names on post-its, think up some plots, and stick the post-its on the wall to represent the web of issues. This is rather much the same as any relationship diagram you might do for a tabletop game. We have two or three big plots involving everyone, some medium size plots involving 4-8 characters and some small plots with only 2-3 characters. We work out how many plots are needed to give everyone three.<br/><br/>We then do secrets that support these plots and finally powers which are usually ways that characters can get one up on each other or discover another's secrets. Examples are "Biffing", in a fight you will win unless the other character also has Biffing. Pillow Talk, if you have sex with someone, they will let slip a secret afterwards. In Conclave, powers were actually spells written on small pieces of paper that players said out loud and then ripped up (the Dying Earth is what inspired the D&amp;D spell system).<br/><br/>I've tried various different resolution systems but all are designed to try to minimise GM involvement. There are only two of us to run these games and with 10-20 players we don't have the time to resolve everything. Players generally resolve things by talking to each other. When they need some extra help, the resort to powers. Players have 6 uses in total of their 3 powers. Each power is activated by tearing off a number from a strip they are given.<br/><br/>I've also tried a system similar to Best Friends were you can push your ability to overcome resistance and be pushed back by a superior foe.<br/><br/>Players can get up to 4 more uses of their powers if they fulfill certain conditions. In Gamers' Wives we had a hot list. This represented tabloid interest in the characters and the top 3 on it got extra uses. Graham staged a fight with his wife in GW1 just to get them back on the hotlist, and not even for the extra powers, just so he could feel important. The hot list is an excellent tool for driving player behaviour towards the outrageous which is what Gamers' Wives demands. In Conclave, players could get more spells from finding scrolls hidden around the place.<br/><br/>We give costume ideas for characters and provide some props. For example, for Gamers' Wives 2, I made a cardboard cut-out shitzu for one of the characters as her lap dog. In Conclave, the players had to cooperate to build a magic item to retrieve the election rules from another dimension. We used a plastic children's fishing rod that came in three parts for this. We also insisted that every mage wear a hat. Invisible characters just took of their hat.<br/><br/>The GM's role is to resolve any issues players might have, explain rules, help make conflicts go smoothly if there any problems and to stage events during the LARP. In Gamers' Wives 1 we had a tabletop game take place within the LARP, I was the GM for this. In GW2, we had an auction and a song performed by the regrouped Space Girls. Conclave had an election - actually so did Billy Bunter and GW2. We make a crib sheet for each GM that gives timings of events, some key information about the game and some blurb to read at the beginning to introduce the game.<br/><br/>As GMs we also keep an eye on how things are progressing, making sure everyone is involved. If things have slowed down a bit will chivvy them along by releasing some information or creating an event, perhaps putting someone on the hotlist.<br/><br/>The other game we ran was very different. We had signed up to play a Harry Potter game at a Con but the GM didn't show. Paula had the beginnings on an HP LARP on a single sheet of cocoa stained paper under our bed. I mentioned this and she was persuaded to run it from what she could remember. Paula and I GMed. She was McGonagall and I Snape. The game was played without any set rules and without any clear plot, except that the snitch had gone missing or something. We had a quick discussion at the start about where the game was going and caught up a few times as it progressed. I didn't really know what Paula was up to, nor she me.<br/><br/>I took half the players and declared a Potions class. I told them to get on with it and then left the room. When I came back 10 minutes later Hufflepuff had accidentally summoned Cthulhu (using a stuffie prop). It was that kind of game. Very improv, everyone pitching in. I can't remember half of what went on. Quidditch was resolved, on player suggestion, by everyone flying around a bit and then Harry Potter winning. There was something about snakes in the tuck shop. It was mad and delightful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96533/#Comment_96533" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T09:21:31+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  9:21AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll pick a small larp called Together, in which I played. I guess it falls under the huge, undefined-umbrella of freeform. I'll cover tabletop later.<br/><br/><b>What are your explicit rules and guidelines?</b><br/><br/>Explicit rules were pretty much limited to: if someone starts a sentence with word True, what follows it is true and character(s) act that way.<br/><br/><b>How is responsibility for tasks split up in your group (gm/player split, collaborative setting creation etc)?</b><br/><br/>The larpwright (GM) defines the setting and intial character sketches, including things that can be considered secrets. The players collaborate (guided by the GM) and create a shared histories for their characters. In this particular case, characters were childhood friends having their yearly dinner meeting; the GM sketched out my character (who he was, what he was doing nowadays, what things that others did not know had happened to him, roughly feelings towards other characters). We then collaborated on creating the shared history; what we had done as kids, what kind of families we had, where had we gone after we split out from childhood, etc.<br/><br/>During the game the larpwright stayed out of the game (we played in apartment and he stayed in one room) unless someone went and requested his help, usually needing more information concerning his character history. Near the end of the game when we had a situtation that could not be acted out between characters, we asked the GM over to explain what happens (basically, he told us how it feels when we let an alien parasite willingly inside us).<br/><br/><b>How does the narrative flow? How do you go from scene to scene?</b><br/><br/>The narrative flows in "organic" way - we start a game in our characters and it continues like whatever social happening would continue, through dialogue and physical actions. There are no separate scenes - the first scene started in central railway station where I met up with some characters (we players phoned each other few hours prior to the start in-character and set up the meeting place), and travelled to the playing location.<br/><br/><b>How is continuity maintained? What records are kept?</b><br/><br/>The game was one-shot, so no longer upkeeping for the continuity was needed. The records included character history sketch and group history sketch; everything build on top of that was done via speaking and just kept in mind.<b><br/><br/>What symbols, props or cues do you use? How do they function?</b><br/><br/>None; what exists in real world exists in imagined world. I think we had one weapon prop that was never used; I guess someone would have said BANG out aloud and acted shooting it out.<br/><br/><b>How are in-story conflicts resolved? Are they? What provokes them?</b><br/><br/>Conflict are resolved through dialogue and physical acting. There are no abstract "conflicts" as such. If a situation (as in, what ever situtations tend to rise up during a social happening) happens, it's dealt with in what ever way the characters deal with it using the mentioned means.<br/><br/><b>How are differing player ideas about the story resolved? Are they? How are they avoided?</b><br/><br/>There is no story as such and thus they are not resolved. I don't think there are different player ideas about the story or the game in general; the main point of pre-loading things and collaboratively creating stuff is to unify the players vision of what kind of game they are playing. Since the players are, in a sense, non-existent during the game (there is no meta-level in the play, you do everything through your character), the avoidance is quite total.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96751/#Comment_96751" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T23:46:31+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 11:46PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Second datapoint, tabletop one-shot scenario for convention use, <i>The Ferry Game</i>.<br/><br/><b>What are your explicit rules and guidelines?</b><br/><br/>What stands in the (sketchy) character background is the truth but aside from that, players are free to improvise and add stuff as they go. If resolution mechanics are needed, player rolls 1d10 and the result is interpreted in scale of 1=bad... 10=very good. If the roll affects just characters, players can interpret as they wish, if it affects something else, GM interprets. Rolls should only be made if something physical needs to be resolved. It's a guided GM fiat and this is told in the introduction; if something absolutely needs to be decided and judged, GM does that.<br/><br/><b>How is responsibility for tasks split up in your group (gm/player split, collaborative setting creation etc)?</b><br/><br/>GM has prepared the character backgrounds and the scenario, briefs the players and kicks the scenario on. Apart from a scripted sequence in the middle, the GM's task is to support the players and fill in the rest of the world, not to lead the game - unless (as this is a time-limited convention scenario) the game does not move on on good enough pace. Then GM can move things forward. Players play their characters. Players can also play non-player characters, if needed, or a second GM can help with them (tried this once, worked out really well).<br/><br/><b>How does the narrative flow? How do you go from scene to scene?</b><br/><br/>There are roughly two scenes, separated by a short, heavily scripted sequence. The players start their journey in a Ferry (kind of floating hotel-boozing-land) and are free to explore the cliches of Ferry-trip as they see fit, usually in a kind of mild parody-tone. The scripted sequence deals with the Ferry sinking with all hands, including the player characters. The second scene is something akin to a groundhog day-movie, and it's the same scene as the first one, starting a bit later than it, but this time players are likely to know that the Ferry will sink. What they do is up to them, the GM resorts back to the support-role. The scenes are not divided into the subscenes, unless a player or the GM wants to frame one ("Okay, you are now in your cabin with this hot chick").<br/><br/><b>How is continuity maintained? What records are kept?</b><br/><br/>It's one-shot game, so no continuity as such. The players have their character backgrounds. The GM should keep some records of what and when things happen in the first scene, in order to bring in the repetative feeling to the second scene.<br/><br/><b>What symbols, props or cues do you use? How do they function?</b><br/><br/>Usually cabin keys, tax free -price lists, Welcome Aboard -leaflets, map of the Ferry - pretty much whatever I have kept from my own Ferry trips. Their main function is to add color; it's much more fun to plan a shopping spree to the tax free -shops (an intergral part of the Ferry trip, that one) when you have a catalog handy.<br/><br/><b>How are in-story conflicts resolved? Are they? What provokes them?</b><br/><br/>If there are physical conflicts and it feels like they could use some suspense, the dice can be used. Or not. Usually everything is handled through in-character dialogue and negotiation.<br/><br/><b>How are differing player ideas about the story resolved? Are they? How are they avoided?</b><br/><br/>There usually are no different player ideas about the story. Again, a strong emphasis on the introduction; players should know what they are playing and why they are playing after that. Immersion and the constraints in setting (closed area, free play in the first scene and free play with heavy, usually player-introduced pace, in the second one) tend to guide the players to focus solely on their characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
