Even in games in which character creation is extremely simple (such as wushu), it is not uncommon to see the entire first session taken up with building character backgrounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is this: How much time do you think is necessary between the organization and logistical discussion of a game, and the time when you begin actual play? How long is too long? Do you believe it is necessary to begin play during the first session of a game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188887/#Comment_188887" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T12:22:14+00:00" title="January 18, 2009 12:22PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can also mitigate some of that time by doing it, directed, online: In a google group, yahoogroup, or simply exchanging emails.

Any discussion of the group "fitting together" was left to the players to work out among themselves outside the actual sessions.<br/><br/>This worked all right with games with well-defined roles (e.g., D&amp;D, where the players can simply tell each other, "I want to play the mage", etc.) or with groups who already know each other well.  In other situations, I've seen it fall down badly.<br/><br/>Personally, I prefer quick character generation and/or develop-in-play generation, so it can be done during the first session while still allowing time to play.  <br/><br/>I also tend to use a lot fewer house rules than I used to, and to both come to the game with a sketchier world background, and encourage the players to contribute to the world.  Sometimes this makes things faster; sometimes it doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188889/#Comment_188889" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T12:53:35+00:00" title="January 18, 2009 12:53PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me add (citing SotC another time) that the game works perfectly even with the "on the fly" character creation: you only need to define a name, two aspects and the top 3 skills (and maybe choose a stunt package), and you play.

On first blush, I am tempted to say either that a game pitch that can't last through a setup session is a weak pitch/concept to start with, but I can't say that without thinking back to some train wrecked chargen sessions that tore the focus asunder.<br/><br/>I also do not like to delay group play with chargen sessions or setup sessions.  That is why I almost always get right into the play as quickly as possible after chargen.  I will always run something that first session, either by having players prep ahead of time, playing  game with quick chargen or templates, or just running a short James Bond-esque prologue cliffhanger that is short, but gets things rolling and has a cliffhanger to keep them thinking about the next game.<br/><br/>Games that have long chargen should give a thought to insuring that chargen independent of a session is possible, or that templates and such can be made to speed up flow.  Another idea is to create some basic templates in games by making a good build of a stealth-guy, a spell-guy, a warrior, a noble, etc. in your system and letting the players dress those up in color that makes them happy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188912/#Comment_188912" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T15:45:36+00:00" title="January 18, 2009  3:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's very, very easy to put all the exciting stuff about the game into the setup session -- the whole "play before you play" thing. If you doodle up a cool character but his coolness is derived from his backstory and character-making process, it's safe and confined and can't me sullied by actual play. It's very hard for an RPG session/campaign to live up to the great mini-novelizations we come up with on our own.<br/><br/>That said, my very favorite setup approach is to specifically disallow lengthy backstories. If someone has a great backstory idea, make the game about <i>that</i> (shared setting creation in BW). Or play specifically at the moment when the character(s) first get into trouble (DitV). Or play one of the games where your backstory is totally irrelevant to the future progress of the game (Lacuna, 3:16).<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188920/#Comment_188920" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T16:46:00+00:00" title="January 18, 2009  4:46PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think some games have you itching to play your character so badly, that it doesn't matter how long passes between generation and role-play.

Especially not for a game that we're going to keep coming back to.  I really don't like coming straight out of character creation and into playing, because that first session will always be a scattershot, half-assed parade of things that I will look back at later on and say "I wish I had done that differently."  Give me a little time to soak it in, to prepare, and I have a much more enjoyable time.

Some games need more, some need less.  <i>3:16</i> barely needs it at all.<br/><br/>One of my games, <i>The Rustbelt</i>, requires a character &amp; situation creation meetup before the first session of actual play.  But that part is actually pretty quick -- creating characters is easy, and once you've got them it's easy to create the starting situation.  The reason it's set apart is because the GM needs time to think about it and get things behind the scenes ready.  He's got a lot of NPCs that he has to represent as actual <i>characters</i>, and he's got to start thinking about the PCs, and how he can squeeze them into revealing all of their most monstrous and admirable qualities.  It takes some thought and reflection (but not planning), and therefore time.<br/><br/>Or maybe I just suck at it, and <i>I</i> need time to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
