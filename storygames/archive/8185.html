Neither Jesse or Laura had played or read the rules before this weekend, but both were familiar with the concept and how good scifi works.  I explain the rules as we go and I throw out my one request concerning the shock.  I don't like the shock to be any sort of immortality or extreme longevity.  Those are not bad shocks, but they come up a lot and I've done them enough for my taste.<br/><br/>The shock we settled on was robots, and we make the Laura the owner.  We each come up with a minutiae to flesh out the shock some and chose robots have free will, it's easy to tell robots from people, and robots are humanoid.  Next we moved on to issues.  Jesse picks relationships, Laura chooses equal rights, and I decide on the decay of society.  We then decided on some minutiae concerning our issues to bring them to life.  Some notable examples were robots have human emotions, robot brothels, and class society.  The we had upper and lower cities with the wealthy living high above the pollution and the poor and those displaced by robots live in squalor on the ground level.<br/><br/>We moved onto protagonist creation.  All of us chose to make protagonists in the issue we chose.  Jesse was a Hugh Hefner type, except with robot playmates.  I can't remember his story goal exactly, but it involved being accepted.  Laura was a robot fighting to have robots accepted as people in here local city.  I played a U.S. senator who was trying to get a constitutional amendment through congress and to the states for ratification that would only allow robots to be use for dangerous jobs and jobs humans could not do.  <br/><br/>Jesse's antagonist was a former "employee" of his, now, all robot operated brothel.  Laura's was actually my protagonist, who mostly interacted with her character through an aid.  My antagonist was a wealthy robot industrialist.<br/><br/>Our story had people operating on very high level, a local one and a deeply personal level all tied together through links and antagonists.  In the end robots were recognized as people in Laura's city, the amendment limiting the role of robots was passed along with one creating a third robotic house of congress, and Jesse's character's wife left him and he hired back his former employee.<br/><br/>While the story had a fairly grim setting, the tale didn't seem too dark.  I think our choice of praxis had a lot to do with this.  We had manipulation/honesty and anger/love.<br/><br/>I think the game went well.  Jesse and Laura both enjoyed it, but Jesse commented that we created a lot for what was a fairly short story, so we decided to play another session next week.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180041/#Comment_180041" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T11:26:38+00:00" title="November 24, 2008 11:26AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There were two things that I found really interesting.  First of all, when I chose "relationships" relative to robots I originally had in mind a character who had completely isolated himself from people.  Why deal with people and all their complications when I can custom build my entire social circle?  But I went the total opposite direction.  I want with a very human oriented person who saw robots as an extension of the human experience rather than a replacement.  I liked that.  I think it was your minutia contribution of "Robot Brothels" that sort of pushed me over the edge.  Oh, and my Story Goal was, "to not be seen as an exploiter."<br/><br/>The second thing is that I now thing Shock is extraordinarily sneaky.  Probably the most significant thing I didn't know about the game was that it pretty much forces you to tell short stories.  At first I thought the large amount of material generated at the start of play was a problem relative to shortness of the game.  Then I thought about it some more.  Then I realized it's doing it's job.  It makes me want to play again.<br/><br/>I read the rules and paid particular attention to how you continue the game.  It says you make up new issues for sure and you can add another Shock if the generated fiction warrants one being created.  I realized that Shock does a very, very sneaky thing that I think will only become apparent over multiple sessions of play.<br/><br/>Growing up I never much cared for science-fiction and the reason for that was it always seemed so... sterile.  We have these characters but these characters aren't really all that interesting because they're eclipsed by these big ideas.  The characters are there mostly to illustrate of explore these big ideas.  That why I stuck with mostly horror stories growing up and why I was so excited when I discovered the Swords &amp; Sorcery stuff Ron presents in Sorcerer &amp; Sword.  It's so much more personal and inward focused.<br/><br/>Shock forces you into this short story mode in the face of a lot of big ideas specifically to keep the game focused on the ideas and not too much on the turmoil of the protagonists.  The stories are about the protagonists but the protagonists are always subordinate to the ideas.  They're short burning candles existing long enough to shed illumination on some points before blowing out and we have to get new candles.  I like it for all the reasons I hated it as a kid and I want to play with it a little more.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180047/#Comment_180047" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T11:42:16+00:00" title="November 24, 2008 11:42AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WillH</cite>The shock we settled on was robots, and we make the Laura the owner.

When you convert a short story into a movie, you get a dense, quality movie. When you convert a novel, you get a series or you miss a whole lot. I think it's one of the reason so much Philip K.

When you have people playing who are committed to making good science-fiction they will naturally extract issues from the shock presented.  In fact, that feels more natural to me.  The other method feels more like a training exercise for people who are used to using Shocks as cool color on an otherwise bog standard action flick.<br/><br/>To answer Joshua's question about robo-bunnies and free will.  My thinking on the issue was similar to ideas behind psychoactive drugs.  A person suffering from major depression, still has free will but they're disinclined to make certain decisions because of how their brain chemicals make them feel.  The robo-bunnies work the same way.  They're factory made to feel "frisky" but they still have free will within that emotional state of being.<br/><br/>In fact, that was that the point of change for my character.  In the end I sent the robot bunnies back to have their emotions "normalized" because, "It's no different than when we used to give the girls drugs in the old days."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180068/#Comment_180068" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T13:04:54+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  1:04PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The _best_ part of Shock for our group was letting everyone pick their own issues independently and then brainstorming a shock that worked with that strange and unexpected combination. Really. Super fun.<br/><br/>I'd argue the issues are the important part, hence choosing them first (as the book says) decides what the game is about. The shock is just a thing that highlights the issues -- that's the sci fi rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180071/#Comment_180071" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T13:14:53+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  1:14PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben,<br/><br/>Ah, I see where you're coming from.  You're talking about picking issues and then *working* to find a Shock that hits all those issues.  I can see how that can work, yes.  I've heard stories though about people not really understanding that if you do it that way you have to wrestle with the Shock a bit.  So you end up with things like, someone picks, "women's rights" as an issue an then the group chooses, "perfect global defense" as the Shock because the group thinks that's cool.  And then someone is sitting there struggling with, "women's rights and perfect global defense" as not really having much of anything to do with each other.<br/><br/>That still seems backwards to me as I'm a very "issue" oriented person.  I'm horrible to play high color board games with because I start wanting to redesign it as an RPG that tackles the issues presented in the flavor of the board game.  So, it's much more natural for me to go, "Robots!" and ask myself "What issues arise from Robots?"  I'd say it's a lot easier to say, "What Issues does this Shock raise?" rather than "What Shock would hit all these Issues?"<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180076/#Comment_180076" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T13:30:45+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  1:30PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2008 1:31PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, exactly. One game we had issues like unemployment, wealth, environmental collapse and stagnant gene pool, and we came up with cryogenics as the shock, but when we fleshed it out we decided that putting people on ice was actually very cheap and easy, so people who couldn't find work or who were genetically "undesirable" were being put on ice by the societal elite, so the "have's" could enjoy more of what the planet had left to offer.<br/><br/>That's not an angle I would have normally thought of, and our first discussions were something like "the rich want to get put on ice and sent to healthier planets" (the default "cryo is rare, precious and expensive") but when we had to include issues like unemployment it made us go for a more twisted answer.<br/><br/>That's happened at every Shock: game I've played, which is really why I love it. Serious group creativity during the creation phase and I'm always surprised by the results.<br/><br/>And I totally agree with William's original point about creating a whole interesting world and then wanting to play it more. I've even thought you could extract the shock setting creation method and use it for any other game.

I mean I didn't read <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> because it's a cometary on religion, relationships and family.  I read it because it was about a man raised by Martians who comes home to Earth.  The cometary on those issues are what makes it a good story.

"Decay of Society," or something close to it is listed as a sample shock.  I think the important thing with issues is they be something you are concerned about.  Personally, I fudge this a bit.  There are issues I find interesting to explore that I'm not personally worried about or have a stake in.

If the shock is environmental collapse, that means we aren't really concerned about environmental collapse, it's just the thing that impacted the issues we are concerned with (can I still be Altruistic once all the food is gone). And vice versa: if the environmental collapse is an issue it's the thing we are addressing via the shock, which could be something as simple as space travel (do we leave this dying earth behind).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180128/#Comment_180128" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T16:13:43+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  4:13PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I see how that can work.

In the second session we only added one new issue to the grid, privacy.  We had established an almost omnipresent media in the fiction so we ran with that.  Already having a significant amount of fiction from the start made for a richer game experience.  <br/><br/>For our third and finally session we added the shock Robot Civil War and the issue Religion.  The robots and robot sympathizers were in open armed rebellion fighting for robot equality.  Things took a much darker turn this session and we had a tragic ending.  Jesse's played the president who used, some might say abused, his position to fund research to develop a way for humans and robots to reproduce.  Laura played a Manhattan Project style scientist working on a robot doomsday virus that would shut down all robots.  I played a cabinet minister fighting against the proposition of robot internment and advocating robot rights.  In the end, robot/human hybrids were created, the people were persuaded to accept robots as people with the same rights as everyone else, and the doomsday virus was released.  It was all very tragic.<br/><br/>One thing that was constant through all three sessions was our stories were a mix of high level movers and shakers and people dealing with deeply with every day life.  Well everyday life with a twist at least.  The result was well developed setting that felt real.<br/><br/>I do have a rules question.  How many credits are antagonists supposed to have?
