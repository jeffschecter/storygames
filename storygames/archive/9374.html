She's big, powerful, in touch with everything, the creator of the world and life, but largely hands off. Every few hundred years, she bestows a particularly virtuous woman- human, dwarf, elf, doesn't matter- with a miracle pregnancy, resulting in a virgin birth. These Daughters of the Goddess go forth, do the Goddess's work, right wrongs, and spread love and prosperity.<br/><br/>Right now there's seven of these, known as the Seven Sisters. Your average peasant or noble or holy priest worships all of them and above all the Goddess, but most priests and priestess pick a patron Sister. (Which affects their powers and works like normal divinity picks.)<br/><br/>Here's what I've got so far. I've got a couple slots to fill.<br/><br/>Anima, the Matriarch<br/>One of the oldest of the Sisters, Anima was a dwarf, and brought the word of the Goddess to the dwarves in ancient times. A clan matriarch, she was wise, kind, and saw the first cities rise to prosperity.<br/><br/>Anana, the Spirit Guardian<br/>(Based on Ishtar/Inana) As old as Anima (or perhaps older), Anana was the Goddess's gift to the elves, a wise mystic who traveled into the land of death to rescue her people. Anana is thought to watch over the dead.<br/><br/>Althea, the Muse<br/>A great poet, musician, practicing magician, and patroness of the arts, Althea is exalted by those who cherish creativity.<br/><br/>Alma, the Healer<br/>A wandering healer and miracle worker, Alma devoted her life to curing the sick and dying, fighting plagues and famines.<br/><br/>Alexandra, the Crusader<br/>A warrior woman, Alexandra led crusades to the dark corners of the world, squashing threats to the nations of humanity- goblins, orcs, and far darker things. She died in battle with an ancient dragon, but not before she took the fell beast with her.<br/><br/>I need two more. And for whatever reason, their names all start and end with A.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207833/#Comment_207833" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T18:40:44+00:00" title="May 17, 2009  6:40PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I posted this elsewhere, and it pretty much devolved into a discussion about my assumptions concerning matriarchy/feminism.

That's why in China and Japan there's a bunch of "God(Goddess) of Fortune", "God of Happiness" etc. Frex, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Gods_of_Fortune" rel="nofollow">Seven Lucky Gods</a> made no sense to me for the longest time because I kept going, "Wait, I thought X was the God of Happiness. Who is Y then? Happiness? Huh, how are they different then?" etc. <br/><br/>So a suggestion might be that, in play, you forget the "the Muse/Crusader/Etc" bit, and just focus on the name and role. Sure, everyone knows that Alma is The Healer, but if someone was crass enough to say "Alma the Healer", an elderly man or woman in the village would give them an earful for trying to tie one of the Heavenly Sisters to a single base element. "What, do you need to take off your gloves to count to 10, too?"  Just a thought.<br/><br/>Aaaanyway.<br/><br/><b>Aranimasa</b> (or '<b>Arania Amassa</b>', if the name-rule holds) is one of the elder sisters. Sometimes called "the Lamplighter", she is the one credited for using fire to light away the darkness, and of gathering people around the village-hearth for sharing stories and culture. She is also credited for creating the early system of writing, and using it for the keeping of records and political proclamations. Without Aranimasa, there still would have been towns and cities, but there would have been no culture, communion or fellowship. People who put their faith in her put their faith in other people, in culture.<br/>Arania Amassa also has another face, a lusty one of a worldly elder sister. She is one known for idle gossip at its minor end, and spite/political betrayal at its far end. That's the reason that record-keepers, journalists and political journeymen worship Aranimasa in one way, and a class of exalted concubines, eunuchs and courtiers revere her in a very different way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207912/#Comment_207912" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T08:37:54+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  8:37AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You may also want to check out <br/><br/><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" rel="nofollow">Crystal Dragon Jesus</a><br/><br/>for some ideas, I think your mother and 7 daughters has been done more or less specifically before (not a rip on you, 7's a common number people turn to for X'y type stuff) but you can also get other ideas how people avoided saying Cathloicism/Christian.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207915/#Comment_207915" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T09:15:40+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  9:15AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Andy, that's a really important point.

Maldorians are all dickhead chauvinists. Consequently what <b>I</b> noticed here was that the myth doesn't seem to make any sense on a basic level: how is a female Goddess imbuing a mortal woman with a pregnancy that results in a daughter to the Goddess? How are you a daughter to a Goddess that never carried you to term? This stuff makes sense in the Christian myth due to how, you know, basic biology corroborates with the myth. Male + female = pregnancy for the woman, the father is god and thus the child is a son of a god and so on.<br/><br/>If this issue isn't intellectually interesting for you, ignore as you will.

Maldorians are all dickhead chauvinists.

How are you a daughter to a Goddess that never carried you to term? This stuff makes sense in the Christian myth due to how, you know, basic biology corroborates with the myth.

Male power is about killing things.  Like you expect me to believe a <i>man </i>used his mystic power to create a pregnancy.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li
