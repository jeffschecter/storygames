I like both, but it is my theory that a game without a gamemaster, while superficially increasing the creativity at the table by potentially drawing from multiple pools, has a limited creative vista because the stories in such games tend to necessarily be predetermined by the rules in order to guide the player narrative.  A game with a gamemaster, while superficiallly decreasing the creativity at the table by drawing from only one pool, has an expanded creative vista because the stories he can tell are not necessarily limited in the same way.  An easier way to explain that is via Contender, which is about a specific kind of story, so all the scenes created by players go into that story.  A boxing game run with a gamemaster in a different system could be about a lot more than the kind of stories told in Contender.  Adding a human storyteller is what provides for that flexibility.<br/><br/>Anyway, to demonstrate my argument, I noted that GM-less games tend to be competitive, OR tend to basically be mutual games of one-on-one in which what happens to your character has no bearing on what happens to mine, OR must violate the Czege principle.  If we're a team, and I narrate a challenge for us players to overcome, and then take part in overcoming it, bam, yawn-zone for me.  This perspective is because I like games with cooperative team-play, which is what traditional games with a gamemaster tend to be.   <br/><br/>My friends said that not all GM-less games are competitive or joint one-on-one sessions, but when I asked for examples, we came up with none.  So:  got any?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242752/#Comment_242752" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T13:37:48+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  1:37PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2009 1:39PM by komradebob.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mythic GM-emulator?

People love the dog!) The game was about the story of the play and the story of the play being written. This meant that everyone won if the story was fun, which it turned out to be.<br/><br/>This worked because each turn players make up whole scenes - saying what all the characters do (rather than just their own) and are given a "To Happen" roll byt a referee (which can be any of the players). Players put out different versions of what happens in each scene and which happens is settled by a dice rolling contest. Scene builds on scene to tell a full story.<br/><br/>Like I said, these can be competitive but I use the same approach to do murder mysteries (we all win if we find out who done it) horror games (we all win if we save the world) and many other stories. <br/><br/>One could debat that they are GMless because the role of deciding to happen rolls is still present but there is no one who is the authority on what is true in the game. All the players share that power. <br/><br/>Personally I like a good competitive game but I don't think they make good stories. Stories really need more collaboration than that. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242760/#Comment_242760" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T13:57:36+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  1:57PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shock: Social Science Fiction and Polaris both work in this way:<br/>Every player has an "antagonist" player, and play goes around in spotlight scenes where interaction between protagonist/antagonist is central.<br/><br/>That doesn't strike me as particularly cooperative, though.<br/><br/>Ribbon Drive is a GMless Cooperative game about road trips and self-discovery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242761/#Comment_242761" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T13:58:56+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  1:58PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>I read <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12354.phtml" rel="nofollow">this review</a>.  It says that the mechanics in Polaris come into play when players disagree.  Is that correct?  Also, the blurb says that the characters are collectively defending their home.  Does that mean a challenge created by one player will be responded to, in part, by that player?  That would seem to avoid the mutual one-on-one game feeling of Contender but it also sounds like it means I create challenges for myself to beat. <br/><br/>- - - <br/><br/>Chris, that sounds like a cool game.  It does fit into what I would consider to be competitive rather than cooperative.  I like competitive games, and am a fan of Poison'd.  I also think there's a lot of fun to be had in games that are both - like the old board game where Roman senators compete, but not too much or Rome will fall, giving them a cooperative goal too - but I'm looking for something else here.  Thanks for the cool example though.   I'll add Engle Matrix Games to my "check this out" list.<br/><br/>- - - <br/><br/>joepub, I'll go read up on Ribbon Drive.

The players negotiate the basic rules of the setting at the start, and then create the world as play goes on.<br/><br/>Like Ben, I'm unsure what you mean by "cooperative" in this context. The basic rules of fiction say that any story needs some kind of conflict. In a GM'd game, the players are generally on one side of the conflict against the forces played by the GM, which usually means the players' characters are cooperating. If there's no GM, the conflict/competition necessarily has to be generated by the players themselves \u2014 so yes, to some degree there is competition, as one player creates a conflict that the players then take sides resolving. That's really no different than a GM'd game, though, if you consider a GM to be merely a player with greater story-power.<br/><br/>To get this, it isn't necessary to make the players take sides for the whole game. In Universalis, players aren't bound to the same character: during every scene players decide which characters to play. Some of those may be heroes, some antagonists. You might be playing one of each at the same time \u2014 after all, that's what an author does when writing a book. The ultimate goal is a good story, not necessarily success for one side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242785/#Comment_242785" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T15:12:08+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  3:12PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            . .  . er, <i>absolutely </i>no clue?     <br/><br/>Hm, I will try to clarify my terms a bit.

The regular players work together in play to overcome the challenges in front of them. The interest of the players in working together aligns with the interest of their characters in working together, so you can really commit to it. (Of course, the "cooperation" here seems pretty limited, since you cooperate by teaming up to beat up your other friend, who GM's.)<br/><br/>Most GM-less games have the problem of where to get the adversity from. In Polaris, you get it from the player across from you. Since that player introduces your adversity, you can't really have much player cooperation. If we <em>really</em> cooperate, then why would I make things harder on you? Even if our characters cooperate, the interests of my character to cooperate does not align with my interests as a player. You might say we cooperate to tell the story, but that seems like a relatively weak kind of "cooperation," ultimately, since we could work together or against each other, and either way still have a good story.<br/><br/>I love Polaris, but I wouldn't call it cooperative. Not as I understand the term, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242796/#Comment_242796" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T16:14:43+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  4:14PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cough... <i>Geiger Counter</i>? ...cough...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242806/#Comment_242806" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T17:30:11+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  5:30PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Furthermore, the structure of the game does not depend on player (or character) disagreement.

Totally interesting and a topic I love to geek out on, but your examples of Coming of Age don't convince me that the Czege Principle has been disproved.  Those examples are snapshots, so I may be leaping to conclusions based on insufficient data here . . . but I wonder if the Coming of Age scenarios you describe are fun for the player in the scene <i>but not for the other players</i>.  I ask that because they come across to me as being fun in much the same way telling other people about your character is fun, if you take my meaing.  For me, the Czege Principle encompasses the entire group, not just the player producing and resolving the conflict.  I suspect that is true about most gamers, which is why we have the cliche about telling people about our characters.<br/><br/>I certainly believe in conflict as a driving force in story, and am not arguing for conflictless games.  It is simply my hypothesis that GM-less games are driven by competition among the players and cannot be cooperative (our team against the conflict!) without violation of the Czege Principle.   Within a larger context, this says something about the scope of the creative vistas available within GM-less games (unless they are competitive), but for now I just want to know if I'm way off-base in asserting that hypothesis, and I want to play the awesome games that come being told that I am off-base.<br/><br/>I greatly appreciate the counter-examples given, and look forward to playing them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242852/#Comment_242852" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T08:19:01+00:00" title="November 20, 2009  8:19AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only way I can think of something like this working is if you have a set of problems that come at the PCs outside the influence of the players.

Getting tripped up in the meta-cooperative nature of the game is where the definitions would be confusing.  Heck, a cooperative game can have a meta-competitive atmosphere if the players start arguing with each other.  That isn't the level I'm examining, though.  <br/><br/>So, for clarity, I am defining a cooperative game as ones in which the players (and their characters) are on the same team working towards a common goal, and in which the conflict is generated by a source outside of that group.  I am defining competitive games as ones in which conflict arises based on the players (and their characters) having different desires and advocating for those desires.  In short, my cooperative/competitive distinction is based on the source of conflict in the game.<br/><br/>I'd be happy to revisit the definition if necessary.<br/><br/>- - - <br/><br/>If you're happy with those definitions, I am interested in hearing why you think the observation about creative vistas is utter bunk.

There are competitive ones and cooperative ones and ones that flop back and forth between them and ones that support both styles of play and ones that aren't really competitive or cooperative.  Some "GM-less" games have rotating GMs / antagonism, some have distributed authority, some operate by consensus, and others have explicit systems for negotiating contested outcomes, so it's hard to talk about them as a group.  For example, talking about 2-player games as being "GM-less" strikes me as a bit weird, but hey.<br/><br/>The most common type of GM-less play is probably online chat / forum / email / blog -based fanfic "games," and they don't have any of the traits you mentioned, so I'm not sure why we should expect tabletop games to be different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242878/#Comment_242878" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T09:34:41+00:00" title="November 20, 2009  9:34AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, I posted <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=28543.msg268456#msg268456" rel="nofollow">the same question</a> (almost) at the Forge a while back and came up with a few interesting ideas though nothing concrete or developed.

I envision players getting excited or energized as the threat increases because the rewards increase or because it's going to require a higher level of teamwork to defeat. I really like working together to defeat overwhelming odds, but not everyone does. <br/><br/>GM-less Agon would be my dream game. In fact, maybe that's a possible solution, to put the role of the <i>Antagonist</i> into the hands of the players where they must spend a certain amount of <i>Strife</i> per scene or encounter other-wise the amount of <i>Strife</i> increases in the next scene. Or maybe all unspent <i>Strife</i> is doubled and added to the final encounter.

You could flip the argument and use "competitive" to refer to a single play style (the conflict comes from resolving player disagreement) and "cooperative" to refer to anything else.  To me, that illustrates how there are fundamentally two sources of conflict in a game, and identifying the source tells us whether the game is competitive or cooperative.  It is therefore not narrow to describe games within that dichotomy any more than it is narrow to use "GM-less" to describe games without a gamemaster and "not GM-less" to describe everything else.   And, secondly, I think team-style play fits into many games, including D&amp;D:  I've run it in d20 Cthulhu, In Nomine, Lacuna, Burning Wheel, Cat, Dogs, Vampire, Secret Lives of Gingerbread Men, GURPS, Dragonquest, etc.   And, third, cooperative play also describes games like My Life WIth Master and Carry, to an extent insofar as both can have dramatic conflicts even if the players are all on the same side and all agree completely as to what they want to have happen. and neither can be described as D&amp;D-style team-play despite being eminently cooperative.<br/><br/>That said, I think I grasp what I am hearing you say, and I am open to alternative, broader definitions of cooperative play that also contrast with competitive play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242894/#Comment_242894" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T10:42:44+00:00" title="November 20, 2009 10:42AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>I'm not going to play a dating game unless it has at least three players and there are cavemen in it.</blockquote>\nYou're looking for Shooting the Moon, then.

In any case, take a look at public <a href="http://wyrmwood.mmo-report.com/playtest/ComingOfAge.pdf" rel="nofollow">playtest document</a> from a few years back (from before I decided to split the game to different settings). It is short, and should give you a basic idea about the non-competitive nature of play. <br/><br/>But be careful in drawing too much from it, there are a few subtleties to the game (even non-mechanical ones), and some important edits missing from that version of the rules. And I find that folks immersed in typical story game theory have some pretty off ideas about what the game play <i>must</i> be like. This may be part of the reason I can't seem to get enthusiasm in this community. But other sorts of gamers seem to play the game fine. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242917/#Comment_242917" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T11:41:32+00:00" title="November 20, 2009 11:41AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: phargle</cite>I am very curious about GM-less games that are neither cooperative or competitive.  I can't even envision such a game...</blockquote>\nHere, let me write you one right now.  It's just for two players, because it's an example, but this kind of thing works on a much larger and more complicated scale too.<br/><br/>- One player plays Batman.<br/>- The other player plays Robin.<br/><br/>Batman's player is allowed to narrate Batman beating the crap out of stuff and generally being badass.  Batman, however, is not normally allowed to talk.  He moves silently and effectively, leaving behind a wake of unconscious goons. Batman's player is also allowed to narrate bad stuff happening to Robin, such as him being captured or falling off a building or being mind-controlled by a hypno-ray.  That kind of thing.  Batman's player also has three tokens and can spend a token to have Batman say something dramatic, but no more than a dozen words (frex: "I'm the goddamned Batman").<br/><br/>Robin's player is allowed to narrate Robin talking, but Robin can only be described doing badass stuff that somewhat less badass than what the Batman just did.  If Batman takes out three goons in quick succession, Robin heartily punches a goon in the face, yelling "Take that!" Furthermore, Robin's player introduces new antagonism into the fiction by saying: "Holy _______, Batman!  [Crazy new antagonism]!"  For example, "Holy frying catfish, Batman! The Circus of Crime is attacking Gotham City's Christmas Day Parade!"<br/><br/>That's the whole game.<br/><br/>And what you see in these sorts of setups, which, like I said, can be much more complicated (involving dice, stats, etc.), is that each player is responsible for providing antagonism for the other players, by they are not actually competing, mechanically.  Batman puts Robin in trouble but then is most likely at least partially responsible for getting Robin out of said trouble.  And Robin ups the ante or introduces new problems, but then both heroes have to face those problems together.  So what a lot of GMless games do is make the players collectively responsible for both antagonism and overcoming the antagonism, but then dole out specific instances of responsibility such that you're avoiding the Czege Principle problem of resolving your own antagonism. There's an avalanche that affects all the players, say, but I'm chosen to play the avalanche in this particular case, even though I ultimately don't want it to kill us all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242926/#Comment_242926" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T12:26:27+00:00" title="November 20, 2009 12:26PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have always played Psi-Run without a GM.
