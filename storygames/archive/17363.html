I absolutely love the idea of storygames, but my regular play group is made up of very traditional board and RPG players.  They're not opposed to storygaming; we've tried Fate and Microscope, but the experience was a mixed bag.<br/><br/>Basically, the challenges are these:<br/><br/>1) These guys aren't used to being creative on the spot.  We had a lot of trouble in Microscope where people wanted to pass their turns because they couldn't think of anything.  Generally these guys work in non-creative fields and don't do creative/artistic things as hobbies, so I think a lot of this is just lack of exposure/practice. I think with more time at the table we'll be able to tell who's just not interested in this kind of gaming, and who's just unsure of how to go about it.<br/><br/>2) They seem to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">like</span> being railroaded, inasmuch as they're content to follow where the GM is dragging them without complaint (some of them play a lot of Pathfinder adventure paths, for instance).  Given an environment where they can do/define anything, they tend to scatter off and do their own thing rather than find common cause, or in a storygame sense a common theme/genre/premise.  Alternately, they end up with analysis paralysis and don't do anything. Again, I think this is more a lack of exposure to the concept, but there's some paradox of choice in there too.<br/><br/>3) We can generally carve out four hours once a week or so, but attendance isn't always consistent.  So something that can be taught and played in an episodic manner in a single session would be ideal.<br/><br/>4) They are fairly mainstream in their tastes in fiction as gamers go.  I mean, Grey Ranks could be the greatest beginner storygame on the planet, but I'm not going to be able to convince them to play a game about child soldiers in the Polish Uprising.<br/><br/>5) That said, one of them said unequivocally that he does not want to play any more trad fantasy.  By which I suspect he really means D&amp;D style fantasy, as he's the heaviest Pathfinder player.<br/><br/>There seem to be (ahem) a <i>lot</i> of storygames out there, and I've no idea where to start.  Is there a good storygame for complete beginners to the concept? Ideally something with a fair amount of structure and or handholding?  Thanks for any and all recommendations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393334/#Comment_393334" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T16:09:29+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  4:09PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2012 4:09PM by soviet.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking Dogs in the Vineyard might work.

This was the main game I used to introduce storygames to my group, and it's always been a blast. It does require the players to do things, but they have guidance on what they can do, and there's a built-in plot for you to follow should they desire you railroad them. I haven't played with variable attendance, but I can't imagine why it wouldn't work (also it's fine if not every character slot is filled). It's fantasy, but it certainly isn't traditional D&amp;D/LotR fantasy, more of a Final Fantasy + Firefly + Steampunk thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393374/#Comment_393374" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T19:41:21+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  7:41PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd recommend Dogs, Lady Blackbird, or The Shadow of Yesterday/Solar System.

That sounds fairly extreme to me! So I suppose it depends what you're looking for: with games like TSoY, Dogs, AW, etc, you can get more of the "story game" style of play for you as GM while still making it accessible to the players. But if you (as a group) really want to try a different style of gaming entirely, then go for it and embrace its challenges as well as its rewards.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393388/#Comment_393388" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T20:20:49+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  8:20PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ah, yes!<br/><br/>That method has a downside: more likely to fail outright; and an upside: you'll really know whether they're into playing differently (and can embrace it full-on) or not (in which case the game will fail spectacularly and you'll know not to try it again).<br/><br/></blockquote>\nYep, totally. Spectacular failure could be the result. The reason I picked Primetime is in the hope that everyone is so invested in the show that they forget they are playing an RPG. I know PTA was like this for me my first time. <br/><br/>To clarify, what I'm saying is "let them be frozen". Let them know that they can take their time with their ideas and that it is ok to ask for suggestions if they are stumped. I truly believe that for all but the most hopeless (stubborn?) cases, storygaming well is a matter of exposure for comfort and practice for skill.

I've seen people play that game where they start out saying, "Oh, I'm scared to narrate, so I'll just roll the dice during the game." But later, in the heat of play, suddenly they're more and more tempted to break that rule (you can encourage this as the GM in various ways), and discover that it's not so bad after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393398/#Comment_393398" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T20:50:09+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  8:50PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some good suggestions here so far but: Mouse Guard.

It's built for play without a GM, but it's pretty easy to hack one in. It's not majorly railroady, but the real appeal is that you're playing a disaster movie, so everyone knows the formula. Play is pretty structured - character scene, threat, character scene, threat, and so on - but the players have room to move within that structure.<br/><br/>The core book comes with skins for space, zombies, and snow, so you can adjust to the tastes of your group; it's also relatively easy to write up a new theme. (It's similar to Fiasco, in that a number of early elements are rolled from tables and then you play from there, with a new roll changing things half-way through.)<br/><br/>Like I said, what I think the real beauty for your gamers might be is the familiarity of that sort of movie. It can be hard to get into the head of, say, a night elf assassin, but everyone knows how to play the grizzled old guy who's doing it for his daughter and isn't going to make it out alive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393402/#Comment_393402" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T21:58:22+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  9:58PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2012 10:01PM by Joli.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World is a great pick for this; the only possible bug is also a feature: there is no plot for you to railroad them through, only a series of progressively worse crises that will continue to erupt, all the more so if they hesitate or ignore them. This could be great proactivity training, or maybe it won't and the whole in-fiction sitch will burn down spectacularly around them. Either way the game works and is fun, without you trying to "force" them to play a new way.<br/><br/>AW ties in with Jon's advice for soliciting creative contributions: you ask the players questions, addressed to the character, that flesh out the world and community. The questions are loaded and meaningful, and never yes or no: don't ask "did things go sour in a deal with Rolfball recently?" Ask "So why did things go sour in a deal with Rolfball recently?"<br/><br/><br/><br/>When you say they're quite happy to be railroaded, actually that makes me think of a few games that would in fact cater to that need.<br/><br/><a href="http://misspentyouth.robertbohl.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a> is a game with an episodic formula that basically plays out a cycle of rising and falling action, culminating in a onfrontation with an evil plot, no matter what the players or GM do. The meat of the game's choies isn't in where the plot goes, per se, but in what the Youthful Offenders will give up of themselves ("Sell Out") for victory.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.thievesoftime.com/news/cthulhu-dark/" rel="nofollow">Cthulhu Dark</a> is an extremely rules-lite investigative horror game whose slight mechanics do some interesting things in supple and subtle ways.

Because any story-arc is dynamically built at the table and any adversity is generated by the players themselves it taught us to appreciate the story as it unfolded in front of us ("play to find out what happens"). It also allows you to use a trad system for any fights, skills, characters or whatever. Obviously not for everyone.<br/><br/>Nonetheless as a fully signed up AW fan club member I also agree with that recommendation, IMO it is very natural to play for people used to trad games and yet opens up all these new vistas of possibility. As someone who learnt how to MC without ever having played in a game I can attest that it can be daunting but the advice here on SG is excellent.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be a 3:16 fan though. That fell flat for us. I think I can see what the rules are trying to do, but I think that it expects more from the players to go beyond the humdrum, and that could be problematic when you're starting out.  It is also meant for campaign play and the 1st mission is unlikely to work well without specific tweaks.<br/><br/>I do think this is a great question though because, IMO, many SG are at least one of: not fully polished, assume lots of prior knowledge or do one specific thing well and that may not be a thing your group is interested in.<br/><br/>So, what are your players interested in?

Totally agree with 3:16 since you can kill aliens first and the role play evolves from the down time between missions.  I strongly suggest Daniel Bayn's Wushu Open (a freebie.)  At first blush it might look like it's too open ended/creative, but you just need to remember the cinematic nature of the resolution system and your players will have plenty to inspire them.  Just choose a cool story based on a movie that they all like.  It also has a GM and that helps with more traditional gamers.<br/><br/>The four I was going to reccomend all have a fixed table order which is comfortable for board gamers.

It's a game where you tell the story of a post-collapse community by drawing the map of their area as you flip playing cards keyed to prompts.<br/><br/>I described it to my wife, who has similar fears about being put on the spot with creativity. She agreed that it would be much more up her alley than regular story games are. It might be a similar good fit for some of the boardgamers in your group.<br/><br/>But overall, the goal should be more about you and your group working together to find fun, rather than you pitching something that they grudgingly go along with.<br/><br/>As a storygaming noob, as you call yourself, Apocalypse World and Prime Time Adventures are both excellent reading material, even if the games themselves may be less about structured play than you are asking for. I've also REALLY enjoyed reading the Dungeon World draft versions that have come out - the final edit is due shortly. The principles in AW and DW are super useful as GM structures, and you may find yourself using them regardless of what you play. And PTA is amazing at helping you think about how to structure a medium-length campaign in a way that is likely to prove satisfying. <br/><br/>And Sorcerer is an older but also excellent example of learning how to drive play in the story games direction. Also excellent reading and guidance. And it has several supplements, which are WAY more about additional play guidance (for focusing on specific types of play) rather than "here's more badguy stats and player build options".<br/><br/>The danger, of course, being that if you read up on all of those and get frothing excited about that sort of play, and then struggle to excite your playgroup. So take your time. Try to get that guy who's overplayed Pathfinder to read some of the above and see if he gets excited about it too. If not, don't try to force feed your friends. That rarely ends well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393586/#Comment_393586" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-16T13:00:57+00:00" title="October 16, 2012  1:00PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2012 1:03PM by framweard.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With Jason's words in mind, I do still suggest Apocalypse World. "Playing to find out" can be done subtlety, and will feel very similar to the "railroad" plots your players seem to enjoy. You can seed a world with neat things, and based on what seizes their interest, you can all watch a plot develop around it.<br/><br/>When I first ran AW for my old D&amp;D group, if my players froze up at the story-now-ish-ness of the game, I would slowly introduce elements I thought were interesting until the players were also excited. Then we'd go from there.<br/><br/>By the time of our sixth or seventh session, I stopped having to do anything special for that crew. When I left them, they were planning out their own AW game entirely without me. Two years later, they play more story games than I get to! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>ETA: Failing that, grab Burning Wheel Gold and craft the fantasy setting that appeals to all of you. If trad fantasy is truly out the window, grab Mouse Guard and play tiny mice with huge spirits! The Burning system is probably the best way to introduce trad gamers to the small press scene around, if the GM is fluent enough with the game.

An old GMing buddy of mine once coined the aphorism "There's a difference between having nothing you'd <i>rather</i> do and having nothing <i>else</i> to do."  A  lot of the people in my gaming group and in the larger local community will say they'll play just about anything, but won't be very excited about anything in particular once the play actually starts.  There's also a strong element of "never criticize another person's game" in the community, so it's very hard to extract constructive criticism from people who didn't like something.<br/><br/>So while some of this is me trying to get my players interested in some of the things I'm interested in, yes, a lot of it is me trying to find something they'll be excited about.  I <i>think</i> they're all game to try this again, but as I said it's hard to get someone to admit they don't like a game.  I'm taking them at their word when they say they're willing to try something for an evening, and if it doesn't go well I'm not going to push it.<br/><br/>JDCorley, I've tried repeatedly to ask people what they want to play, but all I keep getting is "run whatever you want and we'll play it".<br/><br/>To everyone else: thank you for your suggestions.  I'm leaning towards <i>Gumshoe</i> and <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> because I think the setting will be most familiar.  I really like the ideas in <i>Apocalypse World</i> but I'm not sure about the post-apocalypse theme.  Can it be run with a Mad Max tone (gonzo action, more tongue in cheek)?  I think I could get them on board with that.<br/><br/>framweard: By trad fantasy I suspect that fellow really means D&amp;D's kind of gonzo dungeon crawling kitchen sink take on fantasy.  I suspect if I ran a faithful Tolkien-styled fantasy game he'd be good with that, so maybe BWG's worth a look.

When Dungeon World is out hard copy I think that would be a much better fit. For a group not used to story games I would suggest MouseGuard and use the pedagogy of play by Sean Nittner <a href="http://www.seannittner.com/pedagogy-of-play/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.seannittner.com/pedagogy-of-play/</a> it helps set the feel for them. The whole GM's turn Players turn is a real eye opener for someone just getting into story games. But I have seen time and again the first session of MG the players don't earn checks because they are counter intuitive. Even if you explain it, it's hard to get them to see. But after that it starts sinking in and then they will start looking for interesting ways to have their "long tail" trait get them into trouble. I also love Lady Blackbird, it is such a fun game. However a group that likes grabbing a seat on the plot train will bring that game to a grinding halt.

They'll engage and have fun and jump into full on.<br/><br/>We can't judge whether that's the case here or not (or at least I don't feel I can), but hopefully the OP can!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blurry" title="Blurry"><img alt="Blurry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blurry">Blurry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393704/#Comment_393704" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-17T13:41:29+00:00" title="October 17, 2012  1:41PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want a story game fix but you're worried your friends won't be into story games, maybe go for something with more structure and are a little more "game-y" - <i>Once Upon a Time</i> and <i>Aye, Dark Overlord</i> are improvisational storytelling card games that will go a long way towards seeing if story games fit with your group.

Dunno if it was just the people involved, but the setting information is so scant (except for super-specific rules and regulations for the Dogs) that I think everyone had different expectations and it clashed. If you bring DitV to them, my advice is to make sure that they're all on board for it <i>for real</i>, and that you all lay down a framework for the tone first. The game can be intense.<br/><br/><b>Everyone keeps saying Apocalypse World for a reason</b>; I think it's pretty easily grasped and a good introduction game. Since the post-apocalyptic thing isn't doing it for you, totally go for <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/" rel="nofollow">Dungeon World</a>. It's fantastic and most of the setting can be determined by your players, so if they don't want standard fantasy then they won't get it- everything is easily reflavored or changed. I think the *world games are a really good starting point in general; AW is the game that I used to get my group to expand their repertoire and it worked well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream" title="daniel_ream"><img alt="daniel_ream" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream">daniel_ream</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393890/#Comment_393890" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T08:18:36+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  8:18AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given that Borderlands 2 just came out and is occupying the attention of at least two of the group, I think I can probably sell AW without too much difficulty.
