Played in John's Clancy-world game of <i>The Regiment</i>, a little Parisian melody of carnage followed by a late night blood opera session of <i>Saga of the Icelanders</i>.  The next day I ran my somewhat raunchy hack of Lady Blackbird to an amazing group of players.  It being the first time I'd really ever run anything for any Story Gamers, I admit I started out with a small case of nerves, but things took off nicely and it turned out to be a smooth flight.<br/><br/>Thanks, all.

Mighty KBQX, 10 watts of throbbing television power, serving the Greater Albuquerque community! It's a playtest and I'm supposed to be paying attention how the rules work and stuff, but most of the time they just had me in stitches.<br/><br/>Before we started, Mike mentioned something about being rusty, not role-playing enough, and then immediately proceeded to rock it as the visionary but completely inexperienced new owner of the station, filled with grand ideas to "strategize!" and "monetize!" by moving the station to this thing called the Internet or (dum-dum-dum) basic cable! But he was also touchingly unwilling to abandon his childhood friend and hanger-on, Baker, even when it completely jeopardizes the station.<br/><br/>I loved that Abi's producer character was all power skirt-suits and hardball office politics on the outside, but secretly she had a school girl's undying love and faith in her kept man, a struggling stand-up comic who she really believed in with all her heart! She was also constantly embezzling from the station to fund her beautiful home and their decadent lifestyle together. But when she decided to abandon Albuquerque and follow her lover's dream to New York, Jamie's formerly sincere and trusting production assistant lost his innocence and blackmailed her with evidence of her embezzling so she wouldn't leave and let the station collapse. She didn't show up for their flight and she couldn't explain why she couldn't go with him, Casablanca-style\u2026<br/><br/>Oh, and I got to call our viewing audience a pack of idiotic, inbred harpies on live television. Fantasy come true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378949/#Comment_378949" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-19T18:59:33+00:00" title="May 19, 2012  6:59PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>Mike mentioned something about being rusty, not role-playing enough, and then immediately proceeded to rock it</blockquote>\nYeah, that's pretty much his M.O. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378962/#Comment_378962" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-20T00:56:00+00:00" title="May 20, 2012 12:56AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been refining my Tom Clancy-verse playset for The Regiment, thanks to feedback from players at NemoCon.
