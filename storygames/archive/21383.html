I don't know?<br/>I almost never end up in a big dungeon... the stories I GM and Play usually end up making more sense in the open, moving from one location to the next, meeting people, planning assaults... whatever.<br/>Actual "dungeon crawling" is a very rare occurrence.<br/>Maybe because treasure and monster killing are not such a big deal in DW, where they only exist as practical goals within a larger story.<br/><br/>The closest I got to playing in a dungeon was one time, I was the Fighter, and we ended up trying to negotiate with a sort of Goblin Sorceress worshipping a Spider deity of some sort.<br/>Obviously, we fucked up <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>When things went south we were in the middle of their "sacred temple" ... aka a system of underground caves and tunnels.<br/>We had to fight our way out.<br/><br/>But still... it did not feel like an old crawl.<br/>We did not trace a map.<br/>We did not look for traps.<br/>We cared little for looting and scavenging.<br/>We just wanted out alive, we faced enemies on tight corridors and caverns big and small, we caused a collapse to block one passage, we "<i>talked to the ancient stones</i>" to get info, etc.<br/><br/>It was obvious that the GM did not have a map or actually anythings pre-planned for this area.<br/>And it was perfectly fine.<br/>That's how DW works.<br/><br/>Still... I don't see a problem if the GM picks up an old module, with map and everything, and uses it as their prep. As long as the GM keeps following DW rules I can't think of anything substantial that would change. Or would there be problems of some kind?<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/>What is your experience?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468062/#Comment_468062" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-29T16:00:58+00:00" title="November 29, 2017  4:00PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the purpose of the setting in a "traditional" dungeon crawler isn't really as a locale or environment, but is actually a manifestation of the contrivances necessary for the game to achieve a sort of mechanical verisimilitude? So in a game like DW where the mechanical locus is more firmly rooted in the characters than in the world, there's not really a necessity for the physical locale of the setting to support the mechanics as much.<br/><br/>I'm just pulling this off the top of my head and don't feel comfortable making any grand assertions, but I feel like popular OSR concepts like "Gygaxian Naturalism" and "the Exploration Turn" could also be used to support this interpretation of the role of the setting as justifying the mechanics, rather than the arguably more popular idea that setting inspires them (a sort of orthodox understanding of "simulationism").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468065/#Comment_468065" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-29T19:05:07+00:00" title="November 29, 2017  7:05PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1<br/>The dungeon is an isolated system.

The best sessions in my campaigns were the ones in dungeons, as the resources and time available were limited, so some resource management was necessary. Exploration is easier to manage for the GM, and combats are riskier if PCs can't just make camp whenever they want. I know many of those things might be achievable in an open area adventure, but dungeons make it easier for the GM. I noticed DW started to seem clunky outside dungeons (that's when I started to miss Burning Wheel).<br/>What I did find is that my dungeons used to be smaller than my d&amp;d 3.5 dungeons. 5 rooms at most, while in 3.5 we had dungeon raidings that spanned across 2 sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468077/#Comment_468077" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-29T23:47:34+00:00" title="November 29, 2017 11:47PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mine is not a critique of DW, so much as a genuine practical question.<br/>It could be rephrased like this:<br/><br/>do YOU play dungeon crawls using DW?<br/>do YOU find DW problematic or not adequate for this purpose?<br/><br/>If so, tell me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>If not, tell me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468079/#Comment_468079" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-30T00:02:19+00:00" title="November 30, 2017 12:02AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't done it myself, but I know that some others have.

The style of play that late AD&amp;D, Dungeon World, Earthdawn and a gazillion other '90s D&amp;D clones share is sometimes called "middle school D&amp;D" (as in, neither old school nor modern), and it's perhaps something of a neglected style right now in the D&amp;D scene; even people who prefer it over other sorts of D&amp;D tend to end up in mis-matched campaigns simply because they don't know that their favourite style has a name and actual game texts that support it and so on. The fact that middle school is essentially the basis for what a normal traditional fantasy adventure game looks like doesn't help things, as it sort of gets lost in the crowd.<br/><br/>(For those who care about Forgite theory, middle school D&amp;D is fundamentally plot-based adventure Sim. It's quite different from e.g. old school, but it's old and historically overlapping enough for people to be confused with the playstyles a lot - many firmly middle school style gamers self-identify as old school, for instance.)<br/><br/>My top recommendations for gamers wanting to try some middle-school D&amp;D is to grab some iteration of the <i>Dragonlance</i> campaign and then play that with either <i>Dungeon World</i> or <i>Dragon Union</i>, which are, as far as I know, the current top systems for this flavour of D&amp;D. You could also use <i>Donjon</i>, but I think it's too freeform for most. Although most gamers have already experienced a "normal fantasy adventure game" like this, I think it's an educational experience to do it consciously and with appropriate tools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468170/#Comment_468170" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-04T03:28:05+00:00" title="December  4, 2017  3:28AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I agree with you in full.

I agree with both, for what it's worth:\n<blockquote>When I first discovered Dungeon World, I was skeptical. I was searching for new RPGs around 2013, and Dungeon World, of course, was all over the place. I looked into it, and found something... odd. I'd only had experience with D&amp;D until that point, and many of DW's differences made me nervous. You call actions "moves"? That's weird. Why was there no initiative? What, do people just go in whatever order they want? That's nonsensical. You have to roll to cast spells? You get XP for failing rolls? Alignment did essentially nothing? What in the nine hells are bonds?<br/><br/>Then I played an actual game, and I loved it. Everything ran simply. The focus on "Fiction First" was a breath of fresh game-design air compared to the D&amp;D "Rules for Everything" smog I'd been in. It was the first system that I felt confident running myself, because of how light, player-driven, and intuitive everything was. I heard some things about the "Apocalypse Engine", and the games derived from it, but in my mind, Dungeon World was its own entity, and probably surpassed the others. I had reservations, like I did with most systems, but even then it was my go-to for a couple of years.<br/><br/>About a year ago, I joined a story-gaming group. Every week, different games were run. <br/><br/>Eventually, I joined a game of Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>And everything made sense.<br/><br/>Moves. The lack of initiative. The "playbook" concept. The approach to stats and skills. <br/><br/>Even player motivation and worldbuilding finally fell into place. Apocalypse World wasn't just a well-made game. It was elegant, it was evocative, and it knew exactly what it wanted to do.<br/><br/>Compared to that, Dungeon World seems a lot less impressive. The spell system is clearly bolted on with little elegance. The stats make no sense - why are they 3 through 18 when they just need to be modifiers? Defy Danger is a decent attempt at porting saving throws, but it's unwieldy as all hell. Damage dice, HP, and coins are all bitty and unnecessary. <br/><br/>Sure, looking at it from a D&amp;D perspective, Dungeon World is incredible. But looking at it through an Apocalypse World lens, it's a great central concept weighed down with baggage from a game that it's desperately trying to fix and emulate at the same time. <br/><br/>Dungeon World just has too much Dungeon.<br/></blockquote>\nAnd a counterpoint:\n<blockquote>It's funny. Recently I developed the urge to run some old-school hex/dungeon crawling games, but Dungeon World wasn't Dungeon enough. The lack of a character power curve, flippant and largely useless economy, and no/poor rules for creating maps, traveling, and doing things in town. Fortunately, someone (Jason Lutes) made a few books to help with this and make Dungeon World lean much closer to the D&amp;D side of its heritage.<br/><br/>Why not work on just the opposite project: to make Dungeon World lean toward Apocalypse World? Ordinarily when I play Dungeon World, the little bits of D&amp;D seem annoying and unintuitive, such as Vancian magic and Hit Points. I'm sure plenty of people would help out, surely we aren't alone in feeling that Dungeon World occupies a strange middle ground.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468178/#Comment_468178" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-04T09:38:37+00:00" title="December  4, 2017  9:38AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> the idea of a "middle-school D&amp;D" makes perfect sense as a STYLE of play.

For starters, there's the pacing: a dungeoncrawl presents so many different problems to deal with on each room that the pacing speed is reduced to... a crawl. There's light, time, the presence or absence of monsters, smells, how much noise you make, how much tools you carry in vs. how much loot you want to get out with. <br/><br/>Then there's a whole different level of information play: there will be things the DM will tell you and others that he will hide from you until you 'make the right question' or search 'the proper place' in 'the right way', meaning that all this data is either prepared or randomly generated. <br/><br/>There are things that will be 'common sense' and 'common knowledge' fro dwellers of the setting that players are expected to know, since their character's will pay the consequences of ignoring, meaning that most usually players will discover and learn them the hard way.<br/><br/>The adventure is conceived and navigated in terms of hard facts, practical reasoning and careful resource management. In order to handle this gameplay you either use a heavy-rules system or end up generating one when enough house rules get piled up and the group has set precedents over how some things have been resolved before. Over that you need a big enough amount of prep, as winging up things and using quantum ogres is unfair to the players and detrimental to giving them <i>the experience of actual consequential danger</i>, which is one of the main feelings this gameplay tries to emulate. At least in what I would consider pure dungeoncrawl IMHO.<br/><br/>DW (well, PbtA in general) OTOH is focused on an entirely different direction. There we want interesting things to happen and we don't want a complicate procedure to justify their existence: Does it make sense in the fiction context? Then it goes. We want the whole story to make sense in dramatic terms, therefore we get rid of the random results, complicate procedures and cumbersome rules that end up producing anti-climatic story content. <br/><br/>Design-wise DW is particularly full of a cult, not exactly to the past, but instead, to the familiar. I'm guilty of that too design-wise, so allow me to explain: you are comfortable with some mechanics and have interiorized them to the point that just engaging them produce a particular feeling in you. So, you end up keeping them for the feeling you get, not for the actual feeling they produce by themselves. You see a familiar system, then you expect to behave like what it reminds you to. Then you end up not getting what you want and of course, your expectations are shattered.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal" title="yochaigal"><img alt="yochaigal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/885/nLZYCQ6WJ20JO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal">yochaigal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468200/#Comment_468200" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-05T00:16:14+00:00" title="December  5, 2017 12:16AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2017 12:16AM by yochaigal.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul_T...\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Eventually, I joined a game of Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>And everything made sense.<br/><br/>Moves. The lack of initiative. The "playbook" concept. The approach to stats and skills. <br/><br/>Even player motivation and worldbuilding finally fell into place. Apocalypse World wasn't just a well-made game. It was elegant, it was evocative, and it knew exactly what it wanted to do.<br/><br/>Compared to that, Dungeon World seems a lot less impressive. The spell system is clearly bolted on with little elegance. The stats make no sense - why are they 3 through 18 when they just need to be modifiers? Defy Danger is a decent attempt at porting saving throws, but it's unwieldy as all hell. Damage dice, HP, and coins are all bitty and unnecessary. <br/><br/>Sure, looking at it from a D&amp;D perspective, Dungeon World is incredible. But looking at it through an Apocalypse World lens, it's a great central concept weighed down with baggage from a game that it's desperately trying to fix and emulate at the same time. <br/><br/>Dungeon World just has too much Dungeon.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThis is exactly why we've been working on <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/111698539549372691411" rel="nofollow">Worlds of Adventure</a>. <br/><br/>Version .02 should be out shortly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468202/#Comment_468202" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-05T00:23:37+00:00" title="December  5, 2017 12:23AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/yochaigal" rel="nofollow">yochaigal</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Paul_T...<br/><br/> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Eventually, I joined a game of Apocalypse World.
