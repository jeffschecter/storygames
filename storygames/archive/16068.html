We've also got <a href="http://www.peccable.com/duchess" rel="nofollow">an informational page up</a>, complete with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nplNpBLi8ew" rel="nofollow">a video with us talking the whole project</a>.]<br/><br/>The long(er) version:<br/><br/>Something like five years ago, my partner, Neil, just after finishing work on the printed version of his role-playing game ACE, asked me if I'd run a one-on-one RPG for him. I hadn't done anything like that in a very long time, and so I quickly agreed. Neil brought a character - Duchess - that he had in mind, along with a sketchy back-story. Having played in Waterdeep when he was a kid, we quickly gravitated towards an urban campaign -- one giant city that contained the whole of the adventure.<br/><br/>We had a blast.<br/><br/>I was just getting to the point where I really felt like I'd unlearned all the bad habits I'd picked up in my early RPGing career. I tended to gravitate towards the whole "lonely fun", build-an-entire-world-and-its-five-thousand-year-history-before-anyone-even-makes-a-character style of GMing, which usually led to all sorts of railroading whenever my pre-created world was threatened. This time, I decided, I was going to be open to anything and everything. Neil, on the other hand, had started gravitating away from his more gamist roots and was ready to try something a little more narrative.<br/><br/>It was a perfect fit for both of us. We slowly learned about the character and the world she lived in. We played in adventure after adventure, story after story, and had a blast doing it. The city and its history deepened, the NPCs showed facets of themselves I'd never imagined when we started, and slowly an over-arching meta-plot evolved -- the kind of thing I used to make before even starting a campaign.<br/><br/>We've played in this world for over five years now, and about three years ago I decided that I'd love to give Neil a gift that was some physical artifact of this thing that we'd had so much fun making together. So for NaNoWriMo, I wrote a novel based on the first adventures Duchess had.<br/><br/>I was assisted in this by the fact that, since I have horrible memory, I'd recorded every single one of our sessions. Hours and hours of recordings of us playing the game. I sat down and transcribed all of the sessions I needed, and used it as a basis for the book. I was so grateful to have those notes -- so many things had happened so long ago that I had completely forgotten. Wonderful little ideas, and details that might have otherwise been lost made it into the book.<br/><br/>I gave Neil a copy for Christmas, with a promise that I'd try getting a POD version.<br/><br/>Neil had other ideas.<br/><br/>He saw the skeleton of something more. The original book, written in 30 days, was the beginning of something, not the end. He asked if he could look it over, add some things.<br/><br/>Before we knew it, we were engaged in a full-time rewrite. And at one point he just looked at me and said "You know. I think this is kind of good. I think someone else should see this."<br/><br/>We went through draft after draft and then, when we felt comfortable enough, we tried approaching some publishing houses. That got us a little bit of attention, and the names of some agents.<br/><br/>And every single agent/publisher we sent the book to turned it down.<br/><br/>OK, we thought, we'll just self-publish it.<br/><br/>And then the day after we decided that, one of the real-life-honest-to-god literary agents (with an office! In New York!) we'd contacted got back to us and said they wanted to work with us.<br/><br/>And then seven months and countless revisions later, we didn't have an agent anymore.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, we decided after that to just go with the self-publishing thing. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>It's been an amazing experience. It's been fascinating to see what worked in the story-as-game that translated perfectly over to a novel, and the parts that didn't work, and the parts that needed to be changed, or modified, or reordered. We found characters and scenes that had more depth than we knew when we played, and others where I literally turned what was said at the table into dialogue.<br/><br/>It's been a hell of a trip and I've enjoyed (almost) every minute of it. Having a real, physical copy of the book is amazing. We ended up working with the incredibly talented Amy Houser (who you might know from the sketches she did for <a>Daniel Solis' Do: The Book of letters</a>) to do both the cover and a map of the city and they're just incredible.<br/><br/>I'd love to answer any questions about the process -- the game, or the novel, or the whole eBook thing: the process of turning the game into prose, what working with CreateSpace (who we're doing the trade paperback through), or KDP, or PubIt, or the IBookstore is like, what's involved in laying out an eBook (ePub, etc) is. Whatever, really! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As I noted in the short version, we're making the first four chapters available for free. We'd love to hear what you think of it.<br/><br/>And we're already hard at work on the sequel! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-d-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366231/#Comment_366231" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T09:19:02+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  9:19AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If this were 4chan or someplace of that ilk, I'd post an animated gif right about...

We are proud that we saw this through. It's been a long road.<br/><br/>Writing this post was way more difficult than I'd imagined as well. I REALLY didn't want it to sound like an ad, but I still wanted to get the word out there about this project. Get people seeing the sample chapters, seeing what we'd done. It's hard to wrap my brain around "advertising" something that's so personal. Has anyone here run into this? The whole "here's my art, please like it!" thing? And how not to make it sound like some obvious bid for attention?<br/><br/>Both Neil and I have been playing RPGs and other games-that-tell-stories our entire lives. For me it started with Interactive-Fiction (what we're now calling what I used to know as "text adventures" in my childhood) -- these tiny little worlds you could give to someone else and they could explore. And I've watched as both of us have grown in that - the influence we had on each other as players, and later as writers. <br/><br/>And story-games (and, to a lesser extent, The Forge) was a big part of that. There was a period of about a year where everything for me was Big Theory, trying to put everyone in little boxes on how they played. I finally had a language that I never had in high school or college about how we played, or what we were trying to accomplish when we played.<br/><br/>I feel like I've gotten to the point where that conversation - and seeing how people interact at the table, what they're there for, what they want out of play - has become incorporated into myself much like muscle memory. It feels like when I've memorized a piano piece -- thinking about the notes, the specifics too much messes up the music. You just have to sit and play. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyway - thanks for your kind words. <br/><br/>And Colin: thanks, I think? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Your post is the first time I can remember feeling Old on the Internet.

It was probably an outgrowth of my "lonely fun" GMing style that in my writing, I'd get caught up in building worlds and of COURSE anyone who was reading what I was writing would be just as invested. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  It's great to see that that the effort we put into pacing the background is paying off.<br/><br/>I guess there's a parallel to the way we played the game. The background that's in the actual book wasn't there when we first played those first scenes between Duchess and Hector or Duchess and Lysander - it came through in actual play. The context evolved as we went. Sand under your feet.<br/><br/>Michael: Sorry you're having problems getting it where you are. I'm still working on finding an expanded method of distributing the book. The IBookstore is driving me mad - they put up a ton of hoops for you to jump through and constantly remind you that you're better off using a third-party rather than working with them directly. After a while, you start to agree with them.<br/><br/>Has anyone used SmashWords or a similar aggregate service?<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368499/#Comment_368499" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T12:55:32+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 12:55PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finished it -- liked it a lot!

The second book is proving to be much more complex than the first -- multiple threads running in concert, rather than the simpler, single thread of the first. Not really sure when it'll be done. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Glad you enjoyed it though!<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368519/#Comment_368519" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T14:35:39+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  2:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read it in Kindle format on my phone, as my walking around, waiting in line, odd free moment book.  It took me a bit over a week to read it, but I was reading it in snatches.  I liked the hints of a more complex back story -- the mysterious master(s) of the gray, whatever the heck happened to the Domani, the odd touch of magic associated with the dagger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
