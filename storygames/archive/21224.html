The latter is a moderately simple matter, but the former is rare, probably because many rpgs are written for different purposes than mine, and therefore I do not appreciate their literary merits.<br/><br/>Examples of games that are not D&amp;D and that nevertheless have setting material that I find relevant:<br/>- Delta Green<br/>- Pendragon<br/>- Glorantha<br/>- Paranoia<br/>- The Shadow of Yesterday<br/>- Ars Magica<br/>- Amber<br/>- 2300 AD<br/>- JAGS Wonderland<br/>- Mountain Witch<br/>- Polaris<br/>- Nine Worlds<br/><br/>There's a lot of these when all's said and done, one can't say at all that I would only play settingless games. But the setting needs to be good, and it has to have a purpose in the game for me to bother with it. It is true that there are many rpg settings that struggle to justify themselves.<br/><br/>I'll repeat it, because it cannot be said enough times: the vast majority of rpg setting stuff is vile, useless and infantilizing of its audience. RPGs are at their most annoying when a lot of work is invested in utterly unremarkable or actively vapid setting fluff. Often the absolutely best service a designer can do to my purposes is to just give me the rules and let me plug in something I consider a good setting. I will often be left cold by stuff that people generally consider good, so it's really not that worthwhile to try to woo me with setting. Much easier to give me a good system and let me figure out myself what I'm going to do with it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465132/#Comment_465132" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-29T09:24:47+00:00" title="July 29, 2017  9:24AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal reading of the zeitgeist is that trad gamers are tending to go to more streamlined systems but want to see a good deal of fluff in the products they buy.<br/><br/>That is, a lot of heavier rulebooks these days seem to be under 20% system with the rest being setting. <br/><br/>I personally have been specifically criticised for producing a game with good rules but with minimal setting included. (My steampunk game - The Code of Steam and Steel - entered for the UK Games Expo awards a couple of years ago. Almost every judge liked the game but said they wanted to see a specific Steampunk setting included. It MAY have been a Steampunk thing. It's a bit.... undefined...... as a genre.)<br/><br/>Evidence would seem to be the continuing success of GURPS which is pretty much all settings, and the fact that the success of Traveller and  Runequest was base as much upon their systems as their settings.<br/><br/>Three things need saying here (which I think echo what Euro has already said):<br/><br/>1) The rules need to absolutely reflect and magnify the setting. I've been into SHRPGs for a number of years and can tell you that you need different rules systems for different iterations of the genre. Not just different games for Marvel and DC. I've written different games to simulate the comics vs. the TV series.<br/><br/>2) There are loads of existing ISPs out there and people are happy to buy games to simulate Dr Who or Star Wars etc. So, yes, people do buy setting materials.<br/><br/>3) With there being so many extant ISPs/Settings why not just use one of those rather than a bespoke setting? A bespoke setting needs to be original, playable and necessary. Most of the "new" RPG settings are cookie cutter and - as Euro has already said - not worth our time.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465133/#Comment_465133" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-29T11:06:36+00:00" title="July 29, 2017 11:06AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just an observation:<br/>A lot of the best settings were created before the rules/system and without a rpg even in mind: Glorantha (Runequest), Arthurian Britain (Pendragon), Star Wars (various games), and Middle-Earth (various games), etc.  The Blades in the Dark/Ghost-lines setting seems to be currently popular, but that seems to be the exception that proves the rule, IMHO.

You can certainly make a game that just provides rules to handle the genre in an interesting way, then sell it to people already engaged with the genre. If you're not good at writing material able to inspire the readers you're probably better just pointing the readers to your inspirational sources instead. I've also seen the opposite cases, where the author provides a really interesting setting but the rules don't deliver, so readers end up switching to another system. It's the difficult part of handling a mixed media such as RPGs, you need to get right many things: the rules, the setting, the art, the presentation of the game and the organization of all that information.<br/><br/>In my case I end up reading setting stuff only enough to understand how the game is supposed to work. If it's inspirational enough maybe I'll keep reading, and then if I feel is likely my group of players don't know anything of it I'll probably use it. Otherwise, I'm with Eero, I hate to read a big chunk of bad literature that most probably will put me off of trying to play that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465141/#Comment_465141" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-29T23:51:07+00:00" title="July 29, 2017 11:51PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I generally agree with everything that's been said.

I'm gonna find out this winter when I release <i>UbiquiCity</i> - a setting and sourcebook with no particular game rules in mind.  It's all culture, technology, factions, plot hooks and NPCs, and although it's set in particular fictional city ("UbiquiCity" is the colloquial name of the setting that appears in the upcoming science fiction anthology of the same name), it's also flexible enough to just take elements from, dropping them into any near-future campaign.  To cover all bases, I'll also be including rules for "ubiquitizing" your own cities, either real or fictional, so there's no need to use this one particular city just to enjoy all the genre and tech stuff.  Fingers crossed, and I'll report back when I find out. :-)<br/><br/>PS -- Remember those little system-agnostic Palladium books?

Information has natural presentations for humans who access that information, so when writing game texts you should figure out how the text is supposed to be used, and go with that. For some games that means integrating the rules and setting, while for others it means separating them.<br/><br/>For example, consider <i>Ars Magica</i>: it would be ludicrous to separate the setting stuff from the rules, as the rules system is so organic. Something like 80% of the game's rules are just mechanical presentations of setting phenomena. Separating the two would mean having a setting fluff section, and then going over the precisely same things again, except this time with numbers.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I prefer my Glorantha materials rules-free: I seem to dislike every official rules system that exists for the setting, to different degrees, so the less they come in the way the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465146/#Comment_465146" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-30T07:16:11+00:00" title="July 30, 2017  7:16AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2017 7:17AM by BeePeeGee.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely Yes!!<br/>More specifically, I'm interested in two things:<br/><br/>1) Setting material or pre-gen characters I can reuse for rules-light playing.

I have purchased Middermark, and I have purchased Traveller stuff (though I also have no interest in The Third Imperium setting, but I'm happy to mine the various supplements and adventures for stuff I can re-use in my own  setting).<br/><br/>The Wilderlands and Blackmoor are both setting-lite, which makes them very attractive. I should also note that to some extent, I use Glorantha in a setting-lite fashion. I do use all the cults for RQ, but really at the mostly mechanical level. I like RQ as a rules system, and I like how the cults work (RQ2 to be specific) and I have no interest in trying to work up all of that stuff myself.<br/><br/>So the settings I use are those that provide an interesting map, with interesting places indicated, but leave plenty of room for me to take it an run with it, and not get bogged down in debate about the setting.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465193/#Comment_465193" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-31T17:22:37+00:00" title="July 31, 2017  5:22PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The setting material I have enjoyed most in recent years has been <i>Dresden Files</i>.

Oh well.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465617/#Comment_465617" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-15T02:46:26+00:00" title="August 15, 2017  2:46AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2017 2:59AM by David_Berg.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think my most common usage is something in between "existing world with backstory, history, locations, and factions" and "in-house world building".

Simply having a tone and genre, even a pretty distinct tone, wasn't what I had in mind for this post, but I recognize that there is still a spectrum of examples that many would consider a setting. <br/><br/>In terms of the settings you have used and like, what I am getting from a lot of you is: <br/>-If its interesting to you, your more likely to use it, <br/><br/>-Or when the system and setting theme are inexorably tied and/or enhance one another.<br/><br/>-Less is more (unless the above two items are very true for you), that means enough to keep the prep low and provide interesting seeds but not so much that your reading novels<br/><br/>-Popular existing worlds not tied to a particular system are used as well, with a preference for well developed worlds that were not designed with a game in mind.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465635/#Comment_465635" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-15T16:01:02+00:00" title="August 15, 2017  4:01PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of people have actually asked us to produce an edition of Ars Magica that doesn't have Mythic Europe as its setting, but is instead set in some other quasi-13th century fantasy world or another. Or perhaps in a different time, such as the 18th century. There are sufficient numbers of people who don't think that ArM's rules portray Mythic Europe so much as they portray a system of magic on top of a fairly standard skill/ad/disad rules set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465737/#Comment_465737" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-18T10:17:32+00:00" title="August 18, 2017 10:17AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, myself, enjoy rather broad settings that allow me to improvise.

We freeformed it, but the setting contributed a tremendous amount to the game, and gave us a common base to build upon.  I was surprised how much this helped with our common understanding of the underlaying setting details, and kept us on the same page as we built our characters and narrative.  It also has the effect of giving us a common sense of what the world was like outside our little corner of Mars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
