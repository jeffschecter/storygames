This is a clean slate to let the community know what we're doing and invite anyone interested in spectating or participating to join. \n<blockquote>We are using IRC exclusively, and the game is open to all comers.<br/><br/><a href="http://irc.lc/ircnet/habavaara/irctc@@@" rel="nofollow">Habavaara.</a> <br/><br/>If you have a standalone IRC client, or want to use a different web client, the info you need is:<br/>server: open.ircnet.net<br/>channel: <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23habavaara&amp;Mode=like">#habavaara</a><br/><br/>If you have some kind of technical problem that's stopping you from connecting, feel free to contact me via PM, I'll try to help you through it.<br/><br/>If you have doubts whether you'll be messing up our fun, don't.

As always, happy to GM if nobody else is ready to go. I'm not comfortable playing before Sunday (too much work), but next week is again a new week, and it will be easier to entice me to play.<br/><br/>Nothing against <i>World of Dungeons</i> in principle, but I'm not interested in splitting the creative energy between multiple mutually incompatible processes; a full-blown old school sandbox campaign is one of the deepest, most complex rpg endeavours in existence, more than enough of a challenge without dispersing attention by trying to share the spotlight between several campaigns at the same time. Of course one could bring in WoD ideas/elements, but at a point where one could call it "playing WoD", it'd be far detached from the Moldway-based developing conventions of the campaign. It'd lack synergy with the work already put into the project, I would expect.<br/><br/>(That's not to say that alternate GMs and new mechanical, topical, procedural ideas aren't welcome - to the contrary, I think the process is very open in that regard. It would be best to approach it with the attitude of GMing <i>this</i> campaign, though, rather than using these resources - player base, scheduled time-slot, shared venue - to run something else. And this is of course just a personal declaration of interest, which has nothing to do with what others might want to play.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430194/#Comment_430194" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T15:26:35+00:00" title="March 28, 2014  3:26PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I'm with Eero on this one, just for the record!

(This could be fixed by making the docs editable for whitelist-only, but that in turn would cause overhead in having to authorize everybody in turn as they participate in editing.) One of those docs is a joint character sheet/table that people fill in with their characters.<br/><br/>Chargen is near Moldway standard, but not creatively dead, so it's best to do it at the beginning of a session, or before the session at the IRC channel - you can come in whenever, pretty much, and it's likely that somebody will be able to help with it. (By the chargen not being "creatively dead" I mean that it's not like a 3rd edition by-the-book D&amp;D campaign where you can just read a book line by line and arrive at a complete character. Assuming that you want anything at all beyond a standard 3d6-in-order stat line, it's good to have another player familiar with the campaign to vet your ideas.)<br/><br/>In practice creating a character takes like 10 minutes, or 5 if you know what you're doing, so it's not an issue to worry about. The game's style discourages speculative pre-play, so it's not even particularly desirable for players to create characters several days in advance, so they can then stew slowly and grow attached; it is a possibility that your character dies at the first concrete move you make in the game (has already happened like twice so far), so it's better in some ways if you create the character when you need it. (I'm phrasing it like this because of how the normal reasons that games have for favouring pre-creation of characters are somewhat antithetical to the philosophy of this game. "Character discovery" is pretty important as a facet of play, which is why chargen is practically a part of play, not a pre-play chore.)<br/><br/>In practice: just get on the channel and ask about chargen whenever, and you'll be taken through it by whoever happens to be online. It's not a problem to appear to play character-less, it can be done easily enough in the middle of a session, too. Somebody always has enough time to instruct on it while the others carry play, even if the game has already begun by the time you arrive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430205/#Comment_430205" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T19:33:00+00:00" title="March 28, 2014  7:33PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, in the spirit of advertising the actual content, a few words about the substance of the campaign so far. Anybody wants to chat/comment a bit more about the actual sessions and what we've learned about them, feel free to add in details. I would be personally particularly interested in hearing about what's working and what's not working for individual players, insofar as the actual creative content goes. For me, I'm especially happy with how the setting is taking shape, how flavourful the player characters are, and what good sports everybody are about the high level of challenge in this sort of game - it's clear that we're working with experienced roleplayers who don't hesitate to put their mark on things <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>We're developing a make-it-up-as-you-go sandbox setting that falls stylistically into a niche sort of halfway between old school pulp fantasy and Gygaxian D&amp;D fantasy; it is a comfortable place for old D&amp;D editions to be in, to tell the truth. It's got things like demihuman player characters, relatively common magic, publicly acknowledged "dungeon weirdness" and so on that you'd expect from TSR fantasy, but it also has realistic and grim social elements such as racism, corruption, violence, religious bigotry and such. Essentially, it's an interesting blend of whatever each player happens to have brought into it. Most importantly for me personally, it hasn't given me that feeling of unthinking religious crypto-racism that TSR D&amp;D often evokes with its alignment-based arbitrary kill orders for different types of non-humans, thanks to a sufficient level of social realism being present ;-)<br/><br/>The setting mostly has an identity in terms of being the sparsely populated "northern coast" or "northlands" of an imperial polity of sorts. In the first session Mike made the mistake of answering too slowly when somebody asked about the background for his "wizard fort" dungeon, so our ouija board quickly sketched in a bit of history about an ancient "wizard war" between the "Lords" and the "wizard federation", about these lands having been under occupation ever since, about an essentially monotheistic/pantheistic Taoist-style Church created as a sort of counter-balance for the multitude of wizard-cults awaiting the return of the wizard-kings, and so on. It's a bit of a locally post-apocalyptic setting with a dash of Tolkien, surreal underground fantasy and pulp tropes, where old ruins of the federation era still hold artifacts to be seized, magic-users are in turn respected or feared depending on the grasp the Church happens to have on your local hamlet, plate mail is amusingly cheap because of on-going scavenging of ancient battlefields, and so on.<br/><br/>Our play so far has centered mostly on the astoundingly poor and isolated village of Grey Sands, whose only claim to fame is pretty much that it happens to be across the bay from the Seafort, an ancient ruin dating to the days of the wizard federation. We don't know what's in there in fact (except Mike does, it being his adventure), but we suspect that it was pretty important for the last defenses of the wizard-kings in the war, so could be anything - even council chambers of the Council of the Wise, the ruling body of the federation. So much knowledge of those times has been simply lost during the reconstruction era. We do know that the demihuman tribes seem to have gotten intensely active about the place lately; aside from individual, tight-lipped adventurers like Bodigon the dwarf, we've encountered entire crews of halflings and elves keen on penetrating the Fort; I personally suspect that they know of something momentous that the human adventurers don't, for it is rare for an elf to risk themselves like that for shallow reasons.<br/><br/>Aside from the wizard fort, we've been doing some hexcrawl and urban adventures on the side, for variety and to explore the setting - I've been running sessions when Mike's been otherwise engaged, essentially. The woods inland from Grey Sands are heavily fae-infested for good or ill; there are dangers, but the truth is that the elves are one of the last truly beautiful and good things remaining of the federation era, what with the wizard-cults having largely descended into degenerative demon-worship and hostile superstition under southern pressures.<br/><br/>In the last session we explored the occasionally referenced "provincial capital" of Carrion, the only larger city in the local theater of operations. It's basically a Lankhmar/Sanctuary knock-off, fit for all sorts of urban adventuring. The city has ancient heritage, for it's essentially the old civil capital of the war-era federation, then going by the name of Enharza; it was ruled by no wizard-king, but their civil government with its high king or governor ruled from there, allowing the wizards their elitist peace uncaring of the fate of the mundane man. A quite flavourful place.<br/><br/>Insofar as success goes, last session's medical mystery was the first truly successful adventure that wasn't a solo session, as a few player characters survived and successfully explained the mysterious illness of a merchant factor's daughter. The most successful characters so far are almost half-way to 2nd level, so it is conceivable for one of them to make it, at least if there were another successful adventure in their immediate future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430208/#Comment_430208" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T05:05:24+00:00" title="March 29, 2014  5:05AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2014 5:08AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this description, man. I'd say that's the long and short of it. <br/><br/>I guess as the other DM (so far) I should probably just round off the above with a few notes from my perspective. <br/><br/>Going in I'd focused on Moldvay dungeon generation, really wanting to nail the dungeoncrawl procedure. So I'd been generally agnostic about setting details, letting the tables imply stuff about the fiction. This is how we've ended up really focused on Demihumans and Magic Relics - supposedly the justification for these regular high fantasy occurrences is a apocalyptic war between normos and wizards, some of which may or may not have occurred in the Dreamlands, where Elfs come from. There may or may not be Ben Kenobi-esque wizards wandering through Time and Space trying to undo the present. It's implied that the Last War of the Wizards was totally bitchin' and involved a great numbers of lasers, flying techno battlecastles and really off-the-chain pyrotechnics. V. last hours of Krypton meets Flash Gordon. It would be a terrible, terrible thing if the PCs somehow got their hands on a way to, say, wish themselves into the past and disrupt the outcome of events (poss. become legendary heroes/rich/their own ancestors/vaporised by the time masters). Really, the setting is a secondary concern and can just about transport us anywhere it needs so long as we're still thinking about dungeons/challenges and dragons/events.<br/><br/>The idea is, I suppose, to encourage people to make and run dungeons. This means that the fiction'll get dragged all over the shop as everyone pitches in trying to justify the next character or the next wandering monster. <br/><br/>Just to pull back the DM screen for a second in regards to the Wizard Seafort: I'd not built it with any kind of fictional intention. It goes up a few levels and down a few and, typically, shit gets harder the deeper you go. There's no Wizardlord entombed in magic ice written in yet, not even the slightest hint that the setting generated after the dungeon has yet been drunk back in and moved things around. The passage to the topmost level and the bottom most are blank, of course. Who knows what the players expect to find in these places - maybe they can offer their suggestions for a random table? 1d12 determines what's in the top-most and deepest room of a dungeon.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430209/#Comment_430209" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T05:19:35+00:00" title="March 29, 2014  5:19AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Mike missed last session where half of the party ended up taking a trip into the Dreamlands.

That aspect of the adventure was directly inspired by Mike's earlier character creation effort - I'm all for mixing up dreamland'iana here, it being a long-time topic of study for me.<br/><br/>And yes, in practical terms I am of course aware of the nature of the Seafort, I'm just engaging in constructive denial when I speculate about what might or might not be there. Up to the GM to decide whether they want to revise parts of the scenario, and in what conditions, to reflect the process of setting discovery on-going elsewhere.

A more cynical and goal-oriented crew would have declared long before that they're doing things A, B and C, and then leaving to hexcrawl for that Sidhe pool of power.<br/><br/>Color-wise I like GMing hexcrawl quite a bit, it's enjoyable to see the hexy world open up hex by hex. As I don't have any notes or anything, it's all up to fitting together a puzzle out of the adventures I'm planning for the area, and pure random improvisation. I suspect that these "Old Woods" that proved such a doom for the poor hobbits will feature more later on.<br/><br/>(Yes, Zzarchov and his gang met their untimely end, the fools. They just couldn't resist a critically successful Charisma check, so left to explore the woods instead of going home as they've been planning for multiple sessions already.)<br/><br/>Oh, also - easily the most brutal monster of the campaign so far was discovered!

I've actually never done Hexcrawling (ever!) whereas Eero seems to drive his sessions into dungeons infrequently. I'm actually very jealous as I felt last night's crawl was slow, fruitless and muddled in so many ways - I think Hexing sounds less demanding on the DM. Or procedurally less rigorous, perhaps? The players aren't expecting to be shuffling along in a methodical fashion and the passing of information is less crucial? <br/>There's a danger of this campaign shifting away from the hack-n-slash megadungeon conception I had at the start and moving to a more setting-driven overworld-focused game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Perhaps dungeons could be parsed into 150' hexes (1 hex-move per turn) and generated Hex by Hex as essentially a hyper risky underworld travel map?

Trying to design whether the campaign's supposed to do this or that in a top-down manner would basically be trying to put controls on the natural process of discovery.<br/><br/>(Yes, I sound altogether laissez-faire at times when discussing D&amp;D. A lot about my attitudes towards the game is about fixing yourself so you don't mess with what ain't broken. Get the process right, and you don't need to worry about the outcome.)<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I do run dungeons, but as we've seen, I also don't shy away from a pretty heavy front-load of maneuvers before play ever gets to that dungeon entrance. Basically, I try to let the players loose as early as possible, long before they get to that dungeon. Sometimes that means that they never do, and there is certainly plenty of interesting stuff to do in an adventure fantasy setting outside dungeons, too. And of course here I haven't particularly pushed dungeon content over other things, as we have the Seafort representing the big, fat dungeon angle.<br/><br/>And yes, there would seem to be a lot of support for an earlier starting time. It might not be a bad idea to schedule a session for e.g. 6pm GMT, four hours earlier than the usual has been. I'm actually somewhat vague as to where that late time-frame came from - I guess it's mostly Daumantas and the Trans-Atlanticans for whom it suits well <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430309/#Comment_430309" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T06:44:16+00:00" title="March 31, 2014  6:44AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not saying it's broke per se, just slowed in the format to a point of not really delivering as promised.

But I've considered that long inn scene a lot and I have some thoughts about it. I feel that Arsuin's quest was in a way struggling against the game itself. I mean, it was described as a sort of a poke at the hardcore HP rules, right? That seems like trouble.<br/><br/>Eero wrote above that we needed to be reminded of our goals. I can only speak for myself, but I wouldn't describe things that way at all. I went into a conversation far enough to be told that there wasn't any treasure there, and then was done with the scene. What more is a thief to do?<br/><br/>I was a bit surprised (and other bits of conversation between Eero and I established this a little bit more strongly) by the idea that such a magical place wouldn't have gold sitting around, because that is my mental model of D&amp;D. But it seemed like there was not much of a common goal for our characters.<br/><br/>I think with a greater number of players to make it seem more fair, or with a little bit less time having been spent establishing Arsuin's pool as the frame of the episode, I would have been very happy to announce that I wasn't that interested in going there (or perhaps that someone else would have cut in at that point and said it for me\u2014it could have been a flag for someone less invested in the scene). Instead the right thing to do seemed to be to let Paul do his thing, play his game that was not quite the same as mine until a chance to line them up again came up. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that he thought he was waiting for me to accomplish something\u2014or perhaps that this fact that to me seemed pivotal was just a passing conversation to the others?<br/><br/>To me it seemed pretty clearly like the end of the conversation: we were talking about directions to adventure sites, I had been offered two others and had said that I was more interested in this one, and the only response was that there was no treasure there. And\u2014as far as going blindly, I did have the hope of a random encounter table featuring lairs or something else interesting, as well as accomplishing some exploration of the world as well as the systems. I'm not sure what your procedures look like exactly for hex stocking, so this might have been putting too much trust in my own feeling of "what D&amp;D is", in systems that I don't know for sure to exist.<br/><br/>But I don't think either Paul or I were not focussed on goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430333/#Comment_430333" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T10:55:14+00:00" title="March 31, 2014 10:55AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I agree with that assessment, Adam!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430334/#Comment_430334" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T10:56:49+00:00" title="March 31, 2014 10:56AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone is reading this, DWeird and I are online right now, and will be for the next few hours.

For example, it is conceivable that skinny-dipping in such a magical pool could simply just give you experience points. Or you might grow wings. Or die. Who knows. Point is, going for such a pool would probably appeal some characters more than others, depending on how interested they are in the eldritch and the unreal. It is not, however, the case that not having gold available is automatically a reason for an adventure to not be of interest to an ambitious adventurer.<br/><br/>But yes, I'm totally the sort of GM who'll give you an adventure that has no gold. It's up to you to refuse it and go for something else instead. Admittedly this might cause conflict between characters, but that's just a matter for negotiation. "Hey, my character is not interested in this pool thing. How about I create a new one who is. Or your character could instead go sell glassware to the indians with me, instead of this stupid pool thing."<br/><br/>Admittedly that doesn't always work to everybody's satisfaction, but from my viewpoint this is also the case with e.g. authorial decision-making (to pick at the solution that TSR chose later on for how D&amp;D should make everybody happy all the time): I could no more align your characters by micromanagement than you could do it yourself, ultimately. At least with creative freedom to maneuver we can sort of say that what we accomplish is real, and reflects our mutual input into the process of play. Sort of the same justification that democracy has: might not cause the best results, but at least you get what you deserve.<br/><br/>Well, in fact I guess I could sort of try to make everybody happy by promising magical potency to those interested in such, and gold for the rest just 'cause a proper D&amp;D adventure has to have gold in it. That's how a TSR adventure does it: there's this slave population needs saving, and coincidentally the slavers have a big fat pile of gold, too, so you're motivated to go save those slaves. Feels strange to me creatively, but admittedly there is that option if you're willing to compromise on setting logic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430339/#Comment_430339" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T12:19:36+00:00" title="March 31, 2014 12:19PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, "Bottled magic water" sounds exactly like "coin" in my ears.

How well-informed do you expect the characters to be, in typical play, about adventure hooks and possible rewards? In the game so far, for instance, we've pursued various adventures, but had, at best, a very vague sense of what the rewards might be (with the exception of being hired, of course, when a price is decided upon) and how dangerous the adventure might be. <br/><br/>I could see this developing in further play (now we know, for instance, that the Dark Woods might hold a Black Beast or whatever that thing was), but initially, at least, it feels like we're just grabbing at whatever's available, for whatever reasons we want to cook up (e.g. my character Arsuin, I decided, was obsessed with the concept of rejuvenation). Is this something that just comes with time (as the players learn about the milieu and their surroundings), or is it a failure of the players in our case (perhaps in your "typical" game session, the players ask a lot more questions and leave better prepared!), or something else? How well informed are players in a "typical" scenario, when you play in this style, about an upcoming adventure hook?<br/><br/>2. In terms of offering multiple adventure hooks to the players, how prepared are you, as the GM, to follow up on each one? Are you trusting your own instincts and creative abilities and just brainstorming a few possible adventures ("Hey! How about some halflings who need an escort?"), or coming prepared with several modules, and finding a way to plug each one ("Here's an NPC who wants to look for the Tower of Live. Anyone want to go with him?"), or something else?<br/><br/>What's this side of the game look like from "behind the screen"?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430342/#Comment_430342" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T12:46:21+00:00" title="March 31, 2014 12:46PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TSR adventure design is not where the expectation of treasure comes from. If we're creating characters with Moldvay's rules, an expectation is present about other parts of those rules (Basic page B52, and Expert 28 as well as of course in monster descriptions). All versions of D&amp;D have a direct relationship of some kind between monsters, adventure sites and treasure. Those aren't things from modules or whatever, they are rules. They are a little different in all versions though, so whatever, but if you want to say "oh well, you could have just gotten exp for it!" I feel like you are talking about nothing at all, because that was certainly not an established or expected fact, and seemed to run counter to the information that we did have (which described the pool in instrumental terms for Arsuin).<br/><br/>But yeah\u2014I was totally up for going there anyway, obviously\u2014and to try to make something of it either there or on the journey, like bottling the water, yes. I felt that I had agreed basically well before that point to go along with Arsuin's quest, and I wasn't unhappy to do so in the way that we did.<br/><br/>We talked a lot about succeeding or failing at social challenges after the game. I wish we had failed harder; I tried to make us fail harder. Because I was trying to make something happen\u2014I felt like I had been told that I wasn't getting directions from those guys, which maybe was a miscommunication, but in any case I had had my fun talking to them about the locket and other sites and was uninterested in pixel-bitching for the right words to use. I felt quite frustrated when my second attempt to cause a scene and force us out onto the road again ended in NPCs deciding that it was forgivable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430344/#Comment_430344" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T13:04:20+00:00" title="March 31, 2014  1:04PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>1.

It's a give and take: if the players ask for more info before they commit to the adventure, and the GM feels that he can reveal more (on the basis of credible information sources and actually having something to share), then they get more information. If they're happy to go adventure with less background knowledge, then that's fine, too.<br/><br/>As with most things, I find this a part of the negotiation primarily because of how we do not actually have answers as to what is "enough" in terms of information and risk-evaluation. I'm sort of like that economist who refuses to put a price on a pint of butter, because I think that the entire machinery of the market is there solely to answer this extremely complex question: don't ask me to determine the price of butter by fiat, for if I could, I would be like the gods themselves. The best I can do is to set up a self-correcting machinery where players will presumably achieve an ideal balance of information.<br/><br/>Considering yesterday's session, I can assure you that I've seen even more blind play. From my viewpoint it generally looks like players get into these kinds of "intelligence slumps" because they're expecting the GM to sort of carry them. This is a bit embarrassing, I have to admit, as you sort of feel bad for the naive players who are clearly not thinking things through, but you can't really intervene without reducing the fidelity of the scenario. When it feels too much like shooting fish in a barrel I generally do try to make sure that the players have really realized that hey, if you're not going to take care of this thing, nobody is, and you're all just going to die of thirst out in the desert, or whatever.<br/><br/>From my viewpoint yesterday's performance, as I indicated, was amusing, but not dramatically off the scale. I hope that it didn't feel too arbitrary or unfair, for I believe that this kind of play improves as players learn through failure: next time around you'll have a much, much better sense for what to look out for in terms of possible reasons an adventure might fail for.\n<blockquote>2.

How about some halflings who need an escort?"), or coming prepared with several modules, and finding a way to plug each one ("Here's an NPC who wants to look for the Tower of Live. Anyone want to go with him?"), or something else?</blockquote>\nThe vast majority of the adventure hooks I offer have existing backing in the form of a prewritten adventure. Some hooks are in fact different perspectives on the same adventure. Some few are hooks without an adventure; in some cases I have the time to either select or create the adventure itself, while in other cases I'm forced to improvise. I have done a fair amount of improvising in D&amp;D - our big campaign, which was sort of an OSR breakthrough for me in certain ways, was an exception in this regard really - so I'm not afraid to do an improvised thing.<br/><br/>For example, the urban medical mystery adventure in Carrion (and the city itself, in fact), as well as this pool of power thing, were both essentially improvised; both include premade materials blended in there where opportunity beckons, but in both cases more than 50% of the GM lines were original material. In both cases the hook suggested itself first, and then I either improvised material or melded in stuff that happened to be at hand.<br/><br/>Zzarchov and his halfling escort is an example of an "adventure" where the reason for Zzarchov's escort thing is a real adventure (<i>Lamentations of the Gingerbread Princess</i>, although I suggest you not look that up unless you want to spoil a major campaign element) - or actually a couple adventures - while the escort hook itself was improvisation. I just wanted a reason for the party to go where the adventure is, and the halflings, having been introduced earlier at the Seafort, suggested themselves as a natural vehicle. We have actually not touched the adventure for which I took up those halflings; everything done with them so far has been incidental consequences, including the Hidden Trollop.<br/><br/>The Tower of Love (<i>Tower of Duvan'Ku</i>, although again I recommend against spoilage if you want to play), on the other hand, I pretty much presented according to the text; there's been like 2% of improvisation in presenting that material, and that mostly concerning how the adventure proper latches onto the hexcrawling system.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are plenty of differences in how premade material and improvisation relate to the sandbox, case by case. The general goal is to present a world of adventure where the players have negotiable freedom; the means are improvisation, a library of material, and negotiating with the players. I admit that I don't do much "hard" limiting of player focus, and I tend to "flavour" the stuff I offer in various ways, but it is an entirely legitimate move for the GM to be more open and technical about his negotiation. You could just tell the players that you have these three adventure modules here, and which one do you wanna play - being theatrical about how exactly adventures float up to PC conscious is entertaining, but it's definitely not structurally mandatory. I can do it because I have a bit of a library, a solid head for improvisation, and a very high personal valuation for an organic sandbox environment; many GMs would choke on the idea of e.g. letting players just <i>think</i> that there is an adventure somewhere because they listened to the wrong NPC, while for me something like that is entirely natural as part of organically negotiating a challenge environment into existence. It pays off long-term, even if it might mean that a session or two are spent chasing after red herrings.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430347/#Comment_430347" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T13:21:23+00:00" title="March 31, 2014  1:21PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good answers, Eero!

My brain would probably break if I tried to GM the game strictly as written, to tell the truth - and I wouldn't have too much fun, either. For the longest time I thought D&amp;D a pretty dumb game, and it was only when I developed my own constructive reading, which does throw out all sorts of textual basis, that the game started working for me. Personally I think that my interpretation of the game is more "real" than most TSR texts in terms of making sense and reflecting what a successful GM actually does, but that doesn't make it any more more textual, obviously.<br/><br/>I guess the key is to note that when I've characterized this IRC campaign as being "based on Moldway" or "using a Moldway chassis", I at least haven't intended that to mean anything except the superficial mechanical conceits the game uses, such as the way attribute bonuses are calculated, or the spell and equipment lists. The actual game system process is something more fundamental than any single technical text of D&amp;D. I haven't even read the GM section of Moldway yet <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>To be completely explicit: I did not intend to critique player performance above, where I characterized the events of yesterday's session. As far as I'm concerned the play was fine, flavourful and entertaining. I just meant what I said, that it was very interesting to see how it went, and where it failed, even if my perspective on the causes of failure might not be the whole truth. The GM is something of an on-looker in this style of game, in good or ill; you just bring the scenario and see which way the players pounce. In this case the scenario was far from Moldway standard, as can be seen in the fact that it wasn't set in a dungeon to begin with.<br/><br/>For after action analysis, I should say that the hunters you interviewed about the pool were basically willing to tell you anything they knew. You just never straight out asked them for directions, perhaps because of the deep IC paradigm of the discourse. The closest you came was when you asked about whether it was in the western woods, and they told you that no, it's in the east, in the deep old forest. I'm sure that the in-character paradigm of communication was a trip-up there as well - we could've dealt with the hunters in a more abstract manner ("I go and talk to the hunters - GM, tell me what they know about this topic X"), too, but as you started in with IC dialogue, I answered in kind, and that meant that the discussion meandered here and there. Interesting meandering, though - they'd have never offered to show you stirge nests, or to take you with them to sell glass-ware, were it not for the more detailed discussion.

May the deaths be few and far between.<br/><br/>However, all this has got me fooling around with some D&amp;D hacking myself. I might just start a thread about that. I'm noticing how bizarre the D&amp;D system is - although it's simultaneously remarkably difficult to improve! There are so many little design features which don't seem obvious at first: for example, just how little variation there is in characters, despite appearances to the contrary. Since you roll stats on 3d6, but test them on 1d20, the range from an unusually competent character (say a 15) to an unusually incompetent one (e.g. 5 or 6) is only a 45-50% difference or so in possible outcomes. That's significantly less than is present in a lot of other systems. For example, if we look at the odds of a failure in Apocalypse World, it ranges from 72% (for a stat at -2) to 8% (for a stat at +3), and that full range doesn't even get covered in typical play.<br/><br/>The difference between the most competent warrior and the least competent (if we're looking at ThAC0) is perhaps only 15% or 20%. Same goes for saving throws; other abilities, like your chances of triggering traps or finding stuff, are identical or near-identical for all characters. This seems like it plays well into a "challenge the player" philosophy.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, however, arguably the most important characteristic at first level is a character's hit points. Here, for some reason, we have absolutely no qualms going from someone with 8 or 10 hit points (a warrior with good Constitution and a good roll) to characters with only 1 or 2 hit points each! Suddenly we're seeing something along the lines of a 800% difference between characters?<br/><br/>Stuff like Prime Requisite bonuses (I still do not understand the purpose of this rule at all, unless it exists solely to incentivise people with a particular high stat to play a certain class - and whyever would you need that?) also work to create divergence between characters.<br/><br/>This has inspired me to come up with a simple hack:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>D&amp;D Hit Point Pool</b><br/><br/>Every character has a dice pool which represents their ability to survive. This pool consists of 1d6 per level + your class die + a die derived from Constitution (a d6 by default, but increase or decrease die size by one category for each Constitution bonus - so a character with a 14 Constitution and +1 bonus would get a d8). <br/><br/>You do not roll these dice when creating your character; you just write it down. <br/><br/>Let'say I'm a first-level Thief with a poor Constitution. My hit point pool is a d6 (for being a 1st-level character), a second d6 for being a thief, and a d4 for my Constitution: 2d6+1d4. That Con 14 Fighter might have 1d6+2d8 instead.<br/><br/>You also have a certain number of Hit Dice. Initially, this is 1.<br/><br/>When your character gets injured, we need to see if they survive. You roll your hit point pool, and keep a number equal to your Hit Dice - usually this means you just keep the highest die. The threat or enemy rolls their damage. Subtract damage from hit points, as usual. If it hits 0 or less, you're dead. If not, write down your remaining hit points: this represents the extent of the damage. <br/><br/>Let's say my 1st level Thief got hit by some kind of monster which deals 1d8 damage. I roll 2d6+1d4 and get 4, 5, and 3. The monster rolls a 4. Subtracting 4 from my highest die (a 5) leaves me with one hit point: my Thief got hit pretty hard and is very nearly dead!<br/><br/>I have 1 hit point until I get some healing.<br/><br/><b>Healing</b><br/><br/>A full healing process (taking however long, with proper care and resting) leaves a character completely recovered. Erase any current hit point total on his sheet. If the character gets injured again, roll his or her hit points then.<br/><br/>Minor healing, like first aid and a bit of rest, restores 1 hit point, but only to a maximum of 4.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I kind of like this; first-level characters don't have to deal with the ignonimity of rolling a 1 for hit points and being stuck with it for life. They're a bit more durable! And with leveling, their durability increases, but only very slightly. <br/><br/>However, this is balanced with a daunting truth: because you roll your hit points each time you're losing a violent confrontation, there's always a chance - however small - that any hit can kill you. I like this; no longer can you walk around with your 9 hit points, secure that you can take that arrow without worrying about it. There's always a danger, instead.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430507/#Comment_430507" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-03T22:09:03+00:00" title="April  3, 2014 10:09PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2014 3:17PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Improvement</b><br/><br/>* Each time you level up, you can add one die of your class size OR upgrade any existing die in your hit point pool by one die size.<br/><br/>So our thief who has 1d6+1d4+1d4 would go to 2d6+1d4+1d4 to maybe 3d6+1d4 to 1d8+2d6+1d4 and so on.<br/><br/>However, as you get to higher levels you can also:<br/><br/>* Iinstead of adding or upgrading a die, <i>remove</i> the highest die from your pool. In exchange, you can increase your Hit Dice number by one. <br/><br/>EDIT: You must always have at least two dice in your hit point pool for each Hit Die. So, two keep two Hit Dice, you must have at least five dice in your pool (so that when you remove one, you'll have four left).<br/><br/>So your 4th level Thief from above could be rolling 2d6+1d4 at first level, 3d6+1d4 at second level, 1d8+2d6+1d4 at third level, and at fourth level he could decide to upgrade his Hit Point pool to 1d10+2d6+1d4, or go to 2d6+1d4, but keeping the best two dice.  <br/><br/>(All in all, the "feel" of this kind of campaign would be similar to "E6". But then I've never personally understood the appeal of epic-level D&amp;D - for my tastes, I've always felt that things kind of broke down at that point, the numbers got too big, combat became a grind, and so on.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[OSR Actual Play] Greysands Campaign -

I'm not a contrarian, I'm just great believer in advocating for the devil. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Any proposed changes could probably do to keep the boons of OSR conservatism in view. <br/><br/>I don't know if early level characters being (a) statistically similar and (b) statistically prone to failure is a bug or a feature. I think it adds a certain structure to early level play characterised by essentially unheroic characters who aren't much different from the man on the street just starting to be introduced to a world of adventure. As levels are gained the characters become more embellished fictionally and variate from one another to a greater degree. As Attribute Stats don't grow with level in B/X, at least, the Prime Requisite rules offer numerical granularity to similar PCs - anyone can be a fighter, but a fighter with high strength will grow 5-10% faster than his weaker counterpart. Specialists are created over time, rather than introduced up front as in later editions of D&amp;D. <br/><br/>Your proposed changes are interesting but if I wanted what you want it would probably be less effort to begin play at a higher level (Gygax himself, legend goes, had a houserule that PCs start at lvl.3).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430536/#Comment_430536" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T11:30:14+00:00" title="April  4, 2014 11:30AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2014 11:38AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I appreciate the Devil's advocacy, that's always welcome!<br/><br/>I agree with all your comments about the curious nature of D&amp;D, and how's it worth preserving, although I still don't really see the point of the prime requisite bonus: surely having the high stats appropriate to your class's pursuits should pay off in better survivability and more experience point gains anyway?<br/><br/>As for the hit points issue, I've played OSR-style D&amp;D with the "start at 3rd level" rule in action, and it's a decent fix for certain perceived issues, but I think mine is better. As you point out, by 3rd level characters are already specialized and drifting into their special roles, further and further apart. They are more complex and character "building" can already start to become a desired thing.<br/><br/>More importantly, they are still either a) impervious to most attacks (if they roll well for hit points, they know they can, for example, take a couple of arrows point-blank and be guaranteed to survive) or b) hopelessly fragile (if they roll poorly for hit points), with no way to change that or improve their condition. I'm not fond of that aspect of D&amp;D, personally; I'm growing more and more enamoured by the slight variation in ability which brings to the fore player skill and strategy over character builds. I don't see the need for a 3rd level Fighter (who already has better weapons, Strength, and armour) to have 20-28 hit points while his companion the wizard has 5. I think a range of roughly double would suit the game just as well.<br/><br/>[I've settled on a method for hit point improvement in the meantime, and edited my earlier post to reflect that.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430538/#Comment_430538" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T12:16:02+00:00" title="April  4, 2014 12:16PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I still don't really see the point of the prime requisite bonus: surely having the high stats appropriate to your class's pursuits should pay off in better survivability and more experience point gains anyway?</blockquote>\nIt's an artifact from OD&amp;D. By the brown books, Strength didn't give any kind of bonuses to-hit or \u2013damage: so that XP bonus was the main way that it produced better survivability. It's precisely because Hit Points are such a major site of difference, too: it was a way for that stat to give you more of them by levelling up faster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430540/#Comment_430540" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T12:19:23+00:00" title="April  4, 2014 12:19PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2014 12:20PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

Good job, one of the few successes in the campaign so far.<br/><br/>The only human adventurer in the party, Escargot the fighter, got his just rewards in the form of a precious gem that the elves gave him in thanks for escorting Lark on his dangerous mission.

Compare the highest die rolled to the damage: if it is better than the damage rolled, the attack can be ignored (the character has shrugged it off). If it is equal to or lower, discard that die from the hit point pool. Subtract its value from the damage, and compare the remaining damage to the next highest die.<br/><br/>Healing works by restoring dice to the pool.<br/><br/>So, for example, if my pool is 2d6+1d4, and a monster hits me for 1d6+1 damage. The monster rolls a total of 5. If I roll a 5 or higher on one of the dice, I'm fine. But if I roll poorly - let's say I roll 4, 1, 1. The 4 is lower than the damage, so I lose that die. The remaining damage is 1, which knocks out the second die. I'm alive, but I only have one die remaining for the next attack.<br/><br/>Interesting. Has some similar features to my idea, and some slightly different ones. (Models regular accumulating/ascending hit point, in that regard it's just like regular D&amp;D.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430601/#Comment_430601" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T02:36:02+00:00" title="April  7, 2014  2:36AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Saddened I missed playing with you guys last night.<br/><br/> I won't go into my misadventure but it involved being stranded 250 miles away from home, food poisoning and youth vandalism of our public transportation services.

E.g. a player retires their character and rolls up a ship's captain who is positioned to own a vessel within his starting fiction (this is seemingly good fortune, but should probably be a matter of responsibility for the player). <br/><br/>Is this a path only to blatant self-love and false challange, or might it be possible with a healthy mindset and good communication about meaningful activity?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430630/#Comment_430630" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T11:17:30+00:00" title="April  7, 2014 11:17AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Not asking you to defend their point of view, but just trying to understand: What was it about the caller role that made them feel as if their agency was being reduced?<br/></blockquote>\nLiterally because it was seen as limiting their ability to speak and have agency of action whenever they wished.

My own experience has been that this arrangement emerges naturally around the ~20th session of play anyway, if the group does high-maintenance procedural dungeon-crawling. We never explicitly chose a caller in Upper Savo, or here in Helsinki - it's just happened because it's more efficient to play that way. We get more done, and the players actually have an easier time when it's clear who has the responsibility for driving forward. Trying to do without feels a lot like trying to have mapping happen by just having "everybody map". You can see the psychological and logistic issues with that.<br/><br/>As for play, I'm cool for later in the week. Sunday's as good as any day. I can run stuff unless somebody else wants to try. I think we can find excuses for hex-crawling, or ocean-crawling, or savage turf war in the Old Woods (or Carrion for that matter), as well as other possibilities. Anybody wants to set something up in advance (that is, create characters,  negotiate adventure hooks, gear up) is welcome to observe the IRC channel and ambush other players for negotiations. It's always quicker to start actual play if the logistics phase has already been done beforehand, and it's one of those things that IRC makes easy. (As a side effect: a GM who knows a couple days in advance about what play's going to be about can actually prepare something in advance, too. Not that you can't prep for an open sandbox, of course, but more focused prep is more focused prep, even if I'm personally all too often too lazy to do anything with the opportunities.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430643/#Comment_430643" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T13:59:00+00:00" title="April  7, 2014  1:59PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, actually there's no reason why I couldn't throw out some notes about adventure hooks here. Ask about any of these in detail in IRC if you feel like it, or complain to get more:<br/><br/>An adventurous ship captain in Carrion is hiring free blades to join them in a "considerable venture", with ship shares available for the wealthy or those bringing special talents. The captain, one Samson Off-the-Hook, has a reputation for exploratory trade with the wizard refugia, making him a suspect man in the eyes of the Archon, but a romantic figure for those yearning for the days of the federation. However, Samson apparently has had trouble getting takers for his latest endeavour, for one reason or another.<br/><br/>Another, much duller shipping mission is also leaving Carrion soon; it's heading towards Moriarty, a distant trading post on the north-eastern coast, a place of rising importance in the furring trade now that the southern demand has largely exhausted the capacity of the province to provide. Captain Melchior Harker is a southerner, but capable of navigating the icy northern waters after 15 years largely developing this trade. For one reason or another, they're offering free board to sturdy men willing to join them, no questions asked.<br/><br/>(Those are both obviously major undertakings, not one-shot adventures or anything close to such. Doesn't mean that they can't be sampled, of course.)<br/><br/>Carrion is obviously a city of adventure in the vein of the likes of Lankhmar and Sanctuary and such; an environment I'm pretty fond of myself. I'm sure we could arrange for entanglements of exciting variety therein, like we did earlier in the Affair of the Pseudodragon. Some hooks are out in the wind, in fact, even if not all players are aware of those...<br/><br/>Sniper Joe's map might potentially involve hexcrawling, should it be solved. Who has the map now?<br/><br/>Yeschant and Lark of the western elves are apparently moving into the Old Woods near Irllendom to lay claim upon the woods. I'm sure that this'll be a famous adventure. Likely their last <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>A story has been floated about the abbot Sibalius and his wondrous wine cellar. A light-hearted, alcohol-saturated adventure rumoured to present access to a bottle or more of the miraculous Vivamorte vintage.<br/><br/>I've also got pretty good stuff brewing in Irllendom, it's just that nobody's managed to get that far yet. I'd be happy to have any reputable characters join Jimgrim the merchant at Carrion to journey with him there. There's no pay for "caravan guards" on this secure road, not with Jimgrim a master merchant himself with a seasoned crew, but you'll have experienced company, you'll be fed if you can either handle the animals or carry a weapon, and he's willing to take any who stick with him down south across the wastes free of charge <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Regarding the eastern lands and hexcrawling therein, my understanding is that they're predominantly unbroken, non-civilized wilderness when you get inland from the coast, dotted by abandoned ruins of wizard-king era, and hardliner federalists and outlaws who prefer living out on the mercies of the forest savages and such. Not many civilized destinations that way, nothing rivalling Carrion (although Irllendom might apparently find its match in one more barony in the east), not unless you count the dwarven closures further east, in the mountains.<br/><br/>The major southern trade cartel LONTH has maintained a reward of 10 000 ecus going on a decade now for finding a safe way through the wastes that'd link up the south-eastern trade hub of Fergana with the ruins of Crashior, a major wizard-king citadel and a dominant source of wizard scrap (trade term for scavenged wizard-king artefacts); the two are both well east of Carrion, but with the dangerous wastes separating them (with some particularly nasty local dangers in those parts), trade in scrap is forced to use the western route, which chokes that entire trade fiercely considering the prices that scrap fetches down south.<br/><br/>(For those not familiar with old school sandbox adventure negotiation procedure: those hooks all represent adventures, or adventure-like pastimes, that I personally am offering to run as GM if you find any of them worthwhile. I'm keeping most of my cards hidden for now regarding each individual adventure, of course, to maintain the fog of war; further knowledge about the detailed possibilities of each adventure waits upon intelligence gathering of whatever sort. You may consider the fact that I chose to trot these hooks up here instead of some of the ones you've seen earlier an accident of expressed interests - people have been speculating about ocean adventuring, for example - combined with my own.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430649/#Comment_430649" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T18:26:45+00:00" title="April  7, 2014  6:26PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In this game, where at least you and Mike are GMs and it seems like anyone is welcome to just jump in and run stuff, how are map-rights negotiated?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430662/#Comment_430662" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T00:09:59+00:00" title="April  8, 2014 12:09AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm keen on rolling up a new character to join either of the seafaring adventures, or some other trekking.

If it's just general interest in the setting, then I'd invite the group to help draw one (rough features such as coastlines, interesting landmarks, etc.). If it was to ascertain some specific strategic point, I'd attempt to answer in the specific as well, without drawing out an entire map. If the adventure at hand basically required you to amass a lot of specific geographic information, I would sketch you a map (no need to expect perfect detail, of course) using the ordinary combination of means. Ideally I would of course already have the map at the ready, if I had been attracted to GM an adventure that required you to have a massive amount of geographic information.<br/><br/>In the most drastic case I would call for recess while I worked out a map; as has been discussed in IRC, it <i>is</i> theoretically possible to run against the edge of the render zone in my sandbox GMing by moving very quickly, to a very unexpected direction, in a manner that makes play impossible to continue without major prep. (I won't claim that it is easy - I am pretty good at improvizational sandboxing by this point in the game.) Ending up in a situation where you absolutely have to have the best map available in Carrion, representing the entire northlands, would likely be exactly such a situation. In practice I'd suggest that we finish out the session playing something less labour-intensive, and then I'd come in with the map for the next session.<br/><br/>In our home game I would generally have had geography worked out in advance for the immediate areas of interest, so I could answer questions about it without any fancy footwork. Of course there as well players could always ask questions that I did not have prepared answers for - that's an inherent state of GMing a sandbox campaign, though, so no big deal. My experience is that players are generally implicitly cooperative about these matters, which is also carried here in the Grey Sands game - nobody has felt a great need to push at the edges of the currently on-going simulation just for the sake of pushing it, even if most characters would have plenty of rights to have wider knowledge about the world if they were to just ask.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" rel="nofollow">Potemkin</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, I'm interested in place-names.

I'm myself working backwards from proven cases in figuring out how the naming goes. For material I have player choices (particularly in character names), co-GM choices, the adventure module stuff I'm using (Duvan'Ku is an infamous thing of LotFP lore, for example - not a name I invented), and my own improvisations. Over time these turn into tendencies, which might end up so strong that they'll start overriding e.g. adventure modules. For example, I've sort of figured out that the southerners tend to have more biblical and generally European names, while fantastic sounding (and yes, Finnic) names are somewhat more likely for northerners, particularly low-class and rural people. Northerners are also more likely to have descriptive names, perhaps because our viewpoint is somewhat northern here, and thus we translate their language into English more often, or perhaps because the cultural purge following the wizard wars broke much of the continuity in the local culture, so that they tend towards simpler plain-speak naming conventions nowadays instead of using old classical language names so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430669/#Comment_430669" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T03:49:04+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  3:49AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A question for you Eero, if you can answer in a way that does not spoil the play in the IRC game: How many of those hooks that you are offering are backed by published modules, and how many are adventures from your own brain?

I think I answered this exact question in IRC last week regarding the adventures we've already seen in the campaign. For these hooks here, let's see... three are predicated on pre-existing material that is not adventure modules (meaning stuff like ready-made hexcrawl milieus with no particular adventure structures attached), one is an adventure I've written myself before (and playtested, too), four are basically improvisation exercises for me (although I might jot down some notes if I feel about it at some point), and there are about five specific adventure modules involved behind the rest of the hooks. Some of those are obviously such that there's room for me to fit in arbitrary adventures later on if I feel the need, and I do have some on the sidelines waiting for an appropriate place to introduce them. About half are such that if anybody else feels like GMing something related to those hooks, go right ahead - my ideas concerning them are easy enough to recycle and use somewhere else, insofar as I even have more than a confidence and curiousity regarding the specific subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430684/#Comment_430684" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T07:06:47+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  7:06AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> About half are such that if anybody else feels like GMing something related to those hooks, go right ahead - my ideas concerning them are easy enough to recycle and use somewhere else, insofar as I even have more than a confidence and curiousity regarding the specific subject.</blockquote>\nThis is the official call for a player (or potential player) quorum on sea hexploration adventure!

So, for instance, Eero's been talking about Irllendom for a while, so I'd imagine most GMs would either avoid placing it on the map, or, if forced to, would place it somewhere appropriate to what Eero has described so far.<br/><br/>I can imagine a FEW problems potentially cropping up through this method, but none of them seem all that dangerous.<br/><br/><i>On an unrelated sidenote, I've been thinking about the hit point pool idea I mentioned earlier and fooling around with it some more. I don't think anyone reading actually cares, but I'm going to describe my latest idea, just for completeness. Feel free to stop reading if you're not interested in this! It's getting less and less D&amp;D-like, I'll admit.<br/><br/>I think so far my favourite version of it is pretty simple: when a monster attacks, it rolls its damage (almost always a d6, I think), and the player rolls their die pool. <br/><br/>Any dice which do not beat the incoming damage are discarded from the pool. When you run out of dice, you're probably dead (follow your usual rules for running out of hit points). If you matched the damage total with your highest die, then you're just knocked out (like 0 HP).<br/><br/>So, for instance, your pool is d8+3d6+d4. You get hit, the monster rolls a 3 for damage. You roll a 5, a 4, a 3, a 2, and a 1. You discard the 3, 2, and 1, leaving you with two dice. You get hit again, and you roll two 5s, but the monster rolls a 4. This time, it's just a flesh wound. The third blow is a 5; you roll a 6 and a 1. So you discard the 1, leaving you with one die. The fourth strike is 3 damage and you roll a 3 - you're knocked out.<br/><br/>It's much more random than the other methods (any blow can kill you, and even when you're severely wounded you can get hit several times and survive if you roll well), but an interesting application of hit dice. It would work really well for monsters' Hit Dice, I think, since the GM doesn't have to track any numbers, but can just leave the dice on the table.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430767/#Comment_430767" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T18:47:57+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  6:47PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm down for some wavecrawling, if the timing works out (I'm in California, and the difference from GMT has meant I've only made one session so far).

From my viewpoint the supposed starting time doesn't matter that much, the game starts anyway when enough people show up, no matter what's been declared the official starting time. The nature of this game is such that one doesn't exactly need to wait for another player to play their turn.<br/><br/>As Jonatan says, the practical start has often occurred at about 8pm GMT, which is still almost reasonable for us here in mid-European zones. Some people seem to only come in at like 12pm GMT, which is likely a feature of the trans-Atlantic time-zone contrast (for the Americans that's barely in the evening). Basically, a four-hour zone during which players show up, and play has usually been going for hours when the last ones show.<br/><br/>Being early gives one quite a bit of voting power on the question of "what are we going to do tonight", because you can present the later arrivals with a fait accompli - an already prepped and logistically defined adventuring scenario that's just getting to the good stuff. It is also useful for having time to do maintenance and solo adventuring, if your characters have outlying concerns that are appropriate to be dealt with outside the context of an organized adventuring party. These are, of course, things that can also be addressed several days in advance of a session, like we did with Debby's cake-baking exercise a few days back. Just get on the channel and see if you can find appropriate co-plotters to verify your prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430790/#Comment_430790" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T06:02:38+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  6:02AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damned piggy children!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430799/#Comment_430799" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T08:43:26+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  8:43AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game today at 6 GMT, I *think.* That's in an hour or so.<br/><br/>Also, if your character happens to be at the Hidden Trollop, be sure to ask the GM about the hunt for hidden magical cake.

As far as I'm concerned, feel free to do whatever with it. It is even possible to consider an alternate Carrion, used when you're GMing and not me. Would make sense with the amount of definition that the place has gained over a few sessions of urban adventuring - not to speak of my specific sources, which aren't the same specific sources (and specific interpretation of those sources) that somebody else would bring to it.<br/><br/>(To be specific, here's how I would prefer handling overlapping GM territories in a campaign like this, concerning shared fictional properties: the other GM reinterprets freely, the players accept that it's an alternate take on the same topic, and the GMs share notes however much they'd wish, so as to reflect events in the alternate locations to whatever degree they find amusing. So if PCs burn down the "Temple of the Spider God" in Mike's Carrion, perhaps in my Carrion it's the Old Temple that's been burned down - stuff like that. Similarly, if I ended up GMing the Seafort for some reason, I'd just throw down my own interpretation on the matter, and Mike could reincorporate whatever events to whatever degree he wanted into his version.)<br/><br/>(Also, I would totally love to see an alternate take on the "city of pulp fantasy adventure" that Carrion represents. I'm sure that your Carrion would be amusingly different in detail.)<br/><br/>As for starting in the middle of scenarios, I don't have theoretical criticism of the practice, if that is considered more satisfactory. (I generally don't - as you've seen, I find the vortex of scenario negotiation leading to the flashpoint a central part of the game.) I would advice hearing the GM's scenario setup first and then choosing the characters for it, as it would be illegitimate to put an appreciated character in extreme danger without direct player input. As long as the player can go in with a new character with no investment in staying alive, it doesn't matter how desperate the GM's scenario might be.<br/><br/>I might or might not come in around 10pm GMT on Thursday night, as has occurred before. I hope that I won't, as that'd mean that my writing is going well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430964/#Comment_430964" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-14T13:03:10+00:00" title="April 14, 2014  1:03PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2014 1:27PM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>(Also, I would totally love to see an alternate take on the "city of pulp fantasy adventure" that Carrion represents.

I appreciate the fact that the players don't quite know how serious the situation is when prepping (because you only roll the difficulties after character choice and equipping), and I also very much like the strategic point you make: it's a way to establish an amenable ship in the strategic milieu, so there are internal campaign stakes to it.<br/><br/>Three points I'd fine-tune:<br/><br/>1) You should make the players roll for positions on the crew (or otherwise determine them), too, and randomize the NPC crew dispositions. This way you might get to play the captain, or not, and you might have to deal with a mutiny (from either side of the fence), or not. This has huge significance for the final disposition of that ship if it survives to port, whether it'll end under PC ownership free and clear, in some sort of crew-ownership, or under a NPC owner-captain, or possessed by the PCs in contradiction to law (making them pirates), or whatever.<br/><br/>2) The ship should start (the disaster should strike) like 3d6 days away from safe terrain, rather than just three days. Makes it more challenging, an opportunity to e.g. perish for lack of potable water or whatever.<br/><br/>3) A 1,000 xp quest reward for the party if the ship makes it, and 10,000 if the party ends up in possession of the ship at the end of the travail. One could dress this up in monetary terms (a 1,000 gp reward for saving the ship from the merchant whose ship it is, whatever) of course, but that's ultimately irrelevant to me - the point is to be clear about the goals of the scenario.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, though, a fine One Page Dungeon subject matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430970/#Comment_430970" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-14T13:38:56+00:00" title="April 14, 2014  1:38PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2014 1:42PM by adamwb.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds awesome.

Ships of various kinds are usually 5000\u201330000 coins.

But I'd imagine having a public place to deposit game resources (other than Google drive) would probably make spectating a little easier for regular forum-goers. Like, someone just curious about how we're mapping - etc. <br/><br/>An elegant solution to the Multi-DM Paradox is for DMs to jot down little tables (or just single Encounter entries) for different things they introduce in a certain region. Then, when the next Playgroup comes along, they can simply open up the previous group's tables for, say, Carrion and effectively have all the same colour without the original Master being present. Write-as-you-go-Module Making, so to speak. <br/><br/>Is anyone else seriously contemplating being a DM for us? Gimme a whisper or something and we can go through some options: I'd like it so that whoever is online of an evening, some kind of small playing-card scenario can be dug out and enjoyed. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431084/#Comment_431084" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-16T05:11:04+00:00" title="April 16, 2014  5:11AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm playing a game on Google Docs and G+ in which we collaboratively build a map and a few documents about locations on the map with pictures, written descriptions and encounter tables.

Might try set aside some time on IRC post/pre game to make the playgroup populate various lists; the flow of information is so fast that it's pretty easy to see what's a natural thought and what's a deliberate joke - we narrowly avoided having Vonnegut's <i>Ice-9</i>* in the hold. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>(*Speaking of which, where's my Wes Anderson adaption of <i>Cat's Cradle </i>starring Jason Schwartzman and Peter Dinklage?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431194/#Comment_431194" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-17T10:59:43+00:00" title="April 17, 2014 10:59AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We are getting ready to sea hexcrawl now.

A threatening storm front was two days away. Laden with our cargo of drugs, whale ambergris and a visiting wizard sultan (with harem and royal guards) we set sail to find a safe course to land.<br/><br/>The master of the ship was Lefory Acquaid (ChristopherWeeks) who was bumbling and very rich. Next was our good captain, who was either an NPC cleric called Aved, or Eero playing a TALKING WHALE. Salty Ben (MartinEden) was a lieutenant and we had two PC clerks: Benbet Pegason (DWeird) who had escaped the law in Carrion and Ameqran Shaw (Jonas) (a new player - whoo!).<br/><br/>We sailed NE past a mysterious light-house way out in the middle of the ocean, but decided not to risk investigating. Then, on the second day, crew morale was poor in the face of the storm, so Benbet attempted to cheer the crew by telling them the Story of 1,000 Needless Sailor deaths (a poor Cha roll there). So we broke out the booze and hoped they wouldn't discover the cargo was almost entirely hallucinogens.<br/><br/>As the evening drew in, a giant mechanical fish-submarine thing appeared and began tailing us at a distance of a 100 feet. We were debating what to do with it when I had to leave for the evening. I see from the Google Doc that Paul started playing after that, as Kip the ship's boy, and that Lefory died and Chris took over playing Pered, the crack-shot crewman with the mangy parrot.

From my perspective, the two defining moments were when Lefory died by being crushed by the ship's mast when the giant Roc attacked, and so the ship's cargo experienced an interesting legal reset; and then the exploding gold where we all almost died. The only other co-owner of the cargo was the sultan, so Benbet approached the captain about maybe tossing the fellow overboard. The captain was a religious man, so he didn't want to take part in the deed himself... But nor was he going to protest too much if the sultan 'happened' to die. So Benbet (who, I should correct you, didn't escape the law, but rather probable thieve's guild retaliation after some very unsuccessful spying) recruited Kip the Ship's boy to help possibly drug, poison or otherwise murder the sultan and his harem.<br/><br/>On the same island that Benbet finally found a source of ingestable poison, a small hunting/water party lead by Peret found a pool that turns anything it touches to water. Naturally enough, they brought it back to the ship and tried out various items on it, all of which successfully turned to gold. However, when they tried to turn water into gold, it turned into superheated liquid gold... Which promptly exploded, splattering everyone in the room, turning one of Peret's eyes to gold and killing two sailors, with one of them being the much beloved cook. This had every crewmember frenzied, splashing each other with the golden waters, killing, maiming, and ripping the gold bits away.<br/><br/>Benbet tried to restore some order with a rousing speech, but it was only so-so succesful. Peret, meanwhile, just wanted to leave the quarreling members of the crew on the island and have them deal with shit there. In the end, the ship just sailed around the island once or twice, letting the gold-hungry crazies cool down a bit, and then picked them back up.<br/><br/>As it stands, Benbet is poised to poison the sultan and his family, but the ship itself is in somewhat uncertain shape, what with it's crew having just gone through a bout of gold-craze.<br/><br/><br/>It was a weird experience, in ways. I felt very much like I had a character from another genre, trying to murder sultans in their sleep while the ship was flutting from island to island and finding increasingly weird magical stuff there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431219/#Comment_431219" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-18T03:45:16+00:00" title="April 18, 2014  3:45AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You forgot about the whispy floating lights you caught by the barrell, the two pieces of a brass scarab figurine you found on the beach and the crew sighting a silervy craft flying above the clouds before the storm.  Adventurous situations abound, but you've behaved sensibly throughout. Encouraging murder plots in the Private Messaging and diciding to roll to see if the crew would go gold-crazy is punishing you for your prudence. ;p A boat is, above all, a social adventure. Be duely warned: some encounters shift the crew's mood dramatically. <br/><br/>I'll be very happy to talk about how the game went on this side of the screen. I found the whole business very relaxing actually and look forward to arranging the second leg of our voyage (and maybe stock up on some new players?). I felt like we got much done and adventures were had. <br/><br/>I liked the characters everyone played. Human beings don't default to "pirate" as soon as they get near salt water - so I'm glad we had an interesting array of personalities. Loved the craziness of new players joining and having to roll who they were on a pre-existing list of crew members (who said I had a thing for NPC prep!?), including the Impossibly rich 4th Level Magic-User Sultan and his wives! The social range we had in the party (from Master to Cabin Boy) got some good RP juices going. <br/><br/>I've already been asked to write up my tables neatly so the scenario can be run with a Real Live Group (how outrageously flattering!), would anyone else be interested?

How long you spent on various aspects, which were important to get right vs. which ones could be hand-waved safely later, and which parts were generated by the group (perhaps the cargo and the NPC list?) vs. carefully pre-defined by you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431312/#Comment_431312" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T07:33:29+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  7:33AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2014 7:35AM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The prep is really low intensity. Actually, my aim in the DM experience is to be as low intensity as possible: I want an easy life, and I certainly can't be the stimulationist/simulationist computer the OSR text/folklore suggests. Far too stressful. You might call my DM style lazy, but I like to think of it as flowing down the path of least resistance. My D&amp;D Tao?<br/><br/>The key to prepping this campaign was a nice tight focus on colour and exploration before anything else. This is a variant on Eero's Primordial D&amp;D that points to "Challengesome Adventure" as D&amp;D's aim. Challenge-Adventure/Colour-Exploration are very similar, perhaps synonymous in many contexts, but it seemed more important the the players experience a speedy procession of colourful locations and situations through eventful exploration than to set up a balanced expectation of a challenge-reward axis as found in the typical dungeon adventure. <br/><br/>A ship at sea seemed like apt situation to drive this style of game: the transport-cum-habitation confines all known PCs and NPCs into a shared space with easily recognised and performed relationships and goals - the status-game between the Officers and the Crew is pretty intuitive to everyone. Simply place 'em in a boat out at sea, tell the players that Home and Safe is X/Y days that-a-way and they have a problem to solve (a nearby storm/pirate ship/real danger). The storm isn't necessary but it gets people thinking and sets a good pro-active mood. <br/><br/>Player pro-activity is key to my D&amp;D Tao/Zen/tranquillity flow thing. The players own the boat (effectively), so moving it is their business. All reasonable boating stuff is on the boat - rope, cloth, knives, hooks, poles, compasses, a spy-glass, whatever, but it might not be in easy reach in every situation - so describing how you're getting the ship to go faster and commanding the crew in certain ways all effects how I make the world respond to the player (the boat goes faster, the crew fight off a giant squid well) but really it comes down to the players picking up the ship-piece and moving it to the next hex as fast as they like and making me take an Event Roll. <br/><br/>Event Rolls are my main activity as a DM. The reason I've gone through my total process above is so I don't look dumb when I tell you that rolling a single d6 is pretty much what I spend my time doing as a DM behind the screen. Players enter a hex (at their speed of travel it was 1 hex every 12 hours, so events at dawn and dusk, or noon or midnight) and I roll for an event. 1 or 2 is a Sea Encounter and 6 is an Island. A usual Wandering Monster check might only be on a 1 but as my Encounters are focused on Colour and Exploration I wanted to have more of them come up! <br/><br/>The Sea Encounter chart is a 30-item list that started life as a d4 table on a piece of scrap paper at work. Starting small and building towards a 1000-piece Megatable as inspiration strikes is the most sane approach. Again, emphasis on Colour rather than Challenge, so there are very few entries (maybe 20%) that are Challenges in the D&amp;D sense of the word (i.e. Potentially Deadly). This might seem like I'm playing with kid-gloves but I'm 100% convinced that player interaction with the world is fundamentally entropic (everything a real human mind examines in D&amp;D world turns into the senseless, chaotic mush-of-the-imagination) and thus chaos and conflict will abound naturally and I really don't need to set up purposefully antagonistic threats. So really the name of the game is populating this table with little events that seem suitable to the genre of High Fantasy At Sea. Lots of texts to draw from - <i>Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Pirates of Blackwater, Nintendo's Wind Waker, Monkey Island, Earthsea, 20,000 Leagues, Moomins, Prince Valiant,</i> etc. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://d1466nnw0ex81e.cloudfront.net/n_iv/600/1014015.jpg"/><br/><br/>We go from being attacked by the Kraken all the way to light showers of silvery dust from a solitary black cloud that has no effect other than to make the sea teem with fish. In the last game we literally met Captain Nemo in the Nautilus. Now this could have been a fight but it seems more colourful to relax the usual D&amp;D combativeness and write that Nemo's only hostile if you're carrying slaves, but otherwise points you towards land in a friendly "get outta my sea, damn kids" kinda way. In fact I'll usually roll a second d6 after establishing the encounter to roughly determine an NPC's positive or negative reaction to meeting the players. Nemo rolled high, so he was very friendly and pointed out two islands nearby (one with Giant Ants, which the players cleverly avoided). Again, with this theory of D&amp;D Entropy, I might as well start everyday human NPCs as reasonably disposed to the players as new acquaintances - if their situations put them at even the slightest of odds (Nemo classically hates Slavers, the PCs have a boat fulla slaves - which *is* a cargo option, of course. Good design there) then we're going to have fighting and chaos. Why force the challenge? <br/><br/>The post-Encounter d6 reaction/disposition roll is really useful in giving me pointers to how a less obvious scene might play out. The Roc Encounter is actually on my table without much info, but during play my disposition roll was so poor I felt the Roc should menace the ship, inflict some structural damage and maybe pluck up a random crewman for dinner. You know, colourful menace rather than strict combat challenge. If the PCs had wanted to chase down the Roc over the sea and burn its nest, then it totally could have become one - but for now I'm keeping it easy and trusting to Entropy to drive things into conflict. <br/><br/>The Island table is only eight entries. Islands differ from sea encounters in the way that trap-rooms differ from wandering monsters - the threat/adventure is still there, just much more tied to a High Colour location that can be reliably retuned to once it's On The Map. The principal is easy - imagine something Weird/Compelling/Supernatural that you could find on an isolated island in Fantasyland/Mythological Greece/Nintendo's <i>Wind Waker</i> (yes, it's very Video Gamey, isn't it? I like that. High Whimsy levels, high supernatural themes). The pool of water than turns what it touches to gold is lifted straight from <i>Dawn Treader </i>, with a few additionally sadistic twists added by yours truly. But there's really not much to the islands aside from a High Colour mood I want to push: the perfect hush of the dusky Yew-covered Islet with this still, cursed pool of water. That sudden roar from the crew when they're told about the Magic! Ah! Thematic stuff! This is My Jam. <br/><br/>Anyway, hope this is insightful. Probably a little rangy but maybe we can neaten it up with some questioning. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431316/#Comment_431316" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T08:18:27+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  8:18AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Care to post the tables?

I really like your restatement of "D&amp;D entropy", which is a very tangible thing. Very old-school but very real, and a good principle to keep in mind in play. (I say "very old-school" because it's fundamentally opposed to the opposing school of thought, as seen in games following Sorcerer, where the fiction is crafted very intentionally to produce and heighten conflicts.)<br/><br/>What about the hexploration aspect? Did you have a means of generating ship direction, weather, or "terrain", or were you just improvising that stuff? Was there a mechanism or principle around which the "journey home" operated? (For example, given a certain series of rolls, would it have been possible to make it back to port uneventfully?)<br/><br/>I'd love to play again, and my schedule's not too bad in general, but Wednesday is not an option for me. I'm willing to do the Hangouts thing, too - I've tried it before, and it works pretty well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431345/#Comment_431345" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T16:03:07+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  4:03PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah! I can do Wednesday or whatever evening is deemed best. My after-work schedule is pretty free for pushing around. Although pushing back drawing, painting and writing is a bad and procrastinatory habit I generally find our games creatively energising - so I'm keen for more. Tempted to write up a mini-Reconception of B/X D&amp;D as a game of Seafearing Fantasy for Players Aged 10 and Up... <i>Oceans &amp; Odysseys</i>, <i>Waves &amp; Wizards</i> (<i>Seas &amp; Sorcerers</i>!?)  or whatever. Probably help me run more of these adventures as well as keep quiet the steady, highly flattering stream of requests I'm getting to share as-of-yet-non-existent material. <br/><br/>Thanks Paul! Gratifying to know my ramblings about entropy inherent in the shared imaginative space and elsewhere are being received with anything other than derision. I admit it's a bit "out there" even by game theory standards. I like your placement of the idea in a timeline with Ron Edwards marking a pivotal shift towards a different philosophy. That said, it does separate RPGs into a BC/AD model with RE as a messianic figure... a scary thought! (Ah, but I tease: I know that wasn't your intention.)<br/><br/>Ok, sea hexploraton (or sexploration, if you like being deliberately misleading). The direction of the ship was pretty obvious to everyone as the only coast known to me is Greysands. So starting x days off the coast of Greysands with the goal of returning sets up the position and direction pretty easily. This information is pretty up-front in my write-up above; it's the premise of the scenario. I guess there's a strong motivating ideology of Home and Safe going on here; the players have much to loose but little to gain. Many of the encounters might suggest treasure is up for grabs (the Golden Pool, for example) but really the Players are exceptionally rich already, they just have to get back to port/civilisation to validate their wealth as a till-clerk might validate parking. This is a protraction of the D&amp;D notion that XP only comes from <i>spending</i> money, rather than earning it. I've always liked this thought and stuffing the players pockets with imaginative (/compelling/problematic) riches and letting their natural instincts to fight their way Home and Safe is a pretty good soft "kicker." <br/><br/>The storm/danger tends to set the weather for the initial stages of this adventure (there's a 4/6 chance of having the storm hit) - otherwise, I must confess, it's pretty improvised. Whether it's raining or sunny, whether the sunset is beautiful or the storm brings hail is actually not terribly important. It looks like it might be, being so important to the colour of seafearing, but it's really down to a certain poetic whimsy and what the mood of the encounters are suggesting. Importantly, <i>major</i> whether activities that <i>will</i> have an effect on the progress of the ship (becalment, sudden drastic wind change and further storm-fronts) are included in the Sea Encounters table, which demonstrates their systemic importance to me somewhat. So it's a real mix of colour-improv and the categorised demands of an OSR table here. <br/><br/>I guess the players could make it home without event? I mean, it's a 50% chance of meeting something in each hex so the odds are pretty miraculous, but it's possible I guess. Why that would be desirable, I couldn't tell you. If you're asking if this is balanced, fair and the players are likely to make it back if they're reasonable... well, I couldn't tell you that either. "No" would be my guess. The constriction of the game thus far to low levelled characters can't even guarantee that antagonising captain Nemo won't result in the boat getting sunk and everyone drowning shortly after. You probably wouldn't get far if you wanted to come out here and pick fights, but that's D&amp;D everywhere.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431347/#Comment_431347" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T16:20:51+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  4:20PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2014 4:23PM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A note on D&amp;D Entropy: <br/>The classical opening situation of any game - the Tavern - is a great example of the tendency towards Chaos in D&amp;D. My hypothesis is that any normal playgroup that's started in a modestly detailed but pretty everyday Tavern environment will, without any directed adventurous input from the DM, eventually result in conflict. This is mostly because it's difficult to express yourself with any validity in D&amp;D without conflict, and therfore desire for expression is an entropic force in D&amp;D.<br/><br/> I wanna run a game where all I say is "You start in a tavern, here's a print out of a floorplan, a few NPCs and the Menu. Go." and then "What do you do?" every time it's my turn to talk and just watch as people are robbed blind, murdered and then set of fire - not necessarily in that order.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431384/#Comment_431384" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-21T04:18:08+00:00" title="April 21, 2014  4:18AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have unprecedented freedom to play tomorrow (Tuesday) if anyone else is up for it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431398/#Comment_431398" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-21T10:20:18+00:00" title="April 21, 2014 10:20AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm technically free on evenings both tuesday (if it's late enough) and wednesday, but I don't want to make any promises as it conflicts with getting sleep and spending time with my family.

If we get enough players, a GM, and if the Silent Dusk is still sailing, I'd be happy to continue that game. Or roll up a new character for another adventure.<br/><br/>Last time was the first time I played D&amp;D and the first time I played on IRC, so I can add some information for other prospective new players. I checked in as a spectator on an earlier game run by Eero, which is something I suggest doing if you're uncertain about joining. That time the game was already running, and since I needed help creating a character I didn't want to interrupt. The second time the game hadn't started, so with the help of the other players in the main chat, and a PM chat, I quickly rolled up my first character.<br/><br/>I got the name from the first suggestion on <a href="http://www.behindthename.com/random/" rel="nofollow">Behind the Name Random Name Generator</a>: Ameqran Shaw. By typing 6#1d6 in the main chat, the dice bot gave Ameqran:<br/><br/>Str: 10<br/>Dex: 17<br/>Con: 7<br/>Int: 11<br/>Wis: 7<br/>Cha: 11<br/><br/>Based on his high dexterity the other players suggested either a thief, an elf, or a halfling. I asked for the easiest one to play, and was suggested either a thief or a halfling, so I picked the latter. We're using the Moldvay rules, right? In that case I should add to the character sheet (in Google Drive) that he has a bonus with missile weapons and for hiding, and so on.<br/><br/>I realize now that I shouldn't have been allowed to play a halfling, since the requirement is a minimum of 9 in both dexterity and constitution. Are we disregarding minimum requirements on purpose? I'd like to use the rules as written, to get to know the actual game! I'd like to keep playing Ameqran, but follow the rules when creating the next character. I'd like to change his alignment from neutral to lawful, as that's how I played him. I hadn't read the Moldvay text on alignment when I picked neutral, and lawful fits him a lot better.<br/><br/>How do we handle the percentage bonuses to XP? Ameqran would get a 5 % bonus based on his dexterity. I've seen that some groups add 5 % of the next level immediately to avoid having to add 5 % every time you gain XP, so that would be 2000 * 0.05 = 100 XP for a 1st level halfling. Or is it such a minuscule amount, combined with low chances of survival, that you don't bother?<br/><br/>The game text in the Google doc says:<br/><br/>"A 1,000 xp quest reward for the party if the ship makes it, and 10,000 if the party ends up in possession of the ship upon reaching safe port. Additional XP may be gained from the sale of any cargo (10% of GP value is taxed in Carrion)."<br/><br/>I have a couple of questions:<br/><br/>1. Do we still get monster XP (is there such a thing in Moldvay?) and gold XP, in addition to the above?<br/><br/>2. Is the 1000 XP quest reward divided among the PCs, or does each PC get 1000 XP? If it's divided, is it among the PCs who are in play when reaching port, or between every PC who has been in play for at least a session?<br/><br/>Last time I could only join for 60 minutes, which turned into 90 minutes because time flies. I didn't get to roll dice, but it was fun to act a bit and to see the ship and its inhabitants turn into life. The players were free to run the ship as they liked, both in the sense of deciding where to go and also, for example, if the ship's clerks (Ameqran was one of two clerks, based on a roll on the character rank table) counted as officers or not (they did).<br/><br/>We had a caller that was responsible for communicating our intended ship movement, and from my perspective it was nice to not have to bother with that for my first game. I imagine that without a caller the GM would spend a lot of time trying to figure out who of the players have authority to decide the movement, if there's consensus, and so on. Now the consensus building, or dictatorial decision making, lies with the caller, so the GM has one less thing to do and can focus on more important things.<br/><br/>The ship's log in the Google Drive document only lists day 1 and 2, with the second day being the meeting with the giant iron fish. It would be nice if one of the players who kept on playing could add the following days, so that we who missed them can catch up.<br/><br/>I've been looking forward to next session since the last one, so I hope it's Tuesday <del>or Wednesday</del>. It was great fun.<br/><br/><i>Edit</i>: Wednesday's out. /Jonas                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431407/#Comment_431407" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-21T14:56:30+00:00" title="April 21, 2014  2:56PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I realize now that I shouldn't have been allowed to play a halfling, since the requirement is a minimum of 9 in both dexterity and constitution.

No relying on a rulebook over rulings, no going with some arbitrary idea just because it's in some rulebook, and so on. I have zero respect for a procedure that e.g. causes a player to not play a halfling because Moldvay says that it has stat minima, while the players at the table do not see such a difficulty or even remember that rule. Where is the legitimacy to a rule that nobody agrees with or understands?<br/><br/>Of course that's just my viewpoint, I'm sure there are others who admire Moldvay specifically and would like to be more book-consistent. Hasn't come up so far, so it's a good topic of discussion.<br/><br/>Regarding your questions: you can add the percentage xp bonus to xp from the start. No big deal if you don't care to, either - as you say, it generally does not matter.<br/><br/>For Silent Dusk and its xp rewards, Mike's the authority, as he's GMing the adventure. I would assume that monster and treasure xp are normal, and the quest xp is divided among the group in even shares. XP is generally distributed between the characters who are in on the session when the xp gain occurs, with shares perhaps set aside for others if the players feel that those other characters contributed significantly to the success in some prior session.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431409/#Comment_431409" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-21T17:13:38+00:00" title="April 21, 2014  5:13PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The min-stat thing was something I was thinking about when you were rolling up but I didn't bring it up because, primarily, I didn't want to be that guy.

For me it's most beneficial to read, play, read about things encountered in play, make adjustments, and play again. This is a chance for me to experience the rules and not just read them.<br/><br/>To quote Wittgenstein in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus:\n<blockquote>My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them\u2014as steps\u2014to climb beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)<br/>He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.</blockquote>\nI've barely started climbing, so for me it's too early to throw away the ladder that the rules provide. Or, to use another quote; Chesterton's fence:\n<blockquote>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, \u201cI don\u2019t see the use of this; let us clear it away.\u201d To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: \u201cIf you don\u2019t see the use of it, I certainly won\u2019t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."</blockquote>\nJohn F. Kennedy supposedly paraphrased this as "Don\u2019t ever take a fence down until you know the reason why it was put up". The rule on minimum requirements is there for a reason. My guess is that it is to guarantee that demi-humans fill a certain niche. You don't expect a dexterity 3 elf based on Tolkien's work, and the minimum requirement makes sure you don't see it here either. It also makes demi-human adventurers more rare than humans, which may be good if the setting is focused on humans. On a player level I can see how it makes demi-humans more sought after for players if they are harder to get.<br/><br/>I agree that the group's rulings should trump the rules, but I see the rules as "first rulings" that someone else has made for you. They set a precedence, but you can of course change them if they don't provide the effect that the group is after.<br/><br/>I have no problem playing Greysands/Sea Exploration fast and loose. It will still give me fodder for the "read about things encountered in play" step, for example minimum requirements, which is great. We shouldn't stop play to look up rules and the GM shouldn't feel any pressure to play by the book. I guess we will stop play if the GM makes a ruling that the players doesn't understand or agree with, for example giving +1 in one situation, but not in a later similar situation. Referring to a Moldvay rule may solve these situations quickly, but only if the whole group agree with the rule.<br/><br/>When I GM Whitehack I write down my rulings if I expect them to appear in play again, for them to set a clearer precedence. These codified rulings have a higher status than the actual rules, while an in-the-moment ruling has a lower status than the rules until I've had time to think it through and codify it. I usually start each session with an update on rulings I've thought about since last session, to build group consensus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431485/#Comment_431485" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-22T21:43:53+00:00" title="April 22, 2014  9:43PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a solid post, Jonas.<br/><br/>I'm reading through Moldvay at the moment myself, for what it's worth. There's an account of someone else reading through the text <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?333865-Let-s-Read-Dungeons-amp-Dragons-Basic-Rules-by-Tom-Moldvay" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.<br/><br/>As for the minimum requirements for demi-humans, I've seen Gary Gygax explain that it is to make sure that demi-human characters are suitably rare.<br/><br/>It makes a lot of sense from this perspective: your reward for rolling an unusually good set of stats is that you have the option to play this unusual character type, including some special abilities you get right away. To make it a choice which remains interesting, however, we'll slow down the XP progression and put a cap on the level you can achieve. So, rolling those great stats gives you this tempting option, but with a downside to keep it an interesting choice.<br/><br/>(In our particular case, I wouldn't have objected to the halfling character, however: the idea that rolling unusually well gives you this opportunity, I think, isn't broken here. Sure, we're not following the letter of the law - that 9 Constitution - but we ARE following the spirit of the law, and I'd say that rolling a 17 Dexterity is plenty of justification for making a halfling character. Had you rolled a totally mundane set of stats which didn't meet the minimums and then asked to be a halfling, I might have had a different opinion.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431488/#Comment_431488" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-23T02:25:51+00:00" title="April 23, 2014  2:25AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Paul. Nice to see the Gygax explanation.<br/><br/>I went back and looked at the section <i>Ability Score Adjustments</i> in Moldvay, where you can move points between certain abilities 2 for 1. But you can never raise or lower Constitution or Charisma, so it wouldn't have helped me with the Constitution requirement. Does anyone have an idea why those two are exempt? Is it because they are so central for HP and the number of retainers, that the temptation to increase them would be too high?<br/><br/>Also, another (paraphrased) Chesterton quote, for fun:\n<blockquote>The whole modern [OSR] world has divided itself into <del>Conservatives</del> Rules and <del>Progressives</del> Rulings. The business of <del>Progressives</del> Rulings is to go on making mistakes.

The GM was Potemkin, with DWeird, ChristopherWeeks, and me as players.<br/><br/>The action continued on the island with a pool of water that turned everything it touched into gold. There was a discussion among the PCs what to do about the crew that had left their posts on the ship to use the gold water. One PC wanted to leave them, and two wanted to pick them up. We rolled 50% for the captain and the rest of the crew, with the result that the PC who wanted to leave people stepped down after a small attempted mutiny. There was also a discussion on whether the gold water would be communal or if each PC and crew member immediately would get private shares.<br/><br/>We continued our journey and found a small ancient boat drifting at sea with eight skeletons by the oars. We decided to tip the boat over and bury them at sea to remove the bad omen, but at first contact they turned to life. The skeletons tried to pull the crew members with hooks down, but all of the crew made it while two skeletons fell in. The NPC captain saved the day, by being a cleric and rolling exactly six skeletons turned.<br/><br/>After continuing the NPC sultan passenger managed to magically locate a pirate ship between us and our destination. Through magic the pirate ship also became aware of us. The ships were equally fast, so we couldn't really go pass them without them catching us. We raised a white flag and let them come closer. The plan was for the sultan to use his charm spell on the pirate captain, with the backup plan being to fire gold water on their sails or hull with the ship's ballista. The pirate ship fired first, but missed. When the sultan tried to charm the pirate captain the DM rolled a d12 instead of a d20 by mistake, which succeeded. When a player pointed this out, the player mistakenly rolled another d12, which also succeeded. At last we rolled a d20, and a third success! When the pirate captain issued orders to leave us be the crew mutinied, but the pirate captain made his command roll and we could escape.<br/><br/>We had a final encounter when an enormous amount of fish appeared. The Silent Dusk is still a couple of days away from the destination Carrion.<br/><br/>Some observations:<br/><br/>* I missed the end of the previous session, so I wasn't that invested in the gold water. It was a very neat idea and a fun encounter, but I didn't think that the time we spent on hiding a personal flask or publicly taking a personal flask was very fun. I was a bit quiet during this part, and it was very nice of another player to check in by PM to see if I was having fun. Going silent is a bad thing to do when you're chatting. If you're sitting around a table the other people can tell when you fold your arms and lean back and wait, but not here, so it's important to always communicate. It wasn't that I was bored or considered leaving, it was just that I felt I had nothing to add and wanted to wait until the others were done.<br/><br/>* The skeleton encounter was really good. I liked how it started out with vague hints, like a small light on the horizon, and the sultan saying he could sense great pain and suffering from the boat. The players were expecting a ghost ship or a slave ship, but when we found the boat I didn't expect the skeletons to wake up. The final fish encounter was the opposite of this, which is why I think it fell a bit flat. It's a nice encounter and should be kept in the table, but it would have benefited from a gradual buildup, like the sea around the ship starting to boil without mentioning fish, to give the players some time to figure out what to do. But we wanted to wrap up, so it's understandable it was a bit quick.<br/><br/>* I joked about being saved by the two NPCs, first the skeletons and then the pirates. But the plan to use their abilities was still the players', so it didn't feel like the GM saved our bacon. Both NPCs meant that we could avoid fighting, so it would have been a different game if they hadn't been there. So far my halfling has readied his short bow three times (iron fish, skeletons, pirates), but hasn't fired a single arrow. It's just an observation, and in all situations we wanted to avoid fighting if we could since it would've been very dangerous.<br/><br/>* We had two channels, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23habavaara&amp;Mode=like">#habavaara</a> for OOC talk and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23silentdusk&amp;Mode=like">#silentdusk</a> for IC talk. I think it's a good idea, but unfortunately we couldn't roll dice in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23silentdusk&amp;Mode=like">#silentdusk</a>, so we had to use both channels for playing. This lead to split attention, and both me and the GM had trouble keeping up in both channels and knowing what to post where. I think that *all* game talk should go into <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23silentdusk&amp;Mode=like">#silentdusk</a>, even jokes and player strategizing, because that's what would happen around a table. It's easy to mark dialog with quotes and short comments in parenthesis even in the game channel, so there's no need to use the OOC channel for game talk. The OOC channel could be used for "I'm having this great pasta right now" kind of comments, and for other people who are curious, but don't want to disturb the game channel with questions. When I first joined <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23habavaara&amp;Mode=like">#habavaara</a> and there was a game going on I didn't want to start asking questions, so a separate game channel can be a good idea.<br/><br/>* There was talk at the end of doing a Google Hangouts video chat next time. My current online gaming situation won't allow that, but please go ahead anyway. I'm playing on the couch in a silent apartment with my kids sleeping. I don't want to talk to myself and wake them and I don't want to put on earphones because then I won't know if they wake up. IRC has been perfect for me. Also, I'm using green text on a black background in my IRC client, so it feels like playing a text adventure game, with a much more intelligent game engine (thanks, Mike!).

I appreciate that some might be nervous about verbal/visual communication given that English is a second language or whathaveyou, but I'm willing to experiment. Even if I'm the only person speaking into a mic and the rest of you type your responses and questions in IRC it would speed up play greatly and ease much pressure on these Lazy DM shoulders. That said, I love faces, voices and the unwritten performative/ritual aspect of D&amp;D: so seeing you all around the virtual table would be great! <br/><br/>All told, I feel that this session wasn't quite as punchy as the last one. I'll go into this later, but there are some encounters that would have been worth pushing. The pirate attack was tense, but ultimately lacking real character. Low on detail. The fish were really skimmed over due to exhaustion on my part and what could be a good moment of tension and surprise became a very bland occurrence. You know you're fucking up running Sea Fantasy when you have to clearly explain that, yes, this amount of fish in the sea is supernatural - the context and foreshadowing of the encounter should denote its mystical quality: sudden changes in weather, crew mood and other subtle signifiers of a sudden shift away from reality. A transgression of the day-to-day medievalism of the setting. <br/><br/>Any questions?

I could say stuff about where I start building something like that, and where I stop (to leave the rest for play), but that might not be so useful.<br/><br/>Regarding audiovisual equipment, I would be surprised if AV quality of all things became an issue. I'd rather expect somebody's Internet connection to give up, as I have difficulty imagining the microphone that were theoretically functional but nevertheless so crappy that it couldn't be used for this.

Perhaps we'll see that soon.<br/><br/>Last night we didn't get a Hangout, as there weren't enough Hangout-enabled players.

It would be a foolish claim to make, considering how many do such things. Besides, if 3rd level characters broke the game, then it would make no sense to play them when the level is achieved legitimately. I just don't understand the character choice myself, as for me doing it as a player would be a complete repudiation of everything the game stands for. It'd be like asking to have an extra $100,000 in Monopoly at the start - I would never do it unless I wanted to show throat and play a practice game with a master, with a major handicap in my favour.<br/><br/>In case it should sound strange for me to say that I don't understand a choice while still maintaining that it is a valid choice to make, think of it in terms of constitutional rights: I'm not just doing rhetorical grandstanding when I say that I think that players have inalienable creative rights in D&amp;D (as opposed to the autocratic model where the GM is king), I genuinely do think that there are things that players can do even when I don't understand or appreciate those choices myself. The play that actually occurs is truly a cooperative endeavour, which means that sometimes you have things occur that would never happen if you were playing all the positions yourself.<br/><br/>My model of the game has it that play cannot occur unless a scenario is arrived at in full consensus, which is why players technically speaking have a strong negotiation position for playing whatever they want as their characters: if you want a 3rd level character and I don't want you to have that, then one of us necessarily has to give in or we can't play together at all. My current constitutional strategy is to not contest the issue as GM or co-player, partly because nobody has ever pushed that far on the matter.<br/><br/>(And as I said, this is an interesting situation for me, as it's new - I have no idea if my thinking on the matter might change in the future because of the experience, especially if other players feel the inclination to start with high-level characters as well. I could imagine myself deciding at some point in the future that I don't want to play or GM for a group that starts PCs above 1st level.

I'm available from 6 pm GMT and want to leave for bed at about 10 pm GMT, to catch at least 5-6 hours of sleep. I realize that may exclude me from the bulk of the session, but that's OK.<br/><br/>I'm sorry that you find GMing over IRC stressful, Mike. I guess playing is less stressful, as you don't have to respond to everyone and can watch the other players talk to the GM for while. Is that your experience with Eero as GM? For me IRC has turned out to be the opposite of stressful, almost meditative. It's not because I'm a fast typist, I'm not, but because I've embraced the slightly slower tempo than if we would sit around a table talking. I haven't experienced that you've been extra slow or anything, so I hope that you don't put any unnecessary stress on yourself. The GM is usually the choke point anyway, also at the table, so I've been interpreting any small delay as "the GM is thinking/planning" or "the GM is consulting his tables".<br/><br/>I'll check in to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23habavaara&amp;Mode=like">#habavaara</a> tonight to see if the game is on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431706/#Comment_431706" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T11:21:40+00:00" title="April 27, 2014 11:21AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2014 1:03PM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The magic school of fish has dragged the poor Silent Dusk two hexes away from Carrion directly into the hex where we last saw the pirates.

Around Carrion it's like Norway. Further up the coast (more east than north), towards Hyperborea, the climate is increasingly arctic - think upper Canada, near the Pole.<br/><br/>The landscape is magically unstabilized, though, so there are warmer areas. Xylarthen's Bay up near Hyperborea is warmer than the environs, for example, as is the Dunnsmouth river delta. Usually these differences aren't very notable, but far in-land they can be severe, particularly in the Wastes - there is apparently a "Yellow Forest" in the Wastes, a tropical jungle region severely aberrant compared to the general climate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431756/#Comment_431756" name="Item_179" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T11:50:20+00:00" title="April 28, 2014 11:50AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2014 1:10PM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So anything can be explained into the setting, got it!<br/><br/>I was wondering about what animals and people and stuff ought to be shoved into Opening the Dunn random tables.

It's a post-apocalyptic world, inconsistencies in culture are to be expected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431782/#Comment_431782" name="Item_183" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T16:35:10+00:00" title="April 28, 2014  4:35PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2014 4:41PM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been trying to be really undetailed in regards to the naval tech.

Which is, of course, a major motivation for liberally mixing various sources.

You should check out some American underground fantasy from the '50s to '70s sometime (or just read more 2000 AD) - having laser pistols (a rare, legend-tinged remain of a gentler age) being sold in a post-magiwar setting is entirely genre conventional. I don't feel at all lost in the Grey Sands setting, so far everything makes sense to me.<br/><br/>As for text-based creativity, it's the same as all creativity: you take risks, and some things work and some things don't. Wisdom is to have some sense of what does and what doesn't. I would not have chosen this source material for Carrion if I wasn't confident that I could work with it.

There's only the two of us, so an injury or death means either of these projects will suffer greatly and the other might very well simply die to exposure of lack of food.<br/><br/>We also get random wilderness encounters. The last one was a man (and an able fighter) stumbling out of the woods, claiming that his party was destroyed by a monstrous man with huge cat on a chain and a log for a weapon. My character set out to find the location of the attack, mostly because there may still have been supplies there, as well as to get a bead on this probable ogre's location.<br/><br/>So that's your typical adventure - treasure, monster, barely known location.<br/><br/>So a probable ogre was seen just a problem to be avoided. However, by the time my character had set out to track the stumbling survivor, it was getting dark already. At that point, I realized that spending a night in the woods during winter with no fire with me was more scary than an ogre with a pet cougar - you can avoid one but not the other - and had my character turn back.<br/><br/>So far the adventurous side is mostly tension-building. There are dangers out in the woods, unfriendly tribes and monsters. But the very fact that you need all of your effort just to stay alive out there and than your plan is to stay in the wilderness rather than just cross it means that these dangers feel like actual dangers to be avoided or dealt with, rather than adventures to undertake.<br/><br/>I quite like it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431927/#Comment_431927" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T09:02:54+00:00" title="May  1, 2014  9:02AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only a little unhappy I wasn't invited to the party because it sounds like a lot of fun! <br/><br/>I simply don't know why there isn't more Survivalist D&amp;D - especially considering the popularity of recent video games in the genre.

All of the current players (me, Eero, and the GM Christopher) simply have IRC running in the background, so when all of us are on at the same time, we simply do a pickup game.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to join the useful social practice of always being online, sort of, you can download and install an IRC client, such as mIRC: <a href="http://www.mirc.com/get.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirc.com/get.html</a> ; type /server open.ircnet.net in the white window that opens up, and type /j <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23habavaara&amp;Mode=like">#habavaara</a> to join. You can then minimize the program and chat at your leisure. Or you can just look up an IRC tutorial online, plenty of those.<br/><br/><br/>As for the XP scheme... It's a fairly traditional deal, with bolt-ons like the 100 xp/hectare of farmland. I believe the idea is that we'll go on adventures anyway, and either get their value as quests, or get raw cash to buy things with and get XP from that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431932/#Comment_431932" name="Item_198" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T11:59:11+00:00" title="May  1, 2014 11:59AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And more specifically, Mike, you entered the channel on Tuesday when we were gearing up, were offered a chance to play and instead talked about other stuff for two or three hours and then left.

The players were offered a number of possible hooks (apparently the ancient battlefield is a good place to scavenge and then sell ancient armour, for example), and finally followed the directions on a strange old map:<br/><br/>Supposedly, there is an ancient site of power, or storage house, or bunker, which was built by the war-wizards somewhere near this location for some no-longer-remembered strategic reasons. A handful of characters set out to look for it, bumped into some scavengers returning from the battlefield, and eventually found a hilltop marked with stone monoliths. A freshly deceased deer lies on the stone...<br/><br/>We will attempt to resume this adventure tomorrow - joiners-on welcome - at 1600 GMT. If quorum isn't reached, there's a chance we will reconvene at 2200 GMT for a second attempt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432054/#Comment_432054" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-03T15:22:50+00:00" title="May  3, 2014  3:22PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A potential game is on right now, if there are any interested parties...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432186/#Comment_432186" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-06T17:03:09+00:00" title="May  6, 2014  5:03PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had an interesting moment of weakness and hygienic epiphany today.  I was running Daumantas and Eero in the Newton theater and an encounter was generated by my table (the second time this encounter was rolled, and so there was history with these people) that got violent and dangerous.  I was trying to decide what my NPCs were going to do and I really didn't want to kill off the party so I was hemming and hawing a little and I started to look at the character-record spreadsheet to figure out how many HP the PCs had.  And I froze.  Of course, I don't even need to know that -- it's better if I don't!  And I just had them do their thing.  And it was close.  There was a point where we two sides revealed our HP and both PCs had one left and so did all three of the NPCs (one of whom had an 18 Con).  And the PCs won.  And it would have been a shitty win if I'd pulled my punches.  <br/><br/>Anyway this is probably all "duh" to you guys, but it was good for me.<br/><br/>It's not that I don't normally run dangerous games -- the last F2F game I ran was a Torchbearer that ended the fifth session with a TPK.  But there was something about stopping myself and taking the more purist approach of not even looking at data that was easy to (mis)use that spoke to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432187/#Comment_432187" name="Item_209" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-06T17:09:04+00:00" title="May  6, 2014  5:09PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2014 5:12PM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup!

Confession is good for the soul, though.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I basically just don't take a D&amp;D GM seriously before they've killed a few PCs. We can talk about it all we like, but until I see them do it, it's all insubstantial theory - maybe their characters have just been skilled and lucky, but also maybe the GM is misusing their wide influence to undermine the supposed dangers. (The D&amp;D GM has such a multitude of influences that it's almost impossible to get a legit game if the GM doesn't want one.) Not that I want my character to die when playing, it's just that I want a legit resolution even more. The only difference between a gauntlet by fire and a puppet theater is in whether there actually is a legitimate possibility of failure.<br/><br/>I personally gambled through that entire scene, basically because I decided that losing the mule was too much of a price to the poor, utterly poor Jacob - it is his only possession, its working output is basically the only thing keeping him out of the mines. For him it is worth going all prison gang on some woodspeople trying to steal it. I pre-empted Daumantas's diplomacy attempt because I believed that surprise and tactical momentum would be more valuable than the extremely slim chance that we might bully four desperate men with just the two of us (evidently no warrior braves, us) to make them leave us alone. What with my first-round fumble, we wouldn't have had a chance if they were more prepared for violence and actually, you know, did something during the first two rounds of combat <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432201/#Comment_432201" name="Item_214" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T03:19:11+00:00" title="May  7, 2014  3:19AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2014 3:20AM by Potemkin.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This would probably be a great time to open up some discussion about hygiene on the Silent Dusk. <br/><br/>Yes, a PC has died - but the circumstances weren't particularly enshrined in the kinds of procedure that legitimises in-game death.

I've already placed a bet on the Silent Dusk getting back home simply because you've got no balls to have them sink with all hands on board <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>If you don't like combat mechanically, don't use those rules. Instead, offer deals, for example. "Yeah, I see this giant bird situation as a minor danger for the ship as a whole, but a serious issue for some individuals. How about you all take 1d6 damage and then manage to drive it off?" That simple procedure does exactly what ordinary combat would, except much quicker. Very appropriate for a game process that focuses on strategic issues over tactical combat choreography.<br/><br/>Regarding the hygiene in determining whether things are dangers or tourist sights, my general advice is to train yourself out of the habit of teleological deduction and categories associated with it: don't frame decisions for yourself in terms of what will supposedly happen. As long as you're thinking of a sea serpent in terms of whether it's a combat encounter or not, you're not being hygienic. The only things you need to know are the in-fiction circumstances and such; those you either intuit, have in your notes, or roll randomly. Once you know that the sea serpent hates surface shipping, or is hungry, or is angry, you have something to work with in determining whether it might attack a ship. If you first decide that it's a color encounter, and then retroactively justify that by deciding that it's sated, then you're doing it wrong.<br/><br/>"Colour event", "tourist sighting", "combat encounter", "deadly" and so on are all terms of unhygienic teleological thinking: they're all about what you imagine might happen either immediately or later. You do not need to know the future, you merely need to know the past and the present. You need to be able to read "deadly" and think "it is widely considered deadly" instead of "it will kill the PCs if I let it". The latter is an evil and harmful thought, and the first step to fudging: once you have formed an opinion about the likely outcome, it is only a short additional step to "I do not want this to occur" and "I need to prevent this from happening".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432204/#Comment_432204" name="Item_216" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T05:06:11+00:00" title="May  7, 2014  5:06AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2014 5:06AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

I mean, I have the bloodlust - I've killed you twice - but you're probably on the money about whether the ship will make it home or not: the unhygienic nature of the scenario is there from the start with everything being stacked in the player's favour. I've not even made note of the ship's Hull Points (or whatever the bolt-on mechanic is called) or really considered the circumstances around its potential sinking. <br/><br/>Luckily, my players are very hygienic (who said it was the DM's responsibility alone?) and they've been reframing things to be meaningful challenges for the most part, acting in a reasoned way to stop the crew tearing each other apart (social relations *are* hygienic here, I'd argue, and probably more dangerous to boot!) and take precautions against stuff that is explicitly dangerous. Combat with the pirates, had it not been avoided, would have been hygienic (the avoidance was hygienic, and in fact wouldn't have happened in unhygienic play). The Golden Pool was also hygienic (but time consuming!). But the Roc was certainly iffy territory: I knew it was going to attack the ship (reaction roll) but what exactly "attack" meant here was very much left to me. Attack until killed or the ship is sunk? Attack the crew? Attack the ship itself? Urh, these vagaries are dirty, dirty, dirty but I'll be damned if I write out every possible permutation of action a creature can have into a table.

Anything to get your hands off the Roc's steering wheel, essentially. I would guess that Eero often uses 50/50 rolls in this kind of situation, too - combined with Chris's suggestion, this could be a nice mechanical approach: "the bird is hungry/the bird wants to drive the ship away" (50/50). It's not 100% hygienic, of course, since you're coming up with the outcomes in the first place, but establishing a motivation for the bird this way would allow you to make a decision about its behaviour (ok, the ship has changed course, so it leaves/ok, the Roc nabbed a crewmember, so now she will happily fly away with her meal).<br/><br/>My experience so far has been that I don't find lethality and character death to be a huge stumbling point (then again, I haven't killed a character yet, so that's still to be proven), but I do really suffer with "hygiene" when it comes to real-person-time issues. For instance, when I had the characters struggling to get past the stone slab and into what they expected to be a "dungeon", I found myself judging their attempts very much "in their favour", because I didn't want their attempts to come to nothing after an hour or more of poking around - it just seemed like a waste of the players' time. In the end, I let their plan work, conceptually, but committed to a double Strength check on the part of the warrior to see if they could carry out. I'm confident that, had the check failed, I would have left them there. However, deciding that their plan was workable at all was a slightly unhygienic moment, I feel. Perhaps next time in such a moment of hesitation I'll just roll a 50/50 or some similar procedure to help myself stay objective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432211/#Comment_432211" name="Item_222" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T06:57:24+00:00" title="May  7, 2014  6:57AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone is interested in exploring a suspected ancient Wizard War outpost by the edge of the epic site of the Battle of Thorgul-Hamun:<br/><br/>Today, GMT 1800!<br/><br/>Be ready...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432212/#Comment_432212" name="Item_223" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T07:15:43+00:00" title="May  7, 2014  7:15AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah! 1800!

The point I feel that was the most unhygienic was the falling debris - totally invented on the fly by me as "the probable outcome of a giant bird snapping off your crow's nest" - was effectively a second attack by the Roc that I awarded it (awarded myself?)outside of the "rules as agreed" that turned out to kill an exciting PC.

Paul there suggested that a 50/50 roll might not be hygienic because it's biased by the GM electing the outcomes to begin with, while Mike suggested that his choice of having the crow's nest fall on somebody was not hygienic because it was not by the rules. I disagree with both ideas.<br/><br/>Thing is, the GM is <i>supposed</i> to make choices and act as the conduit of the fiction. Of course Mike's treatment of the crow's nest was entirely legit - he says it himself, the reason for it was pure incidental inspiration brought about by imagining the situation. That's always a legit source of action! The same goes for condensing the infinity of possibilities into just a couple of options: the GM is supposed to be doing that as the conduit of the fictional world. There is no special virtue in the entirely imaginary goal of putting the entire setting into some engineer-built random table so you can have absolutely realistic random choices for situations.<br/><br/>Hygiene is about what you are trying to do yourself, and how your motivations, both conscious and subconscious, do to your procedures and choices. Mike's choice to have the Roc take it easy on the ship was suspect to me (don't know if unhygienic or intentionally wrong-headed) because I didn't sense him being open to the chance that the Roc might just destroy the entire ship; similarly Mike's choice to make the storm that the ship chose to escape by anchoring in a bay a color encounter felt suspect. However, the choice to have the Roc break the mast and have the parts injure somebody - <i>that</i> was pure play in my eyes.<br/><br/>(I'm commenting on this from outside the GM's head, and focusing on a single session that I happened to be observing from sort of outside it.)\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> I was poking at adapting Moldvay into a cross between Gamma World and Borderlands, and when I came up for breath, I realized almost all of the stat blocks for encounters would <i>ruin</i> a first-level character.  Which in ways is appropriate, you don't go boar-hunting or bear-hunting alone, but I'm curious - would you change your approach if you realized the game mechanics were unfairly balanced against the players?  Or is the expectation that the PCs should recognize they're playing Contra without extra lives, and behave accordingly?</blockquote>\nIf the rules reflect my understanding of the setting, I don't change them. However, I might not play in that setting if I conclude that it's not gameable - that is, there are few meaningful challenges because everything is just instadeath all the time for everybody. You have to be able to perceive the interesting uncertainties and challenges to have something to actually play.<br/><br/>I should say that while it is possible to make things "too difficult", my experience is that GMs generally vastly underestimate the level to which players are willing to rise. The thing is, if you've already decided that the PCs shall, by and large, live and prosper, then you've already made it impossible for the group to find out how high you can go on the difficulty before the players give up. They'll never have the chance to encounter the setting in all of its true brutality if you as GM shirk away from it. You have to be brave first, or the players never get the chance to be.<br/><br/>I should note that chances are that if your setting is so lethal that the PCs can't live there, then NPCs can't, either.

In particular, I think the whole interplay of "the GM arbitrates challenges which are likely well above the heads and skills of the characters" and "the players have to step on up and make up for the difference between character ability and exceptional challenge" IS the heart of fun OSR play (or, at least, one of the beating hearts of the beast). That's the key, I'd say, at least from my limited experience, and the thing which makes the game compelling and exciting.<br/><br/>As for hygiene, I was not trying to suggest that the GM making choices in the first place was unhygienic. Rather, I think that "choose two possible motivations and flip a coin to pick one" *could* be unhelpful to a GM who is specifically struggling to figure out just how dangerous a giant bird should be. The GM could just as easily have "the Roc wants to sink the ship/the Roc wants to eat everyone on board" come to mind as a first option. So, some additional principle or practice could be useful here. For instance, the GM could consciously come up with one option that's as mild/benign as seems reasonable and a second option that's as dangerous/serious as possible, and then flip the coin. Or commit to one or more reaction rolls or morale checks, and follow those through to their natural conclusion. <br/><br/>(In my last session, I rolled for reaction when I was unsure how a monster would react to a really unusually situation, and it led to the creature first hesitating for a long time, and then attacking with abandon. This caused the players' plan to fail - they originally intended to bait the creature and crush it with a stone slab, but it so happened that it only turned murderous <i>after</i> the Fighter stop supporting the slab. A transcript of play might look like the GM was deliberately screwing with the players - having a monster not go for the bait, and then very conveniently attack only when the trap was disarmed - but in practice it felt just right, with no unhygienic decisions having to be made in the process (and I was making the rolls in the open as well, so the players were on the same page).<br/><br/>If you have any kind of default mode for dealing with the Roc yourself, I'd love to hear it!

I wonder how intentional this is? On one hand, it makes sense that two or three armed men would have trouble fighting a bear; on the other, it seems odd that fairly common animals like wolves would be MORE dangerous than many frightening and monstrous mythological or otherworldly enemies.<br/><br/>I would hope that the high stats might be balanced by lower morale numbers, but I don't know if that's the case.<br/><br/>For example, looking at Moldvay (all details directly from the monster text):<br/><br/>A "normal human" has 1-4 hit points.<br/>An Orc has 1-8 hit points.<br/>A "normal wolf" has 4-18 hit points. (A "dire wolf", which is larger and more ferocious than a normal wolf, has 5-33 hp.)<br/>A five-foot long lizard has 4-25 hit points.<br/>A spitting cobra (three feet long) has 1-8 hit points, a pit viper (five feet long) has 2-16, and a six-foot-long sea snake, despite having a bite so miniscule as to be "little more than a pinprick", has 3-24 hp.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear from more experienced GMs why this is so, and whether it's just a quirk of old D&amp;D or serves an important purpose of some kind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432225/#Comment_432225" name="Item_229" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T09:14:12+00:00" title="May  7, 2014  9:14AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D stats are often quite screwy. Part of it is that the game has never truly settled on a clear mapping of the mechanics to the setting. Some D&amp;D sources and lineages have leveled humans as common-place, so you need to have wolves with lots of HD too to not make them pushovers; others only give levels to those who are exceptional.<br/><br/>Also, purpose of monster stats: there is a conflict between perceived gameability and perceived realism.<br/><br/>The outcome is that I wouldn't rely on any TSR monster manuals for stats of real creatures. For fantasy beasts they're as good a source as any, much of the time, but if you know yourself what a wolf is like, you're pretty likely to be disappointed by some nigh-random number brew from a TSR book.\n<blockquote>If you have any kind of default mode for dealing with the Roc yourself, I'd love to hear it! Your approach to this kind of thing is usually well thought-out AND tested in practice, so it's always interesting to hear.</blockquote>\nI would likely have an intuitive opinion about why it's descended low enough to be noticed in the first place; then I would just run that intent, with the assumption that the Roc is whatever I'm assuming it is - a huge bird-brained bird, a representation of some cosmic force, or whatever.<br/><br/>For example, we might arbitrarily pretend that maybe it would occur to me that the Roc only descends below the clouds to feed or to nest, and therefore it's wanting to either eat some humans or use their boat for kindling or descend upon something else close by. I would likely use my usual elimination method for choosing between those alternatives - flip a coin upon each until one is affirmed. Note that the first sentence is key, the second is trivial in comparison: I first form an understanding of the Roc's sociology ("it only descends below the clouds to feed or nest"), and then I derive how it might act here, given that we know that it's descended. I can only run a monster I understand, otherwise I'm reduced to bald randomization or defaulting to analogy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432232/#Comment_432232" name="Item_230" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T12:12:45+00:00" title="May  7, 2014 12:12PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What we're missing here is an analysis from someone in the SCA who fights bears and wolves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432236/#Comment_432236" name="Item_231" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T12:54:43+00:00" title="May  7, 2014 12:54PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that I've gone back to work, I get home around 2030 GMT and often have chores, etc.  So I'm rarely going to be up for 1800.

We visualize fictionally, and then figure out a way to translate it into the mechanics with the right level of abstraction.<br/><br/>So I can imagine a wolf might be a faster runner, or jump further than a human, and give it numerical differences from the PCs. So far so good. But as we have discussed in various places, hp is a highly abstracted thing - it doesn't really represent any one thing fictionally. So I am not sure how to assign hp totals to enemies.<br/><br/>Here are my thoughts. As you can see I'm quite confused on this topic:<br/><br/>For PCs, hp totals are assigned on two main bases: Firstly, high level characters are just more important - by dint of persevering and succeeding at the lower levels they have bought themselves limited immunity to certain kinds of danger. This is almost entirely separated from positioning. It feels more like a story-now narrative concern: This person matters to the plot so it's harder for them to die! Secondly, within the fictional positioning some characters are recognised as tougher - e.g. fighters. This is less important - only with PCs of fairly close level does the class make a bigger difference.<br/><br/>Do we apply those same principles to enemies? So important NPC villains get lots of hit dice, whereas an unimportant but fictionally very tough creature - like a golem - gets low hp? Seems unlikely. It feels to me like we apply those same two principles, but much more heavily weighted towards the second. Players look at the golem and know it's going to take a pounding. What about when they look at levelled NPCs - is there anything that signals how much hp they have when PCs observe them?<br/><br/>How should this all work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432256/#Comment_432256" name="Item_234" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T19:23:13+00:00" title="May  7, 2014  7:23PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Martin,<br/><br/>This is a conversation I've been having with Eero recently. We're at a bit of a loggerhead (or whatever the expression is), although, if experience serves correctly, he will eventually convince me to come over to his point of view, and I will break like a reed under the boots of an invading giant. (I'm not sure how he does that, exactly, but it's very welcome, so no complaining here.)<br/><br/>It seems to me that in D&amp;D:<br/><br/>* For PCs, HP is as you say: they mostly represent "plot immunity"/"story importance", with a pretty major nod to fictional toughness or combat experience as well (fighters and high-Constitution characters have more HP). <br/><br/>* For monsters, HP seems to represent, quite reliably, fictional toughness and size. (You'd be shocked to see a dragon with 5 HP, and you'd be VERY shocked to see a rat with 60 HP, even if it was a rat that everyone was very very fond of. But you'd be even more shocked to see both of those in the same game! On a smaller scale, if you meet an Ogre wandering around with a group of Orcs, you certainly would be surprised to find out that the Orc had twice as many hit points as the Ogre, whether because he was an experienced Orc or because he happened to have the important information for the PCs to discover.)<br/><br/>* For NPCs, there's some fuzzy middle-ground. Eero maintains that giving NPCs levels and HP is vital to the balancing of the game. I'm not 100% sure I agree, but I certainly see his point. (And most D&amp;D manuals and modules certainly take this approach.)<br/><br/>This makes it very hard to eyeball HPs, I agree. How many does an important princess get? What about an unimportant fire-breathing dragon? And the princess's pet rat, Snickers, who's an invaluable source of comic relief and everyone's favourite character?<br/><br/>One approach I'd like to try is to consider HP as entirely corresponding to physical toughness for everyone but PCs (kind of like how it works in Dungeon World). Eero makes a good argument for this being a potential unbalancing factor in the game, but I think it may work at low levels. The problem with doing it the other way around is: if we're really playing a plot-agnostic sandbox OSR adventure, by what metric are we supposed to allocate "plot immunity" to NPCs and monsters? It seems odd to include plot immunity as a feature in a game which very specifically does NOT consider certain elements more relevant to "the plot" than others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432257/#Comment_432257" name="Item_235" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T19:25:02+00:00" title="May  7, 2014  7:25PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I'd really like to nail down for the purpose of consistency in this IRC game, since it's so much more potentially important than other rulings, is what happens at 0 HP.

Then the scale is from 1 hp to the not-long-for-this-world low constitution wizard up to 20 hp for a high constitution fighter. PCs survivability could then go up by getting better at dodging, better at not being fazed when they take an injury, and having better armour and other equipment.<br/><br/>Various other RPGs over the last few decades have taken this approach I believe.

A hygienic move can and will be interpreted as deliberate, just as deliberate moves are often interpreted as random (especially if you've developed that old GM's habit of rolling the dice a lot for no reason at all).  Therefore (it seems to me) ultimately this concern with hygienicism is strictly an internal disciplinary exercise.  Like secretly deciding not to say the word "I" for 24 hours but not telling anyone.  Would this be a fair assessment?<br/><br/>Hope I don't sound rude but that's all I'm seeing, because otherwise it seems a little weird to be <i>so</i> concerned with matters of hygiene in a school of play (OSR) for which the most common definition is "rulings not rules".  So, it's basically an internal disciplinary exercise, right?<br/><br/>And if so, is the core appeal something to do, not with gameplay, but more with mastery of self, removing ego, i.e., dare I say "enlightment"?<br/><br/>Or is there something I'm not getting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432274/#Comment_432274" name="Item_239" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T01:18:08+00:00" title="May  8, 2014  1:18AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify, this "hygiene" thing is strictly something about how I myself perceive my own D&amp;D practice. I'm not trying to claim that it's something others should care about, these guys are just being all disciple at me, co-opting my own way of doing things. I do not claim that you got to develop a hygienic process to play a pure game. (And if that sentence sounds strange to you, it's because you've already conflated the <i>process technique</i> of hygiene with the <i>desired outcome</i> of fair and impartial refereeing.)<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I vigorously disagree with Tod's "illusion theory". It's a common conceit of traditional roleplaying that it doesn't matter how you fudge behind the screen, because the players won't be able to tell. I admit that this is strictly speaking locally possible, but it's not an absolute rule: I believe that over the long term, in general, players will be able to tell.<br/><br/>How this creative dynamic works in my experience is exactly like we see it happening here in the Grey Sands campaign:<br/>1) Play occurs, both victories and defeats are had.<br/>2) Players get committed psychologically, they revel in victory and commiserate the defeat.<br/>3) An ethos of machismo, of pride in attainment, develops. Players realize that their victories are socially legit, just like being good in a board-game or a sport.<br/>4) Legitimate play becomes an important thing, because the pride of success is intimately tied with perceived legitimacy of action.<br/>5) The GM is under great pressure to be perceived as legitimate. The players have both a motivation to affirm legitimacy to maintain this thing they share and to seek victory, but also a motivation to <i>test</i> the legitimacy - this time to affirm that it is True and not an illusion.<br/>6) As the GM makes difficult calls in ways perceived to be fair, as horrifying nihilistic void is faced and borne by the group, as beloved characters die, the players come to trust in the GM, and the GM in the players; they can, and want to, play Real Challenge together, to have mutual pride in their achievements.<br/><br/>Now, if we take a GM who thinks like Tod suggests above, that creative/social process will fail around step 5 or so; the players will, necessarily, figure it out at least on a subconscious level if the GM is not playing a fair, hard game. This Grey Sands game, for example, is in parts going through this testing; that's why e.g. I am pretty harsh about the perceived softness of Mike's process, because I want to improve the features that I perceive as quality in this type of game.<br/><br/>My understanding and experience is that a GM who consistently fails to provide that harsh counter-force and antagonism that the players desire will either have his game transform into a sort of simmy story-hour, or he will have the players become unruly, ironic and chaotic as their attempts at stepping on up seriously are frustrated.<br/><br/>I'd write more about the hit point thing if I didn't have places to be. It suffices to say that I find static hitpoints an entirely reasonable choice for D&amp;D as I understand it. It takes away a big cornerstone and thus changes the nature of the game's content, but it does not change the processes. A mechanical cornerstone changes, but the constitution does not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432275/#Comment_432275" name="Item_240" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T02:42:32+00:00" title="May  8, 2014  2:42AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hygiene, as I see it, are a set of rules that the GM and players follow that try to make it easier to reign in your natural desires to avoid the hard challenge. Some of these are externally observable, like rolling dice in the open - if you start hiding a die roll the players can call you on it. Others are harder for other players to call you on, and I think act more as set of internal morals - it's harder for you to pretend to yourself that you are not damaging the game's fair and impartial playing field when you have specifically listed to yourself beforehand "I will never do X" and then find yourself doing it.\n<blockquote>I'd write more about the hit point thing if I didn't have places to be.

So now I'm interested in 3.<br/><br/>I'm not sure you would have to change very much - play can still move through the progression of genres from the "fantasy Vietnam" of level 1 to the epic heroism of higher levels. You just need to make the players continue to receive fictional advantages that enable them to survive better. For example, magical armour that creates a force-field, healing magic, ever-improving reflexes, etc. Alternatively, you could just accept that even when the players are powerful enough to fight a dragon, that doesn't mean they can't die very easily if they aren't very careful about their exposure to risk. This is already the case even in high level play, it just becomes more pronounced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432277/#Comment_432277" name="Item_241" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T03:42:02+00:00" title="May  8, 2014  3:42AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2014 3:51AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be clear: I'm not claiming that Illusionism <i>always</i> works, nor that players can <i>never</i> tell.  But in this medium and plenty others, it works well enough, often enough, to induce a desired perception or emotion.  Which is about as scientific as you can get, given the fuzzy nature of human psychology.  The frequent claims to its ineffectiveness are not totally hermetic, is what I'm saying.  That depends on the hands that wield it, and the trust they bear.<br/><br/>In my longest-running and most "illusionist" campaign to date, my personal experience *as a GM* was not what you predict above.  It didn't fail at step 5 and there really wasn't much before step 4 at all.  My players approached my game the way you might approach a director or artisan you want to work with, someone whose reputation was already one of daily dedication to artfulness and meaning.  I was a fucking freak about it.  This was my ART, man.  It was precisely because of their faith in me as an artist and a compassionate observer of nature (both human and nonhuman) that my players trusted me with such things as their alter-egos and submerged feelings.  And yes, their characters sometimes died, but after being established through play enough to gain any sort of reputation, this never happened in a meaningless way.  But that is NOT to say they never suffered defeat, conflict or torment.  They suffered plenty of those things.  And it wasn't really hard to ensure meaningfulness to their deaths in a world like mine, where most everything the PCs did was either legendary or politically linked to something, and either success or failure would have hugely dramatic consequences.  But you might say my measure of success was <i>Dramatic Hygiene</i> (Aristotelian to Modern) - or maybe even <i>Symbolic Meaning</i> - on top of a Simulationist Sandbox.  The relation between the two modes was bidirectional, and a lot of dice magick was involved.  Psychic woowoo shit.  Works for me.  As a player I have seen a mixed bag of GM types and therefore come to realize that I'm rather unusual in this regard.<br/><br/>Not arguing, just defending (I guess).

(Although it does seem that for many of us here it is the only type of D&amp;D we're interested in, for various reasons - one obvious one being that we usually have better/more preferred games for other styles of play.)<br/><br/>* Eero's approach is what we're all trying to learn from or emulate, to various degrees (clearly we have disagreements on some minor points here and there), since this thread emerged from another thread which was, basically, "Eero, tell us how you play D&amp;D with your group."<br/><br/>* To me, the various principles being discussed are very important and very interesting: they're what's drawing me to this style of gaming, so I want to explore them and learn as much as I can.<br/><br/>* I can speak to the strength of the "hygienic" approach from the player's perspective, as well. There's a certain magic that comes from a shared understanding that, yes, *these tools we are using work*, and that we can trust them. Then there's another special thing that comes when we establish the trust in the GM: yes, this person is using these tools, and we can trust them in that regard as well.<br/><br/>It's exactly as Eero describes so very well just above: when you know that the GM is willing to both let you have your victory and throw you to the wolves, in as fair and impartial and principled a way as possible, it brings into play some very interesting stakes and makes achievement and victory incredibly satisfying (while simultaneously taking the sting and disappointment out of defeat).<br/><br/>That takes some work to establish. My first character in this game fell in one of Eero's adventures, under circumstances which felt somewhat unfair (or at least complex). But seeing exactly *how* he made the decisions he did and chatting about it briefly increased my trust in him a great deal; and makes me better able to enjoy the game next time we play, rather than worrying about the process itself or the GM's decision. Seeing how Eero handles those circumstances again and again, with my character and others, continually reinforces the sense of a solid, common ground on which we stand, and makes the process of play feel more meaningful. He follows his own principles (Eero's not a fellow who's all talk; he very much does as he preaches); and playing with him does give one this sense of objectivity, which, precisely as he describes, over the long term develops a very particular (and exciting) play culture.<br/><br/>I've also played in OSR games (very much attempting to do the same thing) which were not as tightly principled/hygienic, and, while they were fun, you could still *feel* that something was off here and there. Maybe it's not immediately apparent, maybe you can't always point your finger at it, but it does change things, tangible things, when the game moves from hygienic to unhygienic. Eero already described it better than me - I just want to chime in to say that it's something very observable, very real.<br/><br/><br/>Edit: Really, I only have two qualms with this style of play. The first is the big one: it's very slow and time-consuming, compared to many other styles. Unfortunately, that comes with the package, although it can be improved a bit with practice. The players develop their own methodology for things (e.g. callers, standard marching order, mapping shorthands, in our game, passing information on to new players in private channels, etc.), and the game itself also develops momentum as it moves along. The second is one is just minor disagreements with some of the rules, which could be improved. (However, it seems that the hardcore crowd gets its own pleasure out of the continual hacking and re-hacking, so maybe that's a feature and not a bug!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432299/#Comment_432299" name="Item_246" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T12:13:19+00:00" title="May  8, 2014 12:13PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (There's a potential game on right now, if we get enough takers, for what it's worth.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432300/#Comment_432300" name="Item_247" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T12:18:49+00:00" title="May  8, 2014 12:18PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll pop by in a moment, just trying to finish this article. +1 for your post, by the way.

Or "the kind of milieu we're depicting is not lethal". Or "this scenario involves challenges other than risk to life and limb". Even "our genre generally minimizes the consequences of violence" works. Not "I want less PC death". Most definitely not "I want less PC death, except I don't tell this to the players so they'll remain suitably intimidated".<br/><br/>Seriously, though, you don't need to justify yourself to me. I've provided my impression of your degree of willingness to hurt, not so much to criticize, but rather to provide a data point about what the situation looks like to me. It is useful data; as discussed above, legitimacy of conduct is largely in perception. If your refereeing seems to me such that I do not sense the blood-thirst, and I do not sense genuine danger to the Silent Dusk, then perhaps this might be the same for others as well. And without that legitimate risk any success is false glory.<br/><br/>(I should clarify that I don't mind you running a less legit game in these terms; I'm no king to determine such. It is also the case that a game can be legit while removing things like the wholesale destruction of an entire ship from play; you just don't assign survival of the ship as a challenge if you're not prepared to play for it. In such a scenario the focus would presumably be on the individual well-fare and success of crew members, rather than the fate of the ship itself. Or maybe it would simply be something other than a challenge-focused adventure game; roleplaying contains multitudes.)<br/><br/>The big, fat hygienic issue with not wanting PC death, though, is that a GM unwilling to face the nihilistic void is a slave to his aesthetic hopes and dreams. In the worst case this causes him to build invisible boundaries around the other players, protecting them from an honest judgement of their choices. Thus the content of play actually transforms from an even-handed struggle into puppetry. For example: when you demand players for initiative in a storm that threatens their ship, and they act upon the matter, but your threat was actually a false ritualistic declaration - what is that if not puppeteering, demanding that the players dance to your amusement? Worse yet, such a GM might end up determining the shape of their ship on nothing more than their own sense of entitlement: dance not well enough my puppets, show not enough fear, and I shall sink your ship out of spite. As you choose to not entertain the possibility of the ship sinking fairly, you have at that moment removed any storm-combating moves out of the realm of actual play, and into the realm of color narration. The least courtesy a GM can make is to make this clear to the players, so they can join in narrating, rather than dancing desperately in their false understanding of the interaction in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432302/#Comment_432302" name="Item_249" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T12:54:52+00:00" title="May  8, 2014 12:54PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, from the player's perspective, this rings very true. I've seen you (Eero) do this a couple of times, where you told us that a certain aspect wasn't really in question here, and we could skip over it with a die-roll, or just establish a likely consequence and move on. It's nice to have that kind of thing out in the open.<br/><br/>(Although I know a lot of players who would argue the opposite: that doing so violates the "fog of war" and takes them out of their characters' heads. In other words, they feel that not knowing which challenges are real and which are not is a good way to create some "unrealistic" uncertainty in the game - sure, the GM knows that the ship won't sink [just for the sake of example], but the players should still worry about it and plan accordingly, because the characters don't know that the ship is safe.)<br/><br/>(I prefer the former approach, myself, in case it's not clear from my description.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432312/#Comment_432312" name="Item_250" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T19:57:16+00:00" title="May  8, 2014  7:57PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Would we lose something important about D&amp;D?<br/>And what would have to change about D&amp;D so that it remained fun / balanced with this approach?</blockquote>\nTo my thinking, a fairly vital aspect of D&amp;D's design is the idea that successful play is rewarded with investment in the character played: if you are lucky and clever enough to succeed in adventures and find treasures and all that stuff, the game rewards you by making that character more likely to survive future adventures and therefore be willing to engage with higher stakes and more dangerous situations.<br/><br/>This comes about in D&amp;D in two forms:<br/><br/>* Increasing hit points<br/>* Improving saving throws<br/><br/>While I'm not a huge fan of the standard linearly increasing, big-but-rare-jumps HP progression in D&amp;D as-written, I think this is a fairly important principle, and fairly key to the D&amp;D experience.<br/><br/>I agree that we could play a game that's very D&amp;D-like in terms of procedures without these things, but I think it would be pretty hard to make it <i>feel</i> like D&amp;D. To me, anyway, this is a cornerstone of the Thing that is D&amp;D. (This may be personal taste talking, of course.)<br/><br/>(And I should add that my current thoughts on *my own* ideal D&amp;D include a much slower HP progression over a much smaller range, roughly imitating the first three levels of standard D&amp;D, but with more consistency. Like the way other abilities - say, your saving throws or your ability to hit stuff - work in the game. So I like the idea you're going for in principle here, but I still would, personally, want some improvement on the above to be a part of continuing play, to differentiate the player who sticks to one character and plays him carefully over the reckless player who creates a new PC or two each session and drives them to their death.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

I'm not trying to justify myself to you, but trying to express the validity of my choices. The idea that the ideal DM is free from intentionality and aesthetic hopes and dreams is rubbish. Or perhaps just not the Dungeon Master I want to be: aestheticsm has a place in primordial D&amp;D, or at least a place on the Silent Dusk. <br/><br/>The process is, largely, hygienic along the lines you describe. I've been strict with myself about how encounters are generated and the threat they pose. Perhaps I should be more open with exactly what's at stake and the probabilities I'm using? I'm simply that, in constructing the scenario, I just reduced the likelihood of immediate hostility of Encounters in favour of a more leisurely situation generation where new events add details to the ship's current predicament. Like, Leakage (and the chance of sinking) is a danger from the outset but I assume that if the players work on fixing the problem then the chance of sinking isn't on the table (in the Storm example, taking reasonable action to seek shelter of the cliffs meant that I didn't feel I could make a Save Vs. Shipwreck Roll). Leakage, combined with a crew mutiny (again, a possibility - the crew make frequent nuanced reaction checks to PC behaviour), a sea monster and other combined distractions will sink this ship faster than any single danger. The Silent Dusk is challenging logistical boat-operation game, not a regular wilderness crawl. In future I'll be more exact about what the parameters of the scenario are to avoid any sense of the players feeling deceived about the nature of the situation they'll be facing. <br/><br/>Simply adjusting the D&amp;D rules so that individual dangers aren't overwhelming independently of one another isn't unhygienic in your terms, I'd argue. Yes, the outcome is that character death isn't quite as ubiquitous as standard D&amp;D scenarios, but it doesn't mean the Nihilistic Void (the Death Drive* of PCs) isn't there. <br/><br/><br/>*Freud, a force "whose function is to assure that the organism shall follow its own path to death."

It's fun in its own way, but nothing is ever just *easy*. You've got to fight for every little bit.<br/><br/>For instance, we have a Magic-User who levels up, and is supposed to be able to cast an extra spell. The book says that a magic-user has a certain number of spells in her spell book, and a table which shows how many, at each level. "The DM may choose which spells a character has in the book, or may allow the player to select them." So what do you do when you level up? Do you automatically learn new spells? How does the DM decide whether to pick a spell or let the player choose?<br/><br/>And so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432473/#Comment_432473" name="Item_255" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-12T18:23:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2014  6:23PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also amusing is a randomly-rolled magical item, which is a Ring of Delusion which convinces its user that it is (roll) a Ring of X-Ray Vision.<br/><br/>What do you do with that?

Either use a better text or get rid of that neutenic tendency to hang onto the text, and the problem passes <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The Moldvay gloss of the magic rules is intentionally extremely simplified, as it attempts to keep concepts such as learning new spells practically out of play. The right choice is to use a solid process from some other text. Options include "you only learn spells through play" and "you get one new random spell each level" and "you get one new spell of your choice each level". I personally prefer the first one, I have no sympathy for magicians unable to research, seek mentors or discover magical tomes; those other options are only good if you're abstracting spell research out, so the players actually can't take the action to research spells.\n<blockquote>Also amusing is a randomly-rolled magical item, which is a Ring of Delusion which convinces its user that it is (roll) a Ring of X-Ray Vision.<br/><br/>What do you do with that? I've decided that my character (with said ring) is just going to appear crazy to everyone around him, constantly convinced he knows and sees things they cannot.</blockquote>\nWhat you would do with it properly would be that the GM would lie to you about the ring's nature, and then misinform you about things as you use it, until you realize yourself that it is not reliable. Evidently this isn't the way it's being used here.<br/><br/>What I would do as GM would be to require occasional Wis checks to not have the character act according to flawed information the ring gives them. The player would have input to what that action might be ("What would you do if you knew that there is a secret door here?"), to the extent of their mature capability for pretending such when they themselves know that the ring lies. I might require similar checks from other characters to realize that this character is crazy and not to be trusted, at least until they know him better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432493/#Comment_432493" name="Item_257" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T01:39:02+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  1:39AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2014 1:44AM by Johann.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"Colour event", "tourist sighting", "combat encounter", "deadly" and so on are all terms of unhygienic teleological thinking: they're all about what you imagine might happen either immediately or later.</blockquote>\nI'd add "warm-up fight", "interlude", "comic relief" and "boss monster" to these examples.<br/><br/>On a tangent, I've totally stopped using my large collection of battlemats.

I had intended for the ominous, crewless festival boat to reward those brave enough to enter with a magical item (a ring, wand or staff rolled randomly from Expert). Till the Sailor (Paul), a strapping and caregeous youth, busted in there and picked a ring, which turned out to be a ring of delusion where the wearer believes the ring gives them the power of a different ring - in this case X-Ray Vision. It's a shame for Paul that's the only "cursed" ring option on the table, but there we go. But how to implement this - expert certainly isn't offering up any suggestions. I felt the fairest option was to let Paul know about his character's predicament and see if I could negotiate some way to replicate the "DM misinforms player with potentially credible x-ray knowledge" mini-game (which is fun but far too much work for me) but with more player buy-in. <br/><br/>After all, if it's intentionally wrong info that the DM is dispensing in accordance with the ring's delusional power then you needn't actually give any info at all if the player is in on it - you might as well let the player/s suggest fun stuff! The only thing you need to be sure of is what the chance is that the PC will involuntarily act on account of this "false" information. So whoever DMs with Till next needs to talk to Paul about Wis checks and what that means - I hope he's up for this kind of dramatic irony. We had hashed over something like "When Till uses the ring to see through someone's clothes there is a 5% chance he will believe he sees a hidden weapon/priceless necklace/cultist tattoo/horrifying mutation." I think this kind of rule is fun, but maybe not the catch-all that would be more useful.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432543/#Comment_432543" name="Item_261" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T14:01:39+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  2:01PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the stuff you put in that spreadsheet might create interesting discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432544/#Comment_432544" name="Item_262" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T14:02:03+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  2:02PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2014 2:02PM by Paul_T.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">@Potemkin</a> -<br/><br/>I agree here: I think this was a good way of handling things in a campaign which lacks a Central Authority, and has characters often flying from the hands one GM to the next: putting the care of this ring in the player's hands seemed like a good thing to do here.

I'll go on, but first an announcement:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>Wednesday's Game</b><br/><br/>Speaking of continuing the campaign, I'm prepared to continue the adventure on the edge of the ancient battle-site of Thorgul-Hamun, TOMORROW (Wednesday) at 2100 GMT. Anyone who wishes to join in is welcome!<br/><br/>Chris and Daumantas, I hope to see you there - and <a href="/forums/profile/Jonas_Ferry">@Jonas_Ferry</a>, if he can make it, to reanimate Haidar...<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Now, the matter of the barrels:<br/><br/>When it came to apportioning XP at the conclusion of the Silent Dusk's voyage, we were faced with a challenge. We had established that there were 8 barrels of "gildwasser" (water that spontaneously turns to gold upon contact with other materials, as far as I can tell) aboard the ship. How much gold is this all worth?<br/><br/>Having no real expertise in this subject, I decided to come up with an estimate.<br/><br/>Based on what principles does the water turn into gold?<br/><br/>We have seen the gildwasser turns to gold almost instantly, and pouring a bit of it into a cup produces an explosion (the conversion of water to gold in a confined space is a dangerous thing! we lost a few men to this effect, I believe). This suggests that when water turns to gold, the conversion does not operate by weight (in which case a cupful of water would simply into a very tiny ingot of gold) but by volume. <br/><br/>So I estimated the volume of a barrel or cask, and various modern standards fluctuate between 26-43 gallons. I took the lower end of that, so 26 gallons per barrel. Then I found out how much a "gallon" of gold would weigh: according to other folks on the internet, apparently that's 161 lbs of gold.<br/><br/>How many coins, then, to a pound? In Basic D&amp;D, 10 coins count as one "pound" of encumbrance. However, in modern D&amp;D, there are 50 coins to a pound (this is more "historically accurate", if you're into that kind of thing). Again, let's take the lowest bound: 10 coins per pound. (That means that each gallon is equivalent to about 1600 coins!)<br/><br/>Now, a 26-gallon barrel of gold would weigh 4186 pounds, which gives us a low estimate of 41,860 gold per barrel.<br/><br/>Then I decided to cut down this number some: surely the barrels aren't perfectly full, there might be costs involved in transferring the water and turning it into gold, some lost along the way, and so forth. So I arbitrarily took off 10%.<br/><br/>That gives a total of roughly 300,000 gold. Yikes! What do we do with this?<br/><br/>(I have no emotional attachment to any of this, mind you - I was just fooling around with some numbers. Any logical quibbles, mathematical quibbles, or a desire to retcon things in the interest of maintaining the game on a certain track are very welcome as far as I'm concerned. This was just my shot at it - if someone else can do better, they're very welcome to it!)<br/><br/>(One potentially important issue is to settle on a standard for XP limits: what happens when a character scores "too much" experience? In Moldvay by-the-book, you get one XP less than it would take you to level up twice, but this seems overly generous. I believe Eero once said that you should just get enough to level, and that's it. A compromise like "halfway to the next level" could also work; I've seen that in some OSR rules. Anyway, we should add this to the list of Things We Should Consider Standardizing.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432550/#Comment_432550" name="Item_264" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T14:34:08+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  2:34PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran some similar calculations myself for Daumantas today, and came to about 100,000 gp per share - roughly a million gp total. Same magnitude as Paul's calculation, the differences are mainly in assumptions about barrel size and efficiency of transformation. I also assume that a percentage off that 100,000 will be lost in establishing the positioning of the wealth, in various types of graft and bribes and whatever.<br/><br/>Regarding xp limit rules, there's no methodological necessity for consistency in that - certainly if a classic turkey stuffing Monty Haul adventure like this one flies, then minor differences in xp limit rules are of no concern. For what it's worth I recommend allowing a character to gain a maximum of their current level xp limit in xp at once - so a 1st level Fighter can get at most 2000 xp at once, etc. That's a mathematically elegant rule that maintains the basic precept that a "full success" in a single matter is worth at most a single level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432551/#Comment_432551" name="Item_265" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T14:36:00+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  2:36PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My two cents: it's not what it's worth, it's what someone will pay for it.  So you know they're not going to pay market value.  Let's say, 50%.  150,000 gold?  Who has 150,000 gold lying around?  If you get a single buyer, you'll probably receive it in land deeds, bonds, IOUs.  More likely you'll have to keep hawking it to small purchasers in 10, 20, 50 gp increments.  How long will that take?  How will you store it?  Are you going to just pour it out into a quarry and scoop it all up instead?  How will you transport...?

The Grey Shores economy is in a gold standard, so there is a continuous demand for gold in the system, with almost any merchant capable of taking it in exchange, coined or not. Admittedly coining is a necessary step at some point, but it's not like the Archon's administration can prevent that - rather, they're likely obligated to do it themselves. So it's an expense to get that gold into spendable form, but not a massive one.<br/><br/>Of course there are a bunch of second-order concerns ranging from wholesale theft (governmental or otherwise) to the foolishness of the newly rich owners and even inflation (the total value of this gold is about comparable to the value of the annual gross output of the city of Carrion, so it's not insignificant by any means), but these will presumably be addressed via play one of these days. I already made a rudimentary offer to Daumantas - shave 50% off your nominal share, and we may assume that you get to squirrel the rest away as real money or investment in your preferred form of real estate. (In the interest of clarity, that's not a "rule" or anything, just a GM-type negotiation offer in case the player is not interested in micromanaging the complex socio-economic process that starts whirring when they get in town with a huge load of gold.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432555/#Comment_432555" name="Item_269" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T14:49:40+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  2:49PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I swear that's the XP rules as written in Moldvay, Paul.

Anywhere the water touches turns to gold (a localised transformation, like a chemical reaction) - the water is then considered "used up." For the sake of simplicity, the gold you can generate from dousing objects is exactly equal to the volume of water. The gold-water causes an explosion when brought into contact with mundane water/liquids because it immediately turns the water it touches into liquid gold (1064 \xb0C) which then proceeds to immeidately evaporate the water in contact with it. In a confined space (a barrel or cup, say), this causes an explosion comprised of shrapnel and unused gold-water.

I'll have to join next session and convince them to go back.<br/><br/>I played the first three sessions (starting in the city, getting into the dungeon through the stone slab, fighting in the throne room) and really enjoyed them, especially the latter two. Dweird is a great player, and Christopher Weeks showed up at the right time to help us fight.<br/><br/>It's interesting; I've been conditioned that there's very little hand-to-hand fighting in the sandbox games we've played. In Silent Dusk we've handled potential fights by using our NPCs (the captain cleric who turned a bunch of undead and the sultan who charmed a pirate captain). In Greysands I spent one session with Eero as DM, with my current fighter PC looking for adventure in Carrion, and the first session of this adventure doing the same thing. I think that the first session we played were 3 hours, if not 4, and in that time we only managed to figure out what lead to follow and get out of the city. The session ended when we talked to Pollux. That's why I've enjoyed the later sessions, because we start in media res and get to the good part (dungeoneering) straight away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432672/#Comment_432672" name="Item_284" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-15T05:01:17+00:00" title="May 15, 2014  5:01AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're not going to enjoy what's going to happen now then, Jonas!

It feels like we're capable of being pretty seriously bad-ass but if we screw things up, even a little, we could be wiped out.  We have reaffirmed the D&amp;D value of burning oil as a tactical resource (I intend to acquire more in town).  <br/><br/>I have only the faintest sense of what lies below.  What is the relationship between the Troglodytes and the Morlocks?  What's with all the crazy bugs and parasites?  What ecosystem supports that ravening beast's existence?

We only know what we saw from the keyhole.<br/><br/>For our operating capital, we have 9 pearls worth 30-50 gold each, a pendant worth 1, and a scroll-case with silver rings on it worth 2d4x10 gold. We will likely need to pay tax to the petty king.<br/><br/>We also have a major decision to make in terms of how we approach the king's scribe. The truth is that we need a buyer for all those books - they're the kind of thing that are far more easily sold to a specialist. He might also be a buyer for the scroll we already found, one that shows a relationship between the place we live in and other possible dungeons.<br/><br/>At best, we will develop a healthy relationship with him - the man is obviously interested in exploring wizard-king ruins, but won't do any of it on his own, and would hire agents in his stead. There is no reason why we could not be those agents.<br/><br/>There are of course obvious risks if the plan doesn't work out, and the man is certainly powerful enough to be trouble if he decides to be. Might be worth scoping him out, get a feel for his personality.<br/><br/><br/>As for tools and gear...<br/><br/>I prefer a mule over meat-shields just because our current location is still mostly a secret, and we will likely want to explore further in after we have secured the library.<br/><br/>If we do get people to go with us, I'd almost prefer a skilled craftsman over anything else - the lockpick plan is likely to fail, and we could simply take the door off it's hinges, or drill into it and saw the lock out. Plus, we could put the doors lower down back on the hinges, or construct wooden blockades of them, to better control random encounter flow. The lights in the throne room and so on are valuable as well, if we can dismantle them. Might be even more useful as portable sources of light if they retain that quality when removed from the floor.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to get some extra food for placating the morlocks or the troglodytes. We are a fearsome bunch, that much is true, but if a single random encounter goes for food we had left out instead of attacking us, it'll be far easier to deal with. Plus, I feel a little bit guilty for killing what are obviously pestilence-ridden degenerates.<br/><br/>So:<br/>* Drill, saw, hatchet, hammer, chisel. "Fighter's lockpicks", as they say. Possibly planks.<br/>* Spikes &amp; rope for climbing.<br/>* Additional food supplies.<br/>* Clay jars for the morlock infestation in its various stages. They worry me, I'd like to play young epidemiologist some more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432763/#Comment_432763" name="Item_287" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T23:57:14+00:00" title="May 16, 2014 11:57PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone up for playing today?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432828/#Comment_432828" name="Item_288" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T11:36:03+00:00" title="May 19, 2014 11:36AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2014 11:37AM by Paul_T.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The delve into the wizard hill at Thorgul-Hamun continues tomorrow (Tuesday), at 2030 GMT.

They hire four strange foreigners they find meditating in the town square, led by Nid the Elder (complete with Franz Josef-esque beard, thanks to Eero), and enter the wizard hill once more.<br/><br/>The stone slab looks like it has been dragged a hobbit-length by someone or something, scouring the rock, and the cut Lavender made in one of the tall pines appears to have... disappeared. Lavender carves a new notch.<br/><br/>They settle in for a three-day stint in the throne room, covering most of the exit with the overturned cart, and then half of them head down to the locked door they believe holds a valuable library. Lenly manages to unlock the door just in time: as he does so, some kind of enemy (only Nid managed to see who they were, and, as you will see, didn't have a chance to explain) rushed into the lower room, surprising the poor sentry.\n<blockquote>"A stone-tipped spear flies through his throat as Nid the Elder ducks, panicked, behind the corner, his body falling into your arms. Outside, in the lower room, where no one can see, you can hear more guttural shrieks - at least a handful of different voices, but not a huge crowd, by the sound of it. As you crouch behind the corner, you can see flickering light dancing against the walls: there's a lot of flame in the lower room all of a sudden!"<br/><br/>"Well, we did fill one of our vacancies specifically for the role of 'replacement'," says Lavender.</blockquote>\nThis is potentially a very sticky situation; we will need to pick it up "in media res" to see how it may be resolved.<br/><br/>For instance, is Nid actually dead? Eero uses a "death save at 0 hp" rule, so, if Nid's body is ever examined under safe circumstances, there's a chance he could actually turn out to have survived, merely unconscious. This kind of suspense (for everyone, including me as GM) lends a fun spirit of excitement to the proceedings. We'll roll if and only if it becomes relevant (for instance, in the case of a TPK, or everyone fleeing from the site, Nid's fate will remain unresolved, potentially forever).<br/><br/>As the GM, I'm really enjoying putting the various tricks and techniques I've learned from Eero, as well as some various OSR sources I've found online, into use. Trying to approach play "as a curious scientist", as opposed to a GM with any kind of deterministic agenda, has been tremendous fun. Using random tables (sometimes written on the spot), reaction rolls, morale checks, and similar mechanics in play means that unexpected things happen constantly, and often story elements are formed when making sense of those random elements retroactively.<br/><br/>It's often tempting to change the outcomes after-the-fact, because they "don't feel right", or are too dangerous, or too safe, but I'm learning to trust the dice more and more. I'm actually particularly grateful for the IRC medium here; by necessity, all rolls are in the open, and even when it might be tempting to fudge something, it's often impossible. (I try to make a habit of posting the roll and the established odds first, and then the system returns the die value afterwards, and this way there is no possible ambiguity. For instance, I might type, "1d6, on a 1 the ceiling crumbles immediately, on a 2-3 everyone still in the room can make a saving throw to escape first, on a 4-6 everyone is safe", and only after that is posted does the system give a result for the d6 roll. No way to fudge a thing like that!) <br/><br/>Making the process relatively transparent to the players is fun, too: twice now I've been called out for making something too easy on them, and it's strengthening my general process.<br/><br/>Here, just as with the attack of the beast last session (which was an unlikely "double encounter" on my random encounter chart), an unusual coincidence of the dice produced a tense situation I would never have determined myself without the use of the die. This particular incident has the potential for incredible hilarity here (and could have been even more complex had Lenly made a couple of different decisions while scouting earlier). We will see if any of that transpires when we resume!

My understanding is that being stupid rich removes the baseline adventurer motivation of more gold. Unless you have dragon levels of avarice, as much as we have is as much we'd ever need. This means that those specific characters need to move to other, non-'baseline' goals and motivations. One thing that works for Benbet is sheer moxy.

My answer is the same as before; schedule something and we'll see if I happen to be online. I don't want to ruin my sleep, so I'm prepared to miss out on the rest of the adventure.

From my perspective, I think we hit whatever the opposite of a "sweet spot" is between abstraction and firm fictional cause and effect.  I'd have been OK with "you'll save 4d6 books if you do your best" at the start and I'd have been OK with a chart of the shelves showing what was on them, what was on fire and then updating those charts round by round as the flares did their damage and we did what saving we could do.  And what you were trying to get across to us might have been easier with the full bandwidth of a conversation and the ability to scratch notes and drawings and stuff.  Interestingly, these bottlenecks seem pretty rare.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433692/#Comment_433692" name="Item_343" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T06:17:23+00:00" title="June 11, 2014  6:17AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my viewpoint the GM in that situation was relatively passive about either providing rich detail for micromaneuvering, or about abstracting the matter in a fruitful manner out of the fictional morass. The end result was that the GM was stuck in a "what do you do next" loop, while the players were relatively unable to provide him with specifics about it. So the GM keeps asking what do you do, and the players keep reiterating "we'll save as many books as we can, given the situation". The situation does not actually move into resolution because the GM is not satisfied with a general mission statement, and the players can't really make any meaningful tactical choices either, lacking another layer of tactical detail.<br/><br/>When I'm GMing, I try to recognize when we're stuck in these sorts of meaningless communication events (for example, I recognized this one as less than pertinent when the GM and one of the players were microing about their ability to smother one particular flaming pile of books with a cloak and a water flask, and I had no clue how many books were involved in that, and how many were meanwhile burning away on other shelves), and then either zoom in on an actually decisive fictional task, or zoom out into an abstract gloss of the situation. As Christopher says, "you can save X books per person before the fire takes the rest" would be a simple gloss; an ambitious GM (or player) might complicate that by providing certain basic tactical choices, like an opportunity to make a risky move in exchange for a chance to save more books.<br/><br/>From the player side, it's notable that the players can contribute to the process as well by demanding the GM for abstractification or clarification, and by offering their own deals regarding it. Here the players were stuck in a strict reactive position early on, partly because of the early GM declaration that the matter would be resolved "by rounds", which naturally already serves as a resolution strategy from the player viewpoint. The GM is generally the party with the best opportunity for constructive interference regarding resolution strategy - he's in position to choose the best method and execute it.<br/><br/>Not a big deal, but a good learning experience. In summation I'd say that the situation started becoming ineffective when Paul decided to resolve the book-saving round by round, but did not immediately institute clear facts on the ground against which the action could be measured. A detailed round by round action could have worked, but it would've required establishing more stuff, such as the total number of books, the speed of the fire in consuming them, the risk/effect trade-offs of the various actions that characters could take to curtail the fire, and so on. When the GM instead allowed action to move forward without the effectiveness of individual actions being clearly established, the action got uncoupled from consequences; very similar to what you'd get from D&amp;D combat if you didn't use hitpoints as an objective measure of efficacy of combat action.<br/><br/>Bold abstract glossing is the tool of choice for aborting and getting out when you notice that something's not working - just tell the rest of the group that this current resolution strategy is not working, and offer a deal for an alternate way to resolve the situation and put it away in favour of more interesting content. This is basically the same situation as you'd get in a combat when you realize that nobody's interested in the individual attack rolls for some reason - you'll want to abstract it away with a one-roll resolution at that point rather than continuing stubbornly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433696/#Comment_433696" name="Item_344" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T07:38:43+00:00" title="June 11, 2014  7:38AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Question for Eero (on the theoretical side) and Paul (on the actual in-game situation), given the way the book-saving effort went and where we stopped, would it be appropriate for me, upon hearing how many books we're likely to save, to offer a conversion of HP lost into books saved?  Like, "OK, if we bail now, this (whatever) is the situation but I'm willing to stay and lose three HP to the fire, in the form of burnt fingers and smoked lungs if I save an extra three books."

From my end there was an additional pressure of trying to get to my concert on time, so I didn't feel as much freedom to think it through as I normally might. I knew we had to wrap up somehow within the next 5-10 minutes, and it was clearly not happening on its own.<br/><br/>If I have some extra time, I might read up on the risks of smoke inhalation, but for now I think Eero's suggestion is pretty close to what I might come up with myself. <br/><br/>The thing that keeps tripping me up as that there is lots of smoke immediately *outside* the door, as well. How dangerous is it? It's hard for me to gauge. Anyone here ever work as a firefighter? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The situation is that there's a large bonfire (a large pile of sticks and flammables, plus a flask of oil) giving off smoke which must pass through the room just outside the "library" - a space maybe 3-4m/10-13ft long, and half as wide, with a meter-wide opening up into the next room. The fire has been going for 4-5 minutes or so. How bad is it going to be in that room?<br/><br/>If emerging into the next room is just as bad as staying, that will change the calculation significantly.<br/><br/>(As a general procedural note, I will definitely randomize this a bit, to simulate how the characters inside the "library" don't know just how bad it is out there, so it could be better or worse than that.)<br/><br/>Chris,<br/><br/>I like the idea of the schedule, and the visual layout is helpful. However, speaking purely for myself, it would need to be date-specific. I'm a freelancer, and my schedule is irregular, so it doesn't do much good for me to say, "I'm free on Friday afternoons". That said, if you three (plus whoever else) can find a time in common this way, that would be 90% of the battle!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433714/#Comment_433714" name="Item_348" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T13:12:20+00:00" title="June 11, 2014  1:12PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My schedule is also irregular enough - I can make space in it for a specific time of the week, but I can't tell when I'm most available day by day weeks in advance.<br/><br/>Regarding smoke, you might assume that people stuck in smoke are basically fucked when they actually have to inhale concentrated smoke - once it's thick enough to cause coughing, it's thick enough to interfere with oxygen intake. (Not so much because of the coughing caused by ash particles, but due to the carbon monoxide that comes with the package deal - smoke has basically no oxygen at all, I think.) The room ventilation and ceiling height are the big issues in determining how long you have before a room fills up with smoke. For example, that stairs room might take a long time (like, an exploration turn) to turn unsurvivable if the smoke mostly passes through the upper reaches of the room and up the stairs, leaving some quasi-breathable air down at floor level. If the room geometry is such that the entire room is swept by the smoke passing up from below, then it could be unsurvivable as soon as the bonfire really gets going downstairs.<br/><br/>I personally would judge that next room to be in a quite bad state already a minute after that flask of oil - it's a small room, and the stairs are positioned such that smoke will accumulate in the room quickly before getting blown up the next set of stairs by its own pressure. The fire is going immediately below those stairs, and there could even be somebody down there who specifically positioned the blaze and fans the smoke so it starts drawing up the stairs. (Once the smoke establishes that direction for itself, the draw of air pressure will keep it going that way - rising smoke leaves behind a vacuum that gets filled with more smoke, and so on - the same principle that makes a chimney work.)<br/><br/>Depending on how complex the situation gets, a GM could technically simply calculate the smoke volume to get a rough sense for how the breathability of the air in the complex develops. The volume of smoke released by the bonfire down there could be pretty impressive, depending on the pyrotechnic skills of whoever set it up in the first place. A conservative estimate could be e.g. 1000 cubic feet per minute, but it could range by an order of magnitude either way based on nitpicky details. All that smoke has to go somewhere, and as long as its air pressure is higher than that of the surrounding clean air, it's going to push the air out of its way as more smoke crowds in. Once a way out into open air has been established the smoke volume within the dungeon starts going down, but by then it might already have filled all available spaces inside.<br/><br/>I would personally suggest abstracting all this via the use of hitpoints - as you know, I interpret hitpoints as an abstract tool of measurement, and these types of situations are exactly why: they help us in arbitrary quantification of how much stamina each individual character has for surviving the worsening conditions before they drop and lose consciousness due to lack of oxygen. Just start with minor exhaustion due to reduced oxygen intake (e.g. lose 1d4 hit points per turn while working in a room starting to fill with smoke), and ramp up in stages until the players decide that their characters actually need to, you know, breathe air to survive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433718/#Comment_433718" name="Item_349" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T13:43:01+00:00" title="June 11, 2014  1:43PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually don't think the smoke is a huge problem for us as long as we don't stay beyond the library's safety margin and don't try to ascend.
