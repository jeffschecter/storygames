There's a situation that comes up not-infrequently in which you've rolled some dice, gotten some successes but two fewer than you need, and have the option to spend a fairly limited resource to try to get your extra two. If you do, you'll pick up one extra die (for that one 6 you rolled), roll it, and if it's a 4-5-6 you get a success and additionally if it's a 6 you get to pick up another die, roll it, etc. So your chances of succeeding are merely 1/12: 1/6 to get the initial 6, then 1/2 to get your second success.<br/><br/>But subjectively, I <i>remember</i> this sort of roll succeeding far more often than one in twelve times. I have a theory why.<br/><br/>First you roll your new die. At this point you have very little hope. 1/12 is pretty small. On a 1-2-3-4-5, we move forward, you failed as expected, failure result, etc. But on a 6 suddenly everyone's much more invested! <i>Despite all odds</i> you now have a 50% chance of success at making this 8% roll! So half the time that everyone's super-invested, you succeed. Because of silly subjective memory, you'll probably remember this type of 1/12 roll succeeding closer to, let's say 40%ish of the time. And (for me at least) this compels me to try/suggest others try the 1/12 shot, intuitively feeling that it's kinda likely while knowing it's 1 in 12.<br/><br/>Can anyone think of other mechanics that have this slight of hand tension-focusing? Or ways to get it more often? I think I like it a lot.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309552/#Comment_309552" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T12:37:47+00:00" title="January 25, 2011 12:37PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, people's perceptions of randomness is such a huge thing.

I've played enough in the last year to state that confidently**. There are some rolls with lots of tension and attention, but no rolls that get the attention <i>only when</i> they're more likely to succeed than initally figured. Well, maybe that one where you can add a d6 to your d20 roll. It seems to have the same structure but I haven't noticed the selective tension... it certainly doesn't do the "you started with such a low chance of success!" thing. And in 4e low-chance rolls don't really come up enough to try a direct port, as far as I can tell. Whenever I'm making one it's 'cause I'm using an untrained skill at a hard DC, or trying to jump up something, or running before attacking... maybe this is 'cause a +/- 5 modifier is common enough that any common low-chance roll implies too-common impossible rolls. Anyway, here's a straight port:<br/><br/>RULE: Whenever you roll untrained in a skill challenge, you have a +1 DC penalty, and gain the power "Discovered Potential: Spend a healing surge to roll a saving throw. If you succeed, gain a +2 bonus to your skill roll. If you rolled a 18+, you may use Discovered Potential again, immediately, without paying any costs."<br/><br/>I have a suspicion this still doesn't work as well but I think it might be good enough to playtest to see if I can understand exactly why it doesn't work as well. (Maybe players can't see a d20 result as well as a d6 result, for instance?)<br/><br/>*(only my new players must be better*** than yours 'cause their reactions are what caused me to really notice and then notice that I predictably had the same reaction)<br/>**(stating something confidently guarantees it's true)<br/>***(yep, better <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>... okay, it only happened after I had already told them how fate worked on a previous roll)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
