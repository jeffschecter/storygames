We'll have a LAN up in our secret base and lots of friends around the world joining our mysterious bootleg private servers.  It's typically an all day thing, probably noon to midnight EST.  If you'd like to play, let me know and I'll hook you up with the relevant details.  We'll also have a "dress rehearsal" or two to make sure we're all patched and in general alignment for the big day.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
