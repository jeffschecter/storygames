The show is a gritty police procedural set in modern Baltimore and it explores drug-related crime in the inner city. Its main theme is that everyone is prone to corruption and that it takes remarkable strength of character to rise above it all.<br/><br/>For the D&amp;D game, we wanted to get playing as quickly as possible. I used the pre-gen characters from Keep on the Shadowfell. They selected the dwarf fighter, the halfling rogue, the human wizard, the half-elf cleric, and the dragonborn paladin. The party were members of a new "Major Crimes Unit" for the city's constabulary. I asked each player to make up a Temptation for his character. This would be the thing that could corrupt the character, the thing the character wanted most. I got answers like "fame and glory," "knowledge of my elven heritage," and "causing pain and misery." <br/><br/>We brainstormed a bit about the setting. It was the default D&amp;D setting, but in a city, and with a lot of tension between the D&amp;D races. The city was carved into a huge dwarven mountain. The dwarves were nominally the majority race. They'd dug too far and opened up passages into Hell, more or less, and now the city was flooded with tieflings, too. The tieflings were nominally the main minority race, forced to live in ghettos in the terraces carved around the mountain. The eladrin inhabited the nice forests around the mountain, and the halflings lived among all the races, often in the service industry. The humans and dragonborn "weren't from around here," I believe.<br/><br/>First scene, we started with a basic street bust. I drew a "corner" of about eight buildings on a easel-sized sheet of one-inch-rule graph paper and tossed down some of my 5-cent wood cutout minis. Though all the tokens depicted tokens, we decided they were tiefling gangers. The rogue sneaked in via rooftop. The warlord and fighter moved in down the main street toward the corner and the gang leader moved up to meet them with his weapon drawn. I think the ganger connected and did some small damage to the fighter. On the fighter's turn, he used his daily power and his action point to go all-out on the leader, doing more than 36 damage and laying him out in one round. The players had the option to knock out or kill enemies when they reduced them to 0 hit points. The fighter's player decided he wanted the dude dead.<br/><br/>The rest of the party moved in and began beating on street punks. I was just reusing kobold stats for these and changing the "color" of the powers and stuff to fit the theme of the game. The rogue made creative use of athletics and acrobatics skill to jump around the rooftops, taking out the slingers. There was a momentary discussion about how "the rules don't let you do that!" when the rogue wanted to tackle a slinger and knock him off the roof onto another ganger, and I was about to say it was cool enough to warrant a roll, but the rogue's player found his Positioning Strike encounter power and used that to slide the slinger off the roof one square, accomplishing the same thing. Amidst combat, I ruled that if you were doing something in pursuit of your Temptation, you got a +2 bonus. Overall, this combat was fast, with lots of crazy movement and chases. As each ganger was captured (only the leader was killed), I flipped the wooden tokens over. At the end, I lined all the wood-side-up tokens against the wall and described how they were all cuffed now.<br/><br/>They took gangers back to their constabulary for questioning. I used the skill challenge rules out of the book: in this instance, they needed 4 successes before 2 failures to get a lead out of the gangers. They made quick work of that one. Then some of them wanted to cover up the brutal killing of the gang leader while others wanted to see those cops get into trouble. We made a 6/3 skill challenge out of that. They used Diplomacy to dress up the paperwork they filed, Intimidate against witnesses, and History to find useful reports in the files. In the end, the unit's commander (the paladin) and the fighter got a mark in their personnel file and a severe dressing down by the lieutenant (an NPC).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154207/#Comment_154207" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T14:22:37+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  2:22PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now we were all hungry for plot. The players brainstormed some more as I sat back and listened. They came up with a high profile eladrin murder, somehow related to a strange cult ritual. I didn't have to do anything as DM here. The group decided together to each advance his own theory of what really happened (The Crime Mystery) and pursue that theory in-character, then they'd all vote on which one they liked best at the end and that one would be The Truth.<br/><br/>The group broke up into three smaller sets of "partners." The rogue and warlord worked together, the cleric and fighter worked together, and I think the paladin worked alone. I started a large 10/5 skill challenge for them and took turns giving each set of partners a scene. They told me exactly what they wanted to do. They searched city records, broke into houses to find evidence, shook down witnesses, and so on. <br/><br/>It was the cleric who went to do the records check. His roll had come up short so he was going to add a failure to the skill challenge, but I offered him a Temptation. Cultists tried to recruit him and he talked to them for a while, and even was about to join their ranks until they asked him to get the cult tattoo (green ivy) on his face. He decided that it was too much to ask and let the investigation get its first failure.<br/><br/>In a couple cases, I introduced combat into the scene, often at their request. For example, when the rogue and warlord busted into a building from an alleyway, they managed to get the evidence they needed (we never even said what, because it didn't matter), but as they left someone unleashed giant "rottweiler" drakes on them from both sides of the alley, trapping them. They fought valiantly and used their various repositioning powers to get out of a really bad situation. The rogue tried some crazy acrobatics shit to flip over the drakes and his partner into a safer spot outside the alley and missed by like 4 on his roll. I offered him a retroactive +4 against his Temptation ("glory and recognition") if he was willing to run over the head of the warlord, causing 8 points of damage. He accepted, and the warlord (played by Daniel Levine) had to unstick his helmet visor as the drakes bore down on him. Eventually they both fell, and Daniel pointed out wryly that he would not have fallen that round if he hadn't been down 8 hit points... I ruled that the partners were captured and they suggested that they might turn up at the finale scene (we were running out of game time) as potential sacrifices to the dark cult's god.<br/><br/>I whipped out the awesome temple battle map from Keep on the Shadowfell. It has pools of blood and magic circles and evil statues and cool stairs and pillars all over it. I placed about 8 kobold minions, 6 kobold slingers, and 3 kobold wyrmpriests on the map but "recolored" them as 8 eladrin followers, 6 eladrin cultists, and 3 eladrin cultpriests instead. I changed the slings to short rods that shot paralysis beams, and changed all the wyrmpriest spell effects to crazy blue lightning powers. I didn't change any to-hit bonuses or damage numbers.<br/><br/>The rogue rolled really well to escape his bonds with athletics or thievery or whatever the rules say can break out of bondage. The warlord rolled an 18 on a basic strength check (DC 20) to break his own chains. The cultists slowed down the party with their paralysis beams (really just recolored kobold gluepots that immobilized targets that got hit). The minions maneuvered around to flank the cops wherever possible. The cultpriests moved around and used some large blast encounter powers to really beat up a few of them. The rogue fell below 0, was healed by the cleric or warlord, fell again, was healed again, and I think eventually fell again -- in like three rounds -- but managed to get in some really huge strikes first. The fighter dished out a lot of damage, too. The cultpriests moved to the middle of the rivers of blood on the map, which I had designated as "difficult terrain" (costs an extra square to move into each square of it), and they used that position to be safe from flanking most of the time. I realized afterwards, though, that it negated their shifting powers, and they eventually moved back out to solid ground.<br/><br/>Our slot's time ran out before we could finish, but the battle was definitely going the way of the PCs, so we declared the constabulary Major Crimes Unit the winner.<br/><br/>It was a great time and I think it would have been a fantastic campaign game, too. It definitely had the feel of a gritty police drama set in a weird fantasy world. The skill challenges worked fine, despite everyone's concern that the math is all wrong and that players can't win them. I encouraged them to "aid another" and had the aider roll a DC 10 check to add a +2 aid bonus to the main roller's d20 roll. I still may use the "Stalker0" version of skill challenges if only to add additional drama and tactics into skill checks. The Temptation mechanic was simple and fun. It reduced the "whiff factor" of D20 quite a bit and let me create tension in the story by getting players to have their characters sell out or do some slimy things to "win."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154213/#Comment_154213" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T14:39:24+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  2:39PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run "fantasy police procedurals" of various kinds for many years, it's nothing but fun.

For me, "The Wire" wasn't about corruption, it was about how the system, even when working as intended, drags everyone into the cycle of violence and dependance, and no amount of strength of character can escape that.<br/><br/>Your game seems more like "The Shield" than "The Wire".  In "The Shield", everyone has their own ambitions, their own weaknesses, and those are played upon by the corrupt until almost everyone is drawn into the web.  Only those with nothing to hide, or nothing to lose, can escape.  <br/><br/>I bring it up because I've been watching a lot of "The Sheild" lately, and thinking about using it as the premise for a game.  D&amp;D has that great "working your way up the ladder" structure, where you fight the kobolds, only to discover their links to the hobgoblins, who are connected to some orcs, and so on.  I think that structure can work really well with crime drama, where each criminal gang is controlled by a higher-up, and the chain will lead to some dark places, maybe even to the character's superiors, city officials, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154299/#Comment_154299" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T20:36:38+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  8:36PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point -- The Shield is totally about people getting dragged into corruption and eventually ruined by their own desperate scheming.  The characters there are mostly driven and obsessive, and the only way they can cope with the increasingly tense situations they're put in is to throw themselves even deeper into it.  But also on The Shield, everyone pretty much is guaranteed a bad ending of one kind or another...either the one they deserve (having brought it upon themselves) or the one they don't (having had it thrust onto them, probably by something Vic or Shane did).  The Shield is a story about how things inevitably get worse.<br/><br/>In contrast, The Wire is a story about how things never change.  Characters mostly end up having to make bad deals at one point or another just to keep playing their zero-sum game (which might be what Adam was going for).  The Wire says that the system never gets fixed, and all anyone ever does is take a person out of it for a little while (jail or flak from higher-ups), or maybe get a person replaced (because the guy who was there before is now dead).  There's no genuinely good ending for any of 'em, but they're not necessarily doomed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154303/#Comment_154303" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T20:49:58+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  8:49PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>I think The Wire has a couple of themes, including some about the futility of trying to change The System and the corruption one I mentioned. The Temptation mechanic was very easy to slip into D&amp;D for a one-shot. I love The Wire for showing people pay dearly for small compromises. Even the theme song says, "ya gotta keep the Devil way down in the hole." To me, it's about temptation and corruption. If it's something different to you, that's cool. If you want to discuss the themes of The Wire or The Shield further, please start a new thread.<br/><br/>For my D&amp;D game, I was just trying to capture enough of the flavor of The Wire while giving players some hard decisions to wrap their characters around. I wanted Vanilla Narr play, and I think I managed to get it without a lot of complicated rulemongering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154327/#Comment_154327" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T03:35:36+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  3:35AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I'm absolutely not saying "you read it wrong".  It sounds like a great game in any case.<br/><br/>Can you talk more about your "temptation" mechanic?  You say you would offer a +2 bonus for actions in pursuit of a temptation, but then later you talk about a retroactive +4 bonus.  Was that part of the rules you intially set out, or were you making that up on the fly?  It sounds like it worked out well either way.<br/><br/>If you were running a long-term game (which I think would really let these themes shine) would you do anything differently?  For example, a +2 bonus is a huge amount, probably the equivalent of going up a level.  Do you think that would be a problem long-term? What would you do about that?<br/><br/>I think there's probably a lot to be learned from "fate points" for mechanics like these.  Your use of the retroactive +4 certainly seemed like a fate compell, in a lot of ways.  I don't know that system very well though.  What else can be borrowed from it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154363/#Comment_154363" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T07:36:43+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  7:36AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I described the Temptation mechanic to players before we started. It was pretty simple:<br/><br/>1. Everyone had a Temptation that described something their character wanted very badly (and might be willing to do bad things for).<br/><br/>2. In play, a player could take a +2 bonus to a roll if pursuing their Temptation.<br/><br/>3. In play, I as DM would offer additional bonuses (even after the die hit the table) with conditions attached. These conditions were almost always compromises of moral or ethical character, tied back to their Temptation.<br/><br/>We were not worried about the bonuses being a huge amount. For a one-shot, it hardly mattered. For a long-term game, it would mean that the characters succeeded more (don't they usually succeed most of the time anyway?) but that they'd do things that created tension for themselves.<br/><br/>I can't remember the specific Fate compel rules, but there was nothing that forced a character to act a certain way. These were bribes and nothing more. Missed that to-hit roll and really need it to connect right now? How about a +4 to that roll if you promise to lie on your report? or if you torture the witness instead of just intimidating him? How much can I get you to sell out in order to win?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
