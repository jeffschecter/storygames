This was after I'd read that other thread, and a few reviews, and determined that the game sounded lovely and awesome. I will first grant that, even after having read the rules twice, I'm not sure I understood them enough to internalize them well. So there was a bit of clunkiness originating purely from my own inexpert explanation of the rules to the two other players. Ultimately, we played two rounds of the game, and stopped. The other two players were not enjoying it, not in the slightest, beyond the fact that it was a gorgeous game. <br/><br/>Afterward, I was desperately trying to understand exactly what had happened. I do admit, I'm not sure I had been enthralled by the point we had stopped, but I could see the appeal. The randomness of the stories, coupled with the sheer variety available...yeah, I can see the appeal there. But the other two players were absolutely turned off by having to pass the book around, by the presence of "matrices", by the number of steps required to even get to the paragraph, and perhaps most importantly, by the perceived absence of any way to influence the course of the game. Neither of the two players felt like they had any control over what happened to them, despite picking options out of the reaction matrices, and neither had any clear understanding of what they should be doing in the game. They were definitively looking for the game's win condition, its goal, and a way to drive towards it, and although I explained the win condition, they did not understand how to get from here to there. <br/><br/>There were certain failures of procedure which I could see having impeded our enjoyment. The two other players were not actually reading the paragraphs in the Book of Tales fully out loud...they were instead skipping down to the relevant "result" paragraph, and only reading that. So the full story effect did not really come through. And obviously, having played only a total of six turns, it's not as if it was any kind of definitive playthrough of the game. <br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed, however, by the rather poor fashion in which those players received the game. I thought it sounded really cool, and I still do. So I'm interested in trying to figure out if there's anything in particular that stands out as most important for making the game work. Getting into the right mindset? A particular ritual of play? Obviously, you have to have the whole kit 'n' kaboodle if you want the game to be at its best, but I think in this failed experience, it seemed the biggest problem was just that the players were not interested in the storytelling manner of the game. As one player put it, "I love RPGs, and I totally wasn't feeling this game." He couldn't exactly enunciate it further, beyond saying that he did not feel like he had any control over what was happening to him (and the rather tangential point that he thought each of the six possible characters should have built-in skills and abilities, unique to them, instead of having players pick their first three skills). <br/><br/>What mindset does this game require that differentiates it from the mindset required by RPGs? Or, is it that the players in question were not, actually, approaching it in enough of an RPG-ish fashion? That the opening part, where you pick your stand-up, and your three skills, should be thought of as equivalent to character creation? That you should come up with a kind of mindset for your character, a style, a way of dealing with things, and thus give your actions a context grounded in personality? <br/><br/>Or should I just find another group of players and give it another go?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307627/#Comment_307627" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T07:35:31+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  7:35AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Brendan, fortuitously, I just bought this game a week ago and played it twice this weekend with my wife and son.  We *adore* it!<br/><br/>I think you should abandon any goal of winning the game.  I honestly think that even having victory conditions is a little silly in this game.  There does have to be something that shuts the game off and these conditions work, but <i>victory</i> is kind of the wrong word.  In our first game, my son totally ran away with it.  Cathy and I had something like 1/3 of our twenty points when he won.  In the second game, he had something like 2/3 of his needed points when Cathy and I both arrived at Baghdad having achieved our goals and I won on the tie-breaker.  But that's really not the point. <br/><br/>The point is to have fun uncovering the character's stories.  Next time we play, I'm going to have a (or one per player) notebook(s) on hand and summarize the events that happen so that I can recount them as a tale.  Also, because the story is the goal, those reward lines at the bottom of the paragraphs are *not* the goal.  Skipping the flavor paragraphs is not the road to fun with this game.  It may well be that some people simply won't like this game (It's not for everyone...ha!) and they shouldn't play, but if you're going to play, read the paragraphs.  Aloud.  While doing so, replace "he" with "she" when you need to.  Replace "the other" with "the wicked enchantress" or whatever is appropriate to the encounter.  Use funny voices.  If you skip this stuff, you're skipping the fun and just going through the somewhat baroque procedures with no payoff.  I'm not surprised you guys didn't have fun.<br/><br/>Now, all that said, there is a game here.  There are lots of ways to seize more and more control of your destiny as the game progresses.  You don't get a full feel of this until you've played but the mastery of skills is HUGE.  There are some statuses like Determined and maybe Respected(?) that are likewise hugely influential.  The one thing that seems a little flaky is that you can start the game with three skills that seem related -- maybe they seem like they'd make you a master thief, and then when you try to rob someone it's asking if you have piety or courtly grace.  And you feel like it was pointless to build your character.  Yeah, it kind of is.  (This might change if you start to remember paragraph numbers, but I don't expect to play enough that that'll <i>ever</i> happen for me.)  So maybe speed things along by using the random skill allocation that the rules list as an option.<br/><br/>If I think of more, I'll write more later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307637/#Comment_307637" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T08:30:54+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  8:30AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2011 8:31AM by Ronaldo.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played this game almost 1 dozen times and I agree with what you said except that your character built has little influence in the game. I agree that it is a good"strategy" to use interconnected skills as it increases the odds of hitting the correct one during an encounter. I think that what throws them off is the fudge die but without the die the game would be too easy. <br/><br/>You have 2 main choices during your turn. Where to go and how to react. When reacting, players often forget about their skills and think what they would do in real life. So, if a beggar comes to their character, they want to aid. But, if they don't have something like Piety, they may get screwed. If they have Weapon Use, they are probably better off attacking the beggar in the first place.<br/><br/>The game is truly about enjoying and helping the unfolding of the characters' adventures and "victory" is just a timer. <br/>Some statuses such as an early Grief Stricken can be really crippling and I am not sure how I feel about them.<br/>Others such as Sex Changed pretty much guarantee that somebody else will have to win the game but they are still fun to play.<br/><br/>TotAN is not a game of creativity but of imagination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307642/#Comment_307642" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T09:09:12+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  9:09AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yesterday, I got Grief Stricken at one Story Point and had it through most of the game.

You have to come into the game without reservation, kind of throwing yourself in, reading the paragraphs out loud with vim and vigor and even voices, not just going through the motions, all skepticism and confusion. It reminds me of the things I've read which talk about why gaming (specifically in these articles, video gaming) has not necessarily hit the same levels of cultural saturation as have movies and TV, because gaming requires an inherent investment of effort on the part of the player, where movies and TV are much more passive. This is just a game with a particularly high investment.<br/><br/>To put it another way: I adore Dominion. Dominion requires an investment, but only insofar as you actually have to be trying to win. After that, I think the game provides entertainment and value. It sounds like for Tales of the Arabian Nights, you can reap great rewards, but only after you make that initial investment, which is much greater of a down payment than is required by Arabian Nights. <br/><br/>Is that right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307658/#Comment_307658" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T10:52:20+00:00" title="January 10, 2011 10:52AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would not go as far as saying that vim, vigor and voices are necessary. We don't do that. OTOH, skimming through the paragraph almost straight to the reward is absolutely the wrong way to do it. <br/><br/>I think the initial investment is definitely different in this game but it is not necessarily higher than other more conventional games like Dominion in which you are expected to play to win and to have fun win or lose. In TotAn, you are expected to have fun with the stories created by the interaction of the players' choices and the random aspects of the game. Otherwise, players are likely to leave the table frustrated (often early).<br/><br/>Looking for a game with a good balance of strategy and story, I have not found any that are better than Arkham Horror.
