It's the first time I've played, face to face, in well over a month. We hit it out of the park.<br/><br/>GMing: Johnstone (though he left before it finished)<br/>Playing: myself, Daniel (icecreamemperor), and Andrew.<br/><br/>I chose Coil, Andrew chose Demon, and Daniel chose Grip.<br/>We immediately decided that these weren't names, but roles.<br/><br/>The <b>Grip</b> was the person who could move people between the real world and the ghost world. Grips don't change appearance between the two worlds. Grips were immune to certain ghost world instances, and could transport things between the two worlds. Daniel's Grip was a 22-year old punk girl. She was in a Masters of Ghost-Field Physics program, which is the (largely theoretical) research program that some universities offer.<br/><br/>The <b>Coil</b> is a techo-shaman, an inventor and an adept at altering instances within the ghost world. Mine was a 22-year old guy, whose ghost world persona was of a ~50 year old tinkerer, with disheveled grey hair, thin limbs and a hunch. He had lots of cool stuff. Mostly it involved electrically-charged metallic rods, and leather gloves with mirror/glass components. Very teslapunk stuff, and it was fun.<br/><br/><b>Demons</b> are powerhouses. They are usually addicted to something in the ghost world, and their addictions and vices help fuel their carnage potential. People are scared of Demons. Andrew's was a small guy, always smoking casually.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Ghost World was basically Victorian London, but largely abandoned, and stacked on top of itself many times over. And then add "modern" corporations and runners, vying for power. If you were at ground level, you could walk into a building, walk down three flights of stairs, and potentially emerge at a lower ground level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>I had a detemporalizing stopwatch, which looked like a stopwatch hooked up to an aluminum coil and a thin blue wire. It allowed me to reverse or fast-forward through an "instance" in the particular ghost field we were in. When ambushed by <i>vipers</i>, I re-wound time: the vipers de-materialized and the cobblestones shifted back to their original pre-trap locations. <i>If only it hadn't triggered a secondary security measure, trapping us in a laser cage!</i><br/><br/>An airship emerged overhead, and dropped some <i>dogs</i> upon us - it looked like balls of slimy black yarn while falling from the sky. When they hit ground, they splashed into dogs, which were sort of like faintly-glowing oil slicks shaped like ferocious dogs. Once they hit the ground and splashed into this new form, they were running after us immediately. We ran into a building for safety. <i>If only the building had a stable floor, we wouldn't have fallen several stories into a bubble field!</i><br/><br/>The Black Circle was this giant, several-block-wide pavillion. Surrounding it were a ring of tenement buildings, caked up with ash and soot. There was a giant hole in the middle of the circle, the top of a smokestack that belched out smog and surrounded the area in obscuring ash clouds. I used my copper-plated hexoscopy rod, combined with my Hadley Mirrorfilter glove, to scan the area and detect two <i>spiders</i> draining a man. Spiders were these weird translucent orbs, a couple feet wide, that could grow long, spindly appendages - anywhere from 1-40 at a time. At the center of the orb, there was a glowing yolk. They were constantly raising their young within themselves. <i>If Demon's yelling hadn't attracted them, they might not have been a problem.</i><br/><br/>When the spiders advanced on us, Demon charged headlong at one, impaling himself on its legs, but crushing its yolk and killing it at the same time. The impaling didn't kill him, because he's a demon... it only made him sleepy and weak. I climbed the other, and jammed my Telescoping Mnemosynetic Rod into its body, hooking it up to a tube containing purple gases, and attempted to gain control of its movements, using the rod like a joystick. <i>The only problem was, it gained control of me too, and our memories flooded into one another's heads.</i><br/><br/>Demon's off searching for the alloys, and his precious chalk. Six guys are approaching him. A <i>hawk</i> just screamed overhead. I've hauled a dazed and confused Grip into the spider's nest, which is currently abandoned. I convince her that we need to go, now, that Demon has already exited on his own with someone else. This isn't true, but Grip is dazed and doesn't make note. As the rest of the spiders return to their nest, me and Grip evacuate. <i>Nobody knows what happened to Demon, and whether he found another Grip to bring him back.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269397/#Comment_269397" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T02:05:11+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  2:05AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This session was a lot of fun. When I first chose 'Grip' for my character I simply assumed this was my character's name (it's the first thing I wrote down on my character sheet, of course it's the name.) When the group moved towards establishing the terms as roles, I simply reincorporated my expectation by adding that we referred to each other by our roles when in the ghost world, so as to avoid giving away our identities.<br/><br/>This in turn was a kind of negative inference from other established facts/colour; that people looked different in the ghost world, taking on a kind of projected identity. Joe's Coil looked older and smaller, Andrew's Demon was a decrepit junkie in regular London rather than a phenomenally vigorous badass, and my Grip looked... the same. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the highly literal take on what sort of role a Grip might play. Grips all look the same in London and the ghost world, because it is a symptom of their absolutely stable sense of self. Grips have a strong grip on reality. This allows them to serve as anchors for trips into the ghost world. Without a Grip, you can't get out, or at least not safely. You also can't take anything with you -- only a Grip can get a firm enough hold on the loot to move it out into regular London. Since we had established that anonymity was important in ghost world missions, the fact that my character looked the same in both worlds suddenly became a liability, as well as a sign of strength.<br/><br/>After a few scenes I started to imagine my character as being unusually young for a Grip -- most are old, and consequently more secure/content, explaining the stability of their identity -- and so there had to be a reason for that. Some kind of driving goal or personal tragedy made the most sense, so I decided my character needed loot to pay for some kind of operation for her mum, who was invalid and required near-constant care. It was later established that my character and Joe's attended the same school in real London -- this combined elegantly with the previously-established facts about ghost-world anonymity and my character's real-ness to produce some nicely asymmetric information. Coil knew what Grip looked like in London, and therefore knew she was his classmate -- but she had no idea.<br/><br/>All these little examples of reincorporation and consequences built out of previously established facts really helped make the session for me. Normally, I am the sort of person who likes to spend hours and hours setting up a game world and establishing details about characters and even their potential interaction -- Ghost/World pushes pretty hard against those tendencies, and in the first scenes I was kind of wondering if our characters' <i>personalities</i> would ever appear. This felt especially strange to me, since I had established that what made my character uniquely useful was her extremely strong sense of who she was, and I myself had no idea who she was. I don't know if the game particularly helped me solve that problem -- outside of the suggestion to consider why your character needs/wants the Loot -- but once I got a few details down I felt a lot more comfortable.<br/><br/>Also, our Spiders are cooler than your Spiders. They were basically floating, spherical incubation chambers with an unlimited number of possible limbs -- spurred, I may add, by Joe's real-life arachnophobia nixing a traditional eight legs -- that build pieces of their future selves out of their victims. It turned out that Grip had a history with Spiders -- they were the reason for her mother's invalidity -- and a primary recurring Danger in the later scenes was Grip losing her grip on herself, after the spider attack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269463/#Comment_269463" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T11:07:50+00:00" title="April 29, 2010 11:07AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am really bummed that I missed this game.

Most of my gadgets involved conducting energies and tones and hexospectral wavelengths through my body, using me as human wiring.</i><br/><br/>When I botched taking control of a spider with my Telescoping Mnemosynetic Rod, I accidentally opened a two-way memory flood gate. The spider's memories dumped into my head... I have image after image of the spider consuming people's energies, collecting their dried husks, constantly nurturing and building the egg inside itself. The egg: it's both part of the spider and not part of the spider, an abnormal extension of its body. Simultaneously, my memories dump into its head... it sees image after image of me taking what isn't mine, exploiting others, to gain the resources needed for my coil projects. These projects: they're both part of me and not part of me, an abnormal extension of my body.<br/><br/>Me and the spider establish a strange affinity, as I take control of one of its limbs and force it to stab itself open with it, crippling it.<br/><br/>Later on, I'm dragging Grip to "safety" in an empty spider's nest - I assigned one of my 1's to the danger "you instinctively drag her towards a nest, as if its your own memory of a safe place." And when in there, we see what becomes of the humans who they husk - there are strips of human skin and tissue, flattened like dried jerky (but thinner, almost like tissue paper). These strips are neatly arranged in a big pile, on one side of the room. Gross! Coil doesn't even flinch. He notices a small pile of neatly stacked severed fingers, and instantly thinks, "Oh, that must be someone's term project."<br/><br/>It takes him a long, long time to realize that's an abnormal thing to think about a pile of human fingers, in a spider's lair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269488/#Comment_269488" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T14:26:55+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  2:26PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno (joepub)</cite><br/>Demon (er, Andrew) threw in lots of dangers that were related to his character's erratic behavior - GMing-via-his-character, in a way. <br/></blockquote>\nThis is one of Andrew's most GM-friendly roleplaying qualities.

I basically NPCed my character by focusing on her breakdown/inactivity in the face of the spiders, and the subsequent threat this posed to the group due to her 'losing her Grip.' She basically became a kind of recurring Danger, and I only took a few proactive actions on her part during the remainder of the game -- though I felt she was still there as a character, I definitely would have played her a lot more if I hadn't been GMing as well.<br/><br/>I did like how Andrew would present his character's reactions to social situations as Dangers -- at some point when Grip was freaking out he presented 'Demon loses respect for Grip' as a Danger, and I ended up spending my highest die to make sure that Danger went away. And there was no question that, certainly long-term, Demon losing respect for Grip (he had no respect for Coil to begin with) was most definitely dangerous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269490/#Comment_269490" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T14:27:13+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  2:27PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I gotta play this game.

The goal is: escape the Spiders and find somewhere to rest (Acting Under Pressure).<br/>The GM states: "Since you're running down narrow alleyways, your food pack could easily get caught on something. So, the danger is that you need to drop you're bag to keep ahead of the spiders."<br/><br/>Now, Hull's player rolls and gets 1 success and 1 failure. They can succeed with a condition (without food or water), or fail to escape but keep their stuff (and have to fight the spiders dead!)<br/>It's not a formal condition... you don't check a box or nothin'... but it's essentially the same function.<br/><br/>ALSO!<br/>When a danger partially comes true and remains, it's written on an index card.<br/>So, Hull and Vixen have been stuck in the ghost world for a week, after a failed abort.<br/>The danger the GM introduced, to some test or another, was that they were starving and lacking water.<br/>Let's say it partially comes true. "Starving and Thirsty" is added to an index card, set to rear its head at some cruel moment - perhaps when Hull and Vixen are running from Spiders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Akchizar" title="Akchizar"><img alt="Akchizar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/407/nK0KWE2DNMA2X.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Akchizar">Akchizar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272559/#Comment_272559" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T03:30:16+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  3:30AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally running this at gaming on Tuesday, at least partly because of this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who've played it: do you think there's any advantage to having some sort of "+1 dice" mechanic for things you're really good at?

Alternatively, sometimes we have it so that each Trait can grant a +1 to one dice (if using d6s instead of fudge dice) which has the effect of making assigning dice slightly more tactical (in the "appeals to our inner gamist" sort of way). I've noticed that using either rule encourages slightly riskier behavior, since there is an additional dice to buffer any terrible danger. (In my personal experience, this has been mitigated to a certain extent by the simultaneous addition of extra dangers-- nobody likes having things too easy!)<br/><br/>I'm not sure that doing so necessarily adds a lot to the game, but I've found it useful for luring more conventional gamers into our little corner of the hobby. Being able to write down something on a character sheet and maneuver for mechanical bonuses in play can be comforting to them, and having some flags never hurt a GM. Ultimately, though, it doesn't really seem to change the experience of the game very much-- it's just a way to tailor the game to the expectations of players accustomed to a bit more crunch. So if it works for you, I'd say go for it. But like Joe said, it's just a matter of whatever works for you during play.

That could mean having the right equipment, having specialized training, or even having a special, possibly supernatural, ability. If they say yes and narrate it, they roll an extra die. That doesn't usually mean there are fewer consequences, but they will often have at least one high-rolling die. If your character is really good at something, you should at least have the option to succeed, unless you roll really, really badly.<br/><br/>In Ghost/Echo, player characters are usually doing things they are good at, I find. On one occasion I actually had to remind the player that his character was good at what he was doing, because we'd already established he had a special power (he's like "Oh yeah, I guess I am good at that.."). In total contrast, when I run Basic D&amp;D and players sometimes want to do monster dissections or engineering projects, and I ask them if their characters have any background, they always say no, even though they haven't defined their backgrounds yet. But that's because they already have things they do well (character classes), so being bad at other things is fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272632/#Comment_272632" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T12:47:24+00:00" title="May 23, 2010 12:47PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, for anybody who is inspired by this thread: Ghost/Echo really, really benefits from the Fiction First approach. Don't worry about conditions, or the exact descriptions of moves, or exactly what is written down on the sheet. That's all there to give you an initial push, but it's still all suggestions. Just say what happens in the game. If somebody gets shot, and they are bleeding, don't worry about the mechanics, Keep describing it as a problem until it gets fixed. If that character tries to do something that would be easy for somebody normally, but not for somebody who got shot, now they have to roll. Or make them suffer harm more often.<br/><br/>But the resolution mechanic really only selects from the outcomes you have already described. It just pushes you towards certain fictional elements and away from others, so you want to spend your efforts on actually creating that fiction. Don't worry about adding rules or anything, except for what happens spontaneously at the table.<br/><br/>You can describe dangers they way they are presented in the text ("The danger is you suffer harm") and then get specific if it comes true, or be specific from the start. Although I'd suggest being vague, because having to come up with danger after danger after danger that keeps not coming true is probably the one failing of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
