When I actually go ahead with finishing a game, it's usually after I've put it somewhere people can see it (or it would be, if I could find the time and inspiration to design more :T). As well, I am constantly strapped for playtesters. I currently do not have an IRL gaming group who does well with the sort of games I design, so any playtesting I do has to be online or by other groups. In particular, I want to see a community that I can feel safe about showing a potentially disasterous game to, since it's usually the fastest and most educational way to learn what works and what doesn't.\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Do you want feedback from<i>lots</i>of people, from<i>a select few</i>, from<i>players</i>, from<i>game designers</i>?<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI'd rather see a wealth of opinions by fellow game designers. IMO, no-one can better spot the little gasleaks waiting to make a game crash and burn better than someone who's at least tinkered with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379328/#Comment_379328" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T15:30:49+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  3:30PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just adding this question onto what Graham listed:<br/><br/>Would you be willing to pay for it?

In some ways bringing my game to a table of paid playtesters is scarier than bringing it to friends or locals.

So I can't really answer the question, because my problem is that I have no idea. All I know is that I think I have a cool idea, and that I want to keep doing whatever work it is I need to do to get it to the point that I can call it "a game". <br/><br/>Game Chef did a wonderful job of giving me an initial goal, and some initial feedback. Now that that's over with, though, I have no idea what comes next.<br/><br/>In my current situation, I'm just going to keep working on my own, and trying to kidnap people and make them test things with me, and hopefully get to the point where I can release something and see what happens. But I'd love a place where people who have done this before could give me some guidance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379362/#Comment_379362" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T17:44:07+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  5:44PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should already be paying for your future playtesting by playtesting for others right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo" title="AlexMayo"><img alt="AlexMayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo">AlexMayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379366/#Comment_379366" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T18:12:38+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  6:12PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2012 6:12PM by AlexMayo.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>That's right, you, person who considers themselves a fledgling designer.<br/><br/>What sort of feedback would be helpful to you?

Ideally it would be good to get feedback from as many sources as possible. One thing I've looked into (and have yet to arrange) is to hold a formal playtest at area game stores. Most stores are looking for events to bring people into the shop and the two I've spoken to were enthusiastic to help out.<br/><br/>I've had less luck soliciting playtesters online - had a few nibbles on forum posts, and that's about it. One fellow who took a look at mycard-based chambara game <i>Void and Steel</i> sent me a fairly extensive document including numerous suggested rules changes.

I game over Skype normally (haven't tried G+ hangouts yet). I've been able to do playtesting online reasonably well -- my most effective technique has been forming a group with other game designers so that we can playtest each others' games (I'm not sure that would be possible now that I don't know where designers congregate anymore, I did this back before Praxis died). A while back I also had several bites when I posted an S-G thread along the lines of "Hey, does anybody want to playtest a game over Skype?" when I wanted to test someone else's game but my regular groups were overbooked. I've never been to a game convention. I suppose I could theoretically trek up to some of the Pacific Northwest cons, but that seems awfully expensive to me (hotels, etc.), and I'm not confident enough that it would be a good experience for me that I'm willing to shell out the bucks. Plus, I think I've already learned everything I can learn about my game in the one-shot designer-hosted format, I need external testing for the game I'd like playtesters for. <br/><br/>I'd like to find external testers, but haven't been able to convince many people to try it (I had one listener of my podcast spontaneously try it with their group, which was cool, and one group offered to run things for designers who asked). My game does some things that potentially alienate multiple audiences and isn't a slam-dunk for any particular community that I'm aware of, and there are some things about my personality that make me terrible at marketing it without knowing whether it works robustly (for which I need external playtesters, catch-22). I suspect I'll have more luck if I develop my newest game to the point where it needs external testing because it will be much more marketable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379392/#Comment_379392" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T20:45:43+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  8:45PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes it's more important to finish the game than get hung up on playtesting.

I feel like any time I'm talking design with players or people with a fondness for thinking about design who have not yet published, the feedback is only minimally useful. There are exceptions (Jamey Crook), but often when I just put my design out there for feedback the response I get makes me feel like the person providing the feedback read a different game than the one I designed. This doesn't happen when working with folks who are a little more experienced with the full process. I'm not sure how to back this paragraph in without sounding like a snobby jerk, but that's why I gave up on designing on forums a while ago. <br/><br/>The type of feedback I look for is usually very specific "does it work or doesn't it work" stuff, or sometimes suggestions when there's a gap in the rules that I do not know how to plug. Or sometimes I just want to talk about an idea and talking about it lets me organize my thoughts, and when that happens I'm just looking to have a conversation rather than get feedback. That's easy to do in person but hard to do online, sometimes folks are aggressively helpful when you're not ready for that yet and just need to talk about your ideas. And I get that people think those kind of conversations are nonproductive when they lead to no game, but for me that's a design stage that exists.<br/><br/>Mainly I get my feedback from talking with Jamey Crook/marhault. Since <i>The Final Girl</i> became a real thing I have an easier time talking to other folks who have designed games about what I'm doing but it's still awkward and I occasionally wish there were a forum that gave me the conversations I'm looking for but, as you say, it might be outright impossible on a forum. I haven't tested the waters talking design on Google+ yet.<br/><br/>The best feedback I ever got was from Ron Edwards during the Ronnies, but I'm not sure how to make that happen again.<br/><br/>All that said, 90% of my design happens in my brain, at the table when I'm playtesting, and for some reason when I'm taking bathroom breaks at work.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>You should already be paying for your future playtesting by playtesting for others right now.</blockquote>\nAlso I want to say, this does not necessarily happen. I think it's a great ideal for a community of mutualism and co-operation, but I also don't want new game designers to start shoveling shit and then be like "What happened?" when nobody playtests their game anyway. My name is in playtester credits quite a bit I think, and the amount of people who have reciprocated for my games has been, like, one guy. And I'm not bitter. People are busy, my design sounds boring, or whatever. It's cool! I don't always want to playtest someone's brand new game idea either. But who <i>you</i> playtest for has, in my experience, little to do with the willingness of people to playtest your stuff.<br/><br/>I think thin playtesting is a fact of life until you establish a body of work that has people excited about your new projects, or until you become someone who is way socially savvy about connecting with a wide variety of people who are open to your stuff and willing to suffer to help you make it. I'm working on the former because I know the latter will never happen. I think if you're worried about the amount of playtesting your game has (not) received and see no way to get further playtesting in a reasonable timeline, you should:<br/><br/>- Call it quits and give up.<br/>- Suck up the fact that you have created an imperfect thing, but create it anyway and alter your price point so that you can release it in good conscience (to the point of a free release if necessary, as Jonathan suggested). But keep running it, keep playing it, keep promoting it when possible.

I am unpublished, though. When I designed my first game for Game Chef 2009, I believed I wanted feedback but I didn't really know what I wanted (eventually I figured out that I needed to have an engaged conversation about what was or wasn't working in the game, because talking about it helped me think about it in a different way than when I was just staring at it). What has mostly helped me develop that game has been playtesting. I've also gotten some feedback about the text itself which has made it more digestible, but I haven't gotten as much of that as I would like. I think it would be really cool to get some "usability testing" on that text, where somebody reads it and records their emotional responses to it, as well as areas where they get confused, frustrated, etc. External playtesting is what I'd consider most useful (and I'd be more interested in an actual recording than an after-the-fact text report which doesn't always capture everything that goes on during a test). Having people read my text and respond positively to it would also help me keep motivated on the project.<br/><br/>For this year's Game Chef, I realized that I didn't care too much about feedback for my entry since I knew it was ready to be playtested and that the text also had some issues caused by the constraints of the contest. I was gratified when one of my reviewers with a reputation as a designer said that there were novel and clever ideas in the game -- that helped my ego and motivation -- but, as expected, I didn't get much new insight into the game from the reviews (although it did feel somewhat validating to see that I wasn't surprised by any of the issues raised in the reviews). I assume I felt less need for feedback because I'm a better designer now.<br/><br/>In terms of who I'd like to get feedback from, getting attention from recognized designers or community members is valuable for motivation and keeping a positive attitude. Having conversations with people who have read many games, understand design, and are conversant with the "state of the art" can be useful in actually developing ideas.<br/><br/>I posted in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16568&amp;page=1#Comment_379345" rel="nofollow">other thread</a> about useful feedback I've received: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>The most useful feedback I ever got from a forum was on Joshua A.C. Newman's Game Designer Studio forum, where Simon Carryer told me that the way I wrote one of my earlier drafts with lots of Capitalized Terms for game terms that were Important to the Procedures made the text read like it was Very Pretentious. The focus there was much more on layout and presentation, which I think could have been very cool if my game had been in the proper state to talk about that stuff when the forum was active. I did create a thread talking about layout stuff for my game here on S-G, and I eventually got some feedback that I think was useful, but it was not easy to get people to express their viewpoints in a way that I could understand them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>You should already be paying for your future playtesting by playtesting for others right now.</blockquote>\nAlso I want to say, this does not necessarily happen.<br/>Yes.

With two kids, each doing their own things (soccer, piano, scouts, whatever), so most of my game time is usually spent playing games at their level )<br/><br/>Luckily, I belong to a group that meets every two weeks solely for the purpose of playtesting board games. So, I've got that going for me. On the other hand, even within this group of people who are willing to commit a few hours a month to "games that are mostly likely going to suck," (from a viewpoint of this board), they really don't have much interest in anything RPG-ish. And then you get further into the depths of certain people only really interested in playing certain sub-genres: "Chuck hates games with traitor mechanics." <br/><br/>********<br/>As another side note, I managed to sneak in a game of Fiasco with a friend and member of this playtesting group and the wives a while ago. While it seemed like everyone had a blast playing it (with lot's of laughter), at the end, the designer buddy basically said that in the end, he would rather not play it again, because it seemed like too much acting, and therefore, too much work. He'd much rather have to roll dice against whatever a monster a DM throws at him if he's going to play a RPG.<br/><br/>He did try out my Epistolary game with me, for a time, which was nice...until Minecraft sucked away his time and he stopped playing...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379466/#Comment_379466" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T07:56:16+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  7:56AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll take you right through what I used and could use, for GLASS:<br/><br/>* Initial feedback on basic systems - Saved me a LOT of time balancing and writing, having experienced LARPers discuss possible ramifications (or outright borkenness) of some Abilities. And do I have everything you think I need (put another way, can you make Your Character, or is some element missing)?<br/><br/>* Playtest - With a generic, modular system, a lot of bits and pieces need to be rubbed against each other. How do Abilities A, X, and 4 interact, in actual play at full speed? Similarly, Break This System: find some wonky combination that makes trouble. It doesn't help that a game like mine has particular venue requirements (mainly privacy and safety concerns).<br/><br/>* Production - I happen to be a print designer, so production questions would be limited to basic proofreading and general aesthetic opinions.<br/><br/>Would I pay for any of the above? Well... sort of. I am considering running a Kickstarter to fund playtesting, so I could run "full scale" games at a local state park that hosts other LARPs. Promotion + free weekend should get me a LOT of attendees, compared to promotion + $20 or more for the weekend. And because I'm giving it away free, I could do more to "drive" the test than I'd try to do with a paying group being conscripted to "beta test" (which is the default mode for LARP rule development! ;0 ). I could, say, give pre-gens on the first evening and afternoon, then let folks build with Packages before the second night and afternoon. I could run post-apoc on day one, to test projectiles and "tech flavored" Abilities, then switch to neolithic on day two to focus on basic melee and totem magic and raw Situational Ability tests/challenges.<br/><br/>Why haven't I done that already? Well, because I can't get past "break the system" requests--I got, like, about four (three of which had either barely skimmed the rules or couldn't follow their terseness--they weren't "break the system" but rather" ignore the system, violate basic rules, and think you broke it"). So I am sort of stuck between wanting to expand the rule text, but not wanting to have the ripple effect of broke rules permeating a "complete" rule document (not an SRD), but not being able to get enough eyes and crackers on the rules to find the broke bits before they permeate the rules. Rules I need to have any hope of a major play test. And around and around we go....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379659/#Comment_379659" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T11:23:42+00:00" title="May 24, 2012 11:23AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2012 11:25AM by Arpie.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the hardest thing for me has always been being able to fix stuff that people want in the game. Someone comes along and says "this would be really cool if..." and throws out a vague idea for a new rule that I have no idea how to work into the structure of the game. So I usually table the game. Very depressing, actually.<br/><br/>Mostly what I want to know is:<br/>Can you figure out how to play the game?<br/>What's the hardest thing to understand? What's the clearest?<br/>Under what circumstances would you play this game?<br/>If you do happen to be generous enough to play the game, what was the most fun part? The least fun?<br/>Do the rules of the game seem to match the spirit in which it was written? Does it tell the kind of story it seems to want to impart?<br/>Were there any glaring typographical, layout or technical errors?<br/>At any point, did blood begin running out of your eyes? Was this a good or a bad thing?<br/>Who would you reccommend this game to? Older players? Younger? Enemies? Friends?<br/>What kind of story did you think this game was trying to tell, anyway?<br/>What genres do you think might work with this game?<br/>What cool rules hacks have you already thought of based on this set of mechanics (that I can use and include as maybe an appendix or something?)<br/>Generally negative but specific layout advice (your background colors make the text hard to read. Your arrangement of materials is counter-intuitive and difficult to navigate. why did you use so many pictures of Megan Fox?)<br/>Possible ramifications of the things I might have overlooked. (Yes, that's stolen from the last post, but I really need to know it.)<br/>Technical difficulties players had in trying to acquire the design materials.<br/>Genre-specific suggestions for lists that I might have overlooked. (I might have just not had the space, too.)<br/><br/>Just to let you know, what I don't care about is:<br/>The other game that you really think is cool that you'd rather play instead of this one. Really, I'm just going to ignore a post like that so it's a wasted effort on your part.<br/>The game you're working on that's much better than this one.<br/>Cool rules ideas you're using in your own game (because I really don't want to steal your stuff if we're not collaborating.) - If you WANT everyone to use the idea, cool. I'll take it!<br/>My general inability to be a trailblazer in a Post-Forge environment. (I'm fully aware that my talents lie elsewhere. Thanks.) <br/>Advice on where to go to fund my game and its distribution... unless it's really good advice and doesn't use the word "kickstarter" in any way, shape or form.<br/>Genre-specific suggestions for lists that cause a clear and intentional breach of copywrite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
