It seemed to stress, in a sense, the importance of establishing a Social Contract of sorts with other players.

I got all excited when he talked about "Jonny" "expressing something" through play, but I think the agenda is fundamentally different to Narrativism.  What's being expressed is not a story.<br/><br/>I think the biggest difference is that, while GNS talks about what actually happens at the table, in terms of what people do, "JTS" (As I'll call it) talks about who people are.  I think this is interesting.  Are there fundamentally different types of people who enjoy Gamist play? Or can your agenda switch? <br/><br/>I think that Gamism is a kind of unexplored field in game design, in that it seems poorly understood how to make a properly satisfying Gamist challenge.

I was very much a Johnny - more specifically, a "Deck Artist" - when I played M:tG (3rd and 4th edition, which was what - about a hundred years ago or so?). Long before WotC released "theme decks", I was building nothing but. Highly focused decks with one or two themes to them, such as the Goblin Invasion that would be pathetic until the Goblins found themselves a King to lead them and the Lightning Bolts started raining, or the Thallid deck that spawned a ton of weak fungi in defense until the forest could finally summon the dread Craw Wurm to strike back, or the Merfolk who fought a bitter battle using poisons, confusion and trickery to wear down the opponent's library.<br/><br/>This would often frustrate my Spikey friends, who would endlessly wonder why I didn't just include this or that card to counteract their optimized decks of doom. Doing so would damage the artistic integrity of my decks, though, and I balked at the idea. To me, when I played, a story was generated in my head - when the Instants and Interrupts started flying back and forth, it was an actual magical duel of wits taking place, not just the result of a lucky draw. By including elements in my deck that didn't belong, I would mess with the consistency of that story and ruin my fun.<br/><br/>Maybe that was a very unique experience - maybe other Johnnies aren't like that - but it was something I greatly enjoyed at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83405/#Comment_83405" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T00:22:34+00:00" title="July 26, 2007 12:22AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I don't want to be a theory snob, but what you're describing isn't Narrativism, it's Simulationism.  <br/><br/>But I know what you're talking about, it's how I always loved to play Magic as well.

I don't agree with the idea of a strong disconnect between Narrativism and Simulationism, and this is a great example of why. To me, the story-in-my-head cannot take place if the world (i.e. the cards on the table) are inconsistent. I have seen this also in playing games that aim for strong Narrative elements <i>at the expense</i> of Simulationism, by randomizing elements and leaving it up to the players to make sense of it. Sometimes the randomness is simply too chaotic to make any sense of, and the resulting story falls flat. The best story-generating games are highly thematic, for a very good reason - the same reason I would refuse to include cards in my deck that could mess up the story.<br/><br/>I recently got a chance to test the Game of Thrones CCG and it supported my playstyle much better than Magic ever did, because of the strong thematic components. My one complaint is that deck building was much more structured, which limits my abilities to design my own unique theme more than M:tG did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83610/#Comment_83610" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T07:00:09+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  7:00AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first article is much more interesting to me from a theory perspective.
