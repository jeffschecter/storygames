I'm imagining it totally overwrought, convoluted, with extreme graphic gore.  Rather than wirework, you'd have gory vampire fights where they got totally savage and bit off noses and pulled out intestines.  Judging follows the squick-standard.  At then end of the day, they're vampires, and so it's not like getting chainsawed into chunks will really kill them.  Getting killed as a melodramatic gothic vampire is all about getting your <i>heart broken. </i> <br/><br/>-B                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165065/#Comment_165065" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T18:36:12+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  6:36PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm glad you're excited! Optional vampire rules:</p>\n<p>If you're a vampire, you have an additional knife action. When you receive the unsheathed knife, you may <strong>Bite</strong> the instigator.</p>\n<p>When you are Bitten by a vampire, you may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fall Under His Sway and make a wish</li>\n<li>Stake the vampire</li>\n<li>Wirework.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may not deflect.</p>\n<p>If you Stake a vampire, he may Escalate to Biting you. Ultimata can still only be issued in response to Staking.</p>\n<p>If you are Under X's Sway, when X makes a knife demand of you, you may only Accept, or Deflect to someone Under <em>your</em> Sway.</p>\n<p>Sway is transitive. If X is Under Y's Sway, and Y is Under Z's Sway, X is Under Z's Sway.</p>\n<p>If there X and Y are in a Wirework sequence and X is a vampire, there is an additional victory option: "Y becomes a vampire." Either player may choose this victory, but as usual both players must choose a different victory.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
