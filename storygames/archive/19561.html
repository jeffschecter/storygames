DNS was created. Ronald Reagan started his second term after thrashing Walter Mondale.  Wrestlemania debuted. New Coke, right? You remember New Coke?  Back to the Future. The Amiga personal computer. The Nintendo Entertainment System.  Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker, is captured in Los Angeles. <br/><br/>In comics, Marvel published Heroes for Hope to raise money for African aid.  The Crisis on Infinite Earths and the second Secret War occurred.  The Outsiders started operating and the Avengers opened their West Coast branch.  Supergirl, Barry Allen, and Jean DeWolff all died.  Donna Troy married Terry Long.  New characters included Black Mask, Dr. Light, Strong Guy, Andrea and Andreas von Strucker, Firestar, Longshot, Mojo, and Silver Sable.  Batman is at the ebb of his popularity - the least popular and least inspiring he has ever been since his introduction.  His revitalization by Frank Miller in The Dark Knight Returns is still three years away.<br/><br/>Mayfair Games held the DC comics license.<br/><br/><a href="http://imgur.com/cxsWHCz" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/cxsWHCz.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>And you were going to get a group together.<br/><br/>Now, the players had all read the player's guide and anyone who was interested had read the GM's guide too. (It was actually almost mandatory if you were playing someone who turned into animals since that's where the animal stats were. That means you, Beast Boy.)<br/><br/>So let's talk about what a GM does in the DC Heroes Role Playing Game.<br/><br/>The first two pages are a breakdown of how the system works. It says it's optional, you can just use the system, you don't need to know the mathematical basis.  And even if you read it it says not to worry about being precise. Uh, okay. I guess we'll skip it.  Except to note that it takes approximately 8 times as much brainpower to memorize one of each issue of DC comics for a year as it does to memorize Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace.</i>   We didn't know what LOL meant in 1985, so I guess we just actually laughed out loud.<br/><br/>The next page is a way to generate experience awards. Seems a pretty straightforward procedure.<br/><br/>Hey, how come "what a gamemaster actually does in the group" doesn't start until page 6?<br/><br/>Oh well. Here we are on page 6, and I can tell right away it's gonna be a doozy.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434892/#Comment_434892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T22:36:00+00:00" title="July  5, 2014 10:36PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay!

Epitome of unification/easy, not to mention unique (at least for the time).<br/><br/>It made it possible to equate seemingly unrelated things which comes in handy for a system that deals in varied superpowers. <br/><br/>It also made the math for such things ridiculously easy. The whole time/distance/speed thing for instance.<br/><br/>It was a rational logarithmic scale. No more weird randomness of scale with infinite exceptions (I'm looking at you pre-3rd D&amp;D). <br/><br/>It was iconic. For us, the 'best systems' were those that stood out in some aspect. They're systems where the mechanics reinforce the concept/playstyle...focus it and make it shine. The AP system certainly did that with DC. We played DC and Marvel regularly. Not for the worlds or characters, but for the underlying systems. To be fair, I think marvel was better...both in mechanics and printed materials. I say that as someone who mostly prefers the DC universe overall. Still, DC was iconic enough to give it a spot on all our shelves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434987/#Comment_434987" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T20:47:52+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  8:47PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>The AP equivalency was a MASTERWORK.

BUT LET'S CONTINUE.\n<blockquote>The Gamemaster...is like the director of a play and the Players' characters are like the characters in that play.  Both the Gamemaster and the Players are also the audience and, as the participants and the audience they can play against each other's actions and enjoy the unfolding story they create at the same time.<br/><br/>Unlike the director of a play, the Gamemaster only has a slim framework to work from.  He cannot predict how the story will end, for the <i>real</i> story is the interaction between the GM and the Players.  And unlike characters in a play, the Players have much more freedom to influence the story; they may even bypass whole sections or add new events that the Gamemaster did not expect.</blockquote>\nI think that last one should be "unlike <i>actors</i> in a play", ahem.<br/><br/>Anyway, a few more paragraphs about this stuff and then: PRINCIPLES OF BEING A GM<br/><br/>They are:<br/><br/><b>Work Together</b> ("DC Heroes is an interactive game in which the GM and the players work together.  As the GM you should not attempt to have complete control of the game's flow.  If the players do not react according to your plans, so much the better. A story is not as much fun if you know exactly how it will end before it starts.")<br/><br/><b>Role Play And Encourage Others To Role Play</b> ("The Players should be encouraged to role play their characters Motivations...You are responsible for creating events that allow the Players to act out their characters' personalities.  If a character Upholds the Good, give that character the opportunity to do good deeds.  You can also put him in situations that will test his mettle, like choosing between two evils.")<br/><br/><b>Don't Kill The Characters</b> ("The sole object of the villain's plot should never be to kill the heroes.  Instead the villain will usually want the heroes out of the way so that he can commit his crime unhindered.  Or they may want to play with the Heroes or annoy them, like Mr. Mxyzptlk does to Superman.")<br/><br/><b>Plan Ahead</b>  ("Spend at least an hour and a half before the game starts, preferably before the Players arrive, reviewing your notes for the upcoming adventure.  Make sure any handouts and visual aids are prepared, including maps and diagrams, and that you have worked out the Attributes, Powers and Skills for all your major villains.  Keep the Gamemaster screen and lots of ten-sided dice handy.  The more you plan, the more smoothly the game will be." (sic)<br/><br/><b>Plan for the future</b> ("...if you only stay one week ahead of the game, the result will be a choppy adventure.")<br/><br/><b>Challenge the Players' Minds</b>  ("The DC Universe is very rich in possibilities for adventure.  The game is not a series of slugfests.  Challenge the minds and imaginations of the Players with clues and veiled information.")<br/><br/><b>Create a Stable Environment</b> ("The world of your heroes will expand as the  game goes on, but the basic outline should not change.  If the bank building was on the corner of Fourth and Elm yesterday, it should still be there today.  A stable environment helps create an imaginary world with which the Players' characters can deal.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438582/#Comment_438582" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-20T14:43:26+00:00" title="September 20, 2014  2:43PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the main thing I want to mention about this is how straight-up directive it is.
