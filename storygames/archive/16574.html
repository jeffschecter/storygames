They live in a mostly mythical land! <br/><br/>Each session, there\u2019s an adventure that comes calling! <br/><br/>Characters have three traits! These are their defining features. If you had to sum up the character in three points, that would be their traits. A good way to think of traits is like this: <br/><br/>One trait for the characters powers and abilities, how they deal with action! Maybe they\u2019re a warrior, or have stretchy powers, or they\u2019re a vampire. <br/><br/>One trait for their personality, how they approach things! Maybe they\u2019re sassy, maybe they\u2019re knowledgeable, or maybe they\u2019re clueless, but with a good heart! <br/><br/>One trait is for another notable thing about them! Maybe they always wear a hat or play the violin or whatever. This trait is special, because you change it every session if you keep the same character. It\u2019s not that they lose the traits they get rid of (well, maybe they do, maybe they don\u2019t), but they aren\u2019t the focus. <br/><br/>Play goes in a series of turns. The GM starts, by announcing the adventure. For example, all the candy in the land has vanished! Or a giant lizard is attacking the city! Or the princess wants someone to spy on her romantic rival before the dance because she suspects her of being evil! <br/><br/>On the player\u2019s turn, they say what they\u2019re doing to complete the adventure! They can totally make up details (and probably should)! For example, they go to the jail to talk to the robber they put in prison last month to see if he stole the kingdom\u2019s candy (or knows who did). Or maybe they just run up and start whacking on the giant lizard attacking the city with their sword! Or maybe they start following the princess\u2019s romantic rival around while she goes about her day. <br/><br/>In the description of what they do, they should say how they\u2019re using their traits. For each trait they use (up to two), they get +1 to their roll. Then they roll a d6: <br/><br/>1-3: Bad stuff happens! The GM tells you how things go bad! You are now in a bad situation. If bad stuff happens again, you will be out of commission until someone successfully helps you out. If you\u2019re out of commission, your turn is instead spent adding extra details to another character, and giving that character +1 to their roll. If everyone is out of commission, you all lose! Oh no! Next adventure, you\u2019ll have to make your way out of this mess! <br/>4-6: Complications! You decide what happened that made things more complicated than you thought! If you manage to incorporate how you\u2019re dealing with these new wrinkles next turn, add another +1 to your roll. If you ignore the new complications, -1 to your roll instead! <br/>7+: Mathematical! The GM decides how your action made progress towards victory! (You\u2019re encouraged to add suggestions!) Once you make progress towards victory twice per player, you all win! If you were rolling to help someone out, you succeed, and they are no longer in a bad situation instead of making progress towards victory. <br/>What kind of bad stuff, complications, and progress should be used depends on the genre and scope of the adventure. <br/><br/>If you\u2019re searching for candy thieves, a success is a good lead you\u2019re following well, a failure might be a red herring or a candy thief attack on you, and complications might be mysterious third parties or compelling clues. Victory comes when you catch the thieves and return the candy. Make sure the GM doesn\u2019t plan in advance which clue leads to the real solution- we won\u2019t know until the dice tell us! (If you do finish early, feel free to add on some tying up of loose ends, like finding an accomplice or that the stash found was only partly there).  <br/><br/>If you\u2019re fighting a giant lizard, a success is a solid hit on the lizard. A complication might be the lizard threatening some part of the city or you noticing a possible weakness, or maybe some other hero coming to help (who is maybe a jerk and might not help you at all!) Bad stuff could be the lizard smacking you a good one or breaking something important in the city. Success comes when you beat the lizard finally. <br/><br/>If you\u2019re spying on the princess\u2019s rival, success might be finding out something suspicious, a complication might be a strange possibility of what\u2019s going on, a third party, or her becoming suspicious of you. Failure might be her embarrassing you or leaving. Success would be finding out the truth.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Rule</span>: It all comes together! Once an adventure, a hero can use all three of their traits. <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Rul</span>e: Intense Danger! Once an adventure, the GM can automatically put a hero in a bad situation!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379355/#Comment_379355" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T17:08:23+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  5:08PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>The characters are heroes!
