The same publisher also has .45 Adventures for pulp, and a science fiction game etc.  When I went to Gen Con in 2006, there was somebody selling a very pretty translated French game that also seemed to be focused on skirmish minis + roleplaying (can't remember the name, it started with an R I think).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe games often include extensive sections on the issue of how to use minis, such as who provides what minis, how to paint them, how to build terrain, and the expected size of the play area.  These issues have been brought up as ones that D&amp;D4; *doesn't* address.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm curious to know if anybody on these forums has played games that fall into their category, and what their experiences have been.  How do you think they compare to what D&amp;D4; seems to be trying to accomplish?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148667/#Comment_148667" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T18:27:25+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  6:27PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Richard Johnson ( the Rattrap Games guy who makes .45 Adventure, Gloire and the other games you're talking about) has his background primarily in RPGs, and was a big 1e fan, if I remember things he has posted properly, so some of his approach to minis comes from that source more than traditional minis wargaming.<br><br>He has definitely though about the use of space ( a given scenario is generally meant to be played on a 2' x 2' or 3' x3' surface), and the presence or absence of a referee in his designs ( it's most often designed as a two player, no referee game. More players can play, but the referee is still mostly a scenario creator/game emcee/rules teacher-interpreter than a direct participant, and tends to be fairly extraneous). The game itself requires very few miniatures per player ( and plays best with very few per player), so there is some encouragement to pick up a set of preferred personal minis (2-5 total), then expend any other effort/time/cash on non-personal minis, including terrain/baddies/critters. Conveniently, makers of pulp skirmish minis tend to sell their minis in units of 3-5 ;-)<br><br>I haven't seen his character advancement rules yet, so I can't speak to that sort of campaign play. I do know that he has been known to put together several 2' x 2' "chapter" layouts on a single table, so that you can play linked games.<br><br>On a related rule, heroes ( even minor ones) can't actually die under the (pulp rules, although very minor characters and mooks can die. They can certainly be knocked out for a scenario, however. Mooks are relatively faceless and replaceable anyway, so that doesn't matter too much. Anyway, I suspect that this is both a reference to genre conventions and a practical way of dealing with a player putting time and work into a character miniature.<br/><br/>Legends of Araby (by Two Hour Warames), a Arabian fantasy minis skirmish game with campaign rules, has a slightly different take. If a main character should be killed under the rules, that character instead has a mysterious "death" and disappearance in-game. They re-appear after sveral months have passed at a favored hideout. It is up to the owning player to fill in the details storywise. In mechanical terms, each time this occurs, it reduces the maximum level of development of the character. It would be the old D&amp;D equivalent of taking a level loss immediately and also being capped at a maximum of say 20th level. If it happens again, you're capped at 15th level, and so on.<br/><br/>I believe most of Two Hour Wargames' skirmish games work similarly in this regard. They also talk in that book about running multiple players on a single table set up at the same time, with players rotating into and out of the role of the bad-guys individual scenarios alternately playing out small set pieces where their miniature is spotlighted. The game is also heavily "automated" ( with fairly heavy event charts used both in and out of the skirmishing), so a bit of random rolling could likely keep a group of players at it for an afternoon. There isn't a whole lot of discussion about who buys minis however, or some of the out-of-game logiostics/social issues. there is, however, a fairly limited collection of monster and opponent "types', matching with the wargamer tendency to re-use miniatures in multiple games in a afshion you wouldn't tend to re-use NPCs in a non-minis rpg.<br/><br/><br/>(more later)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148676/#Comment_148676" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T19:37:13+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  7:37PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rafial</cite>The games often include extensive sections on the issue of how to use minis, such as who provides what minis, how to paint them, how to build terrain, and the expected size of the play area.

It assumes that:<br/>1) you'll be using battlemaps or tiles sets they sell or ones created according to the guidelines in the DMG (this covers the "terrain").<br/>2) you'll be using their miniatures which are prepainted (this covers painting)<br/>3) you'll be running their modules with their maps/tiles (covers the space it takes up) and has a section in the DMG about map shifting and random dungeons growing too large and how to deal with that.<br/>4) the modules have instructions about unveiling the maps and placing the miniatures to start the encounter.<br/><br/>I'm just not seeing the "D&amp;D4E doesn't cover it" thing.<br/><br/>Furthermore, translation from imagination into a representation is nothing new.  I remember playing various RPGs mapless and then someone sketching things out.  It happened very fluidly.  Things would get drawn based on people's statements as it was all figured out.  "Placing" PCs was done by people pointing and going "This is that statue I was standing by" and "here's that curtain I'm hiding behind."  I don't think it's a lack of support for a certain style of play to rely on our natural skills of representation, communication and description.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148688/#Comment_148688" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T22:14:50+00:00" title="June  6, 2008 10:14PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I'm just not seeing the "D&amp;D4E; doesn't cover it" thing.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<b>M Eryesen</b>: Okay, I'll take that as granted, as I'm only echoing what others may or may not have said, I don't have the actual books yet.

Where we seem to disgaree is mainly where it comes to whether other rpgs have been as supportive of minis use. Me, I'd say no, they really haven't been. I think Matt would say they have been. In perspective, it's kind of minor.<br><br/>What I also see is a sort of meeting in the middle going on. With D&amp;D4e, there has been a bunch of thought put into minis use (IIUC-I'm still waiting on my copies, too!). Again, IIUC, it really looks in some ways as if WotC has thought more thoroughly about things that make minis use fun (dynamic environments, quirky and heroic abilities, multi-player gameplay) and easy ( pre-made terrain, prepaints, quick set-up, breakdown).<br/><br/>OTOH, these indie micro-skirmish games are coming from a minis gaming end, and have some advantages born from experience with table top play.<br/><br/>I noted it above, but they tend to have relatively survivable main chartacters, and generally a smallish list of opponent types.Where they give a more generalized Mook list, there are often very brief descriptions, which one then customizes to create more variety.<br/><br/>On the whole, they also tend to be paper lite. You won't see nearly as many reference sheets, cards, etc around a table. Partly this is because they tend to be mechanically simple, but partly this is also to increase the amount of usable space on a surface. It varies by game, however. Rattrap characters generally fit to a sheet of typing paper. 2HWcharacters, at least in Legends of Araby only have one stat (Reputation, rated 2-9) and a quick reference to armor and weapon. If you go WYSIWYG, you don't really need to write down anything for your character while at the table. Also, minis games tend towards refernce sheets for relevent rules, generally staying in the one double-dided sheet range, maximum.<br/><br/>Aside from Rattrap and 2HW, there are also the Games Workshop campaign skirmish games. While their fully developed off-shoots from Warhammer 40K (Necromunda, Gorkamorka) and WH Fantasy Battles (Mordheim) eventually went out of print*, lessons learned in the development and actual play of those games** lead to the developement of GW's (semi-)Historical Games series of warband scale games, <i>Legends of [Blank]</i>. Currently, Legends of the Old West and Legends of The High Seas are available, and there are rumors of a Prohibition Era version in the works.***<br/><br/>These games are interesting for a couple of reasons. First, the "gang", one's personal group of minis acts as a sort of hybrid creature, halfway between a CCG deck ( you collect it and build it as you see fit) and an RPG player character ( it develops, but only as a result of play, generally becoming stronger). Interestingly, unlike some early minis games, there is no "this is the player" miniature. The game itself is meant to be played competitively, generally with only two sides, and no referee. In terms of the expected level of competitiveness players exhibit, these games are about halfway between the Rattrap games and 2HW games ( gentlemen competitors with a fairly strong "cultural" emphasis on playing within genre voluntarily) and GW's main games ( often culturally too competitive for my tastes).<br/><br/>From previous experience, these games, when played in their campaign form, tend to encourage "blue booking" style out-of-game activities among their players. Having played one-offs of LotOW and LotHS and campaigns of Necromunda, I would say there is a very distinct difference. The full experience of the game really only comes out in some sort of campaign play ( no matter how loosely defined. At the simplest, it tends to be a bit like a very casual sporst league based entirely on pick up games), much like may rpgs. Aliso, much like early rpgs, story and characterization tend to be things that develeop as play goes along, rather than be the result of any front loading of relationships/rivalries/shared histories, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Necromunda and Mordheim are still available as free pdfs at the GW Specialist Games page, and I actually have seen a hardcover Necromunda Rulebook recently at the FLGS. I can't speak to the availability of Gorkamorka.<br/>**Along with the development of the LotR minis rules, which, in a sense were built on lessons of earlier games. Depending on your POV, the LotR rules were either streamlined for ease of use and teaching, or dumbed-down to appeal to the unwashed mouth-breathing masses.<br/>***GW also puts out other historical games through their offshoot, BL Publishing. Since those games tend more towards the traditional minis games with masses of troops and less characterization, I've skipped discussing them here.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148711/#Comment_148711" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T05:12:45+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  5:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/>The smaller stuff:<br/>In addition to those games, there are plenty of small company and freebie games. Ganesha Games has been getting attention for its Songs of Blades and Heroes/ Songs of Gold and Darkness (Fantasy+ Dungeon-delving expansion) and Mutants and Deathray Guns ( Gamma World/Kamandi/PotA style post apoc minis). Again, this is a very lightweight set of rules, and fairly generic. It is meant to be played head-to-head, and there is limited piece advancement and gang-building. The more recently developed Mutants version apparently has a very distinct campaign play that folks seem to either love or hate, being a somewhat linear progression, IIUC, of generalized events. On the positive side, Ganesha games rules are noted for being very game-y and not nearly so simmy as other rule sets, preferring to engage the player in the challenge rather than piddle around with micro-details.<br/><br/>Astounding Tales!<br/>This is, in effect, a lite, traditional rpg that just happens to be designed by a guy who loves minis. IT's fast'n'loose, and has a very traditional GM. It does take pulpy mentality into account in the rules, meaning that while it's possible for a main character to die, it ain't likely ( editing rules, special rules for heroes versus mooks, a rule requiring the Good Guys to win in the end or the GM _must_ plan a sequel game(s) as necessary). It's very traditional in the sense that the GM has a ton of ability to make calls on-the-fly, and rules are seen as an aid and toolkit for doing that better, not something that the GM is beholden to as holy writ. You can get this one through The Virtual Armchair General.<br/><br/>Adventures in Jimland<br/>A freebie jungle explorer type game, where players take turns playing either their intrepid band of Splorers or various natives and critters to opose another player's band. And by natives and critters, substutute in dinos, aliens, Deep Ones, killer apes, The French Foreign Legion, or whatever, as it suits your tastes. Much like the GW games, the explorer band takes up the place of the player character, and advancement is based around the events of the individual game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148713/#Comment_148713" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T05:50:02+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  5:50AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Cont)<br/>Comparing and contrasting D&amp;D4e minis play support with that of mentioned micro-skirmish games<br/><br/>Out of game questions<br/>GW, being a seller of miniatures, probably actually puts the most thought into this of anyone mentioned. GW's answer for its Legends series is essentially the same as its answer for its main games: Everyone needs to buy their own stuff. Generally speaking, stuff outside of "your own stuff" doesn't really exist. There is no particular benefit to purchasing or painting up anything that would generally be considered and NPC or wandering monster. Whatever terrain is created is left to individuals to make as they will, and the game can be played with relatively simple boards just fine.<br/><br/>GW rules have also become more geared to a 2' x 2' table or so ( notable by their weapon and movement ranges, as well as their scenario set ups, some of which decidedly <b>do not</b> work well on larger boards).<br/><br/>OTOH, in terms of advice, GW is right there with modelling and painting tips in full color. Give that GW doesn't actually make figures for their historical games ( to my knowledge), it's actually a nice bit extra to see.<br/><br/>Rattrap, Ganesha, 2HW and Howard Whitehouse's stuff all tends to be built more indie style and on indie budgets. While certainly there is advice on minis gaming or on rp'ing, much of this is expected to be stuff you either already know or can figure out on your own. Matt E. would undoubtedly be right at home with this stuff.<br/><br/>Where D&amp;D4e is showing real support is in a few key areas.<br/>Multiplayer: <br/>Depending on which of the games we're talking about above, there can be better or worse support for this.  <br/>      Least support&lt;---&gt;Most support<br/>Ganesha-2HW-Games Workshop-Rattrap-Jimland-Astounding Tales (effectively an rpg).<br/><br/>Everything I'm hearing about D&amp;D4e indicates that integrating multiple players was a key goal. There seems to be a real sense of teamwork options ( integrated in to the rules dealing with tabletop space) to a much higher degree than any of the skirmish minis games. I'd say that this is actually a huge advantage that this game has over them.<br/><br/>Dynamic environment<br/>Again, this is something I see much more with D&amp;D4e.Terrain in this game seems to do a llot more than simply slow down a mini's move or provide cover. Other minis games have experimented with these concepts, but it hasn't been really made central.<br/><br/>Maps and minis<br/>Premade and prepainted stuff is just an enormous boon all around. While experienced minis gamers tend to chuckle at the more simple paint jobs of this stuff or the flat 2-d maps ( as opposed to pretty 3-d terrain as god intended us to play with), the truth is most people don't have the skills of commited minis ghamers and have no urge to develop those skills or spend that money o that end of the hobby. Again, D&amp;D4e actually comes through on this point.<br/><br/>If you add in the synergy between the Collectible minis game and the rps ( and also between the relation of the primary buyers of the blind packs and the secondary market buyers of cheap individual minis for the rpg), ya really gotta think that WotC has a good thing going. Each of those two groups props the other up, and reasonably crosses over bweteen the two lines with some frequency.<br/><br/>The downside to this, of course, is that the use of premade maps and prepainted minis is that players don't necesarily ever end up with the DIY skills that other minis gamers have. Also, depending on how things work, it may be fairly hard to get some effects to play out right if you use the D&amp;D4e rules sans grid. Range is easy, 2&amp;3d space not so much, and pre-measuring will need to be accounted for ( often a severe Nono in other minis gaming).<br/><br/>The number of critters potentially encountered is also a downside for 4e. All editions of D&amp;D that I'm familiar with, have been really big on having a variety prey for PCs to go make extinct. In very basic terms, this means this means players will want a variety of minis. Naturally, substitution is possible, but at that point, you begin to move away from the minis fun, back down the road to fun sans minis.<br/><br/>So far, D&amp;D4e still seems to be working with a similar Dungeon as Monster Zoo/Hunting Preserve mentality as earlier versions of the game. There's just plain a huge variety of critters coming up in adventures. Compare that to a game based on Middle Earth, where there are effectively just a few different broad types of baddies ( orcs, bandits, Nazgul, wights, dragons, wolves, trolls, and the occasional unique SuperThreat like Shelob or the Balrog of Moria). I haven't yet seen anything indicating that WotC plans to sell sets of minis directly related to specific adventures or even campaigns that tend to cycle through mostly similar creatures.<br/><br/>This right here really is a downside for the D&amp;D vs. these other games which tend towards either having a much smaller scope, or are much more generic and DIY-oriented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148723/#Comment_148723" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T07:14:24+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  7:14AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2008 7:25AM by komradebob.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://nagssociety.com/resources/Jimland/Jimland.htm" rel="nofollow">Adventures in Jimland</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.thevirtualarmchairgeneral.com/" rel="nofollow">Astounding Tales! at TVAG</a>  and the <br/><a href="http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/astounding-tales/" rel="nofollow">AT!

It's fun levelling up your gang, buying new gear and the like, but the pain of losing guys and setbacks in the power progression really outweighs the fun.  The fact that each character in your gang represents a substantial investment of time and money in sculpting, painting, and so on, really compounds the problem.  It reminds me of the old "ante" rules in Magic: The Gathering.  While it was kind of fun to win cards off your friends, it was really terrible to lose important cards.  The result was a net loss of fun.  For me, over the long term, "develop your gang" games have a similar net product - not fun.<br/><br/>I think also a lot of these games have fallen into the same trap as D&amp;D3 did.  They're stuck halfway between being a fun tactical game, and being a simulation of a game-world.  That leads to a lot of superflous rules baggage in many games, in the interests of "realism".  I think it's something of a more important concern in these games though.  A lot of players of these games want to be able to apply universal tactical concepts ("concentrate fire", "divide and conquer", "stay in cover") to their play, no matter the game.  It's offputting for these players when tactics they feel should work in the real world don't work in the game.  I think D&amp;D4 has got away from the "tactical simulation" genre, trying to be a game that has its own tactics, its own rules of engagement.  That's cool, in my eyes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148909/#Comment_148909" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T20:43:29+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  8:43PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I think also a lot of these games have fallen into the same trap as D&amp;D3 did.

The other stuff lurks somewhere else. Rattrap only developed advancement rules after the first game or two had come out. Astounding Tales! has no particular advancement system.<br/><br/>I'm still waiting, not-patiently, to get a real look at D&amp;D4e in action. It really seems much more dynamic on the table top than most other minis games ( including ones I love quite a bit). By that, I just mean, for example theat in a more traditional minis game that comes out of a "units of men" mindset, a palm tree on a 3.5" base surrounded with lichen is maybe cover, maybe LOS blocking, maybe a movement slowing area.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D mentality coming from an  rpg mindset, seems much more. Like, hey, let's climb that tree, or knock it over, or animate it, or set it on fire, or swing from it, or...<br/><br/><i>Cooooool.</i><br/><br/>And yes, it definitely seems like it has its own feel, distinct from general purpose environment interaction.<br/><br/>Damn Amazon! Where are my books!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
