Your own doc says "If a skill is particularly important to you, consider getting an associated Aspect."  I think that a single number for each Attribute plus any associated Aspects will work very well.  If you want someone with a good Strength but a concentration in Athletics, then just buy an athletic Aspect.  <br/><br/>I think that you can get the converted characters to be good at similar things as they were before, without dividing the Skill Pools.  That would give you many fewer numbers on a character sheet but no loss of the characters you can express.  But that's really just a matter of taste -- I'd much rather have a character that's got "Strength +5" and "Track Star" rather than "Athletics +7; Wrestling +5; Might +4; Toughness +4".  \n<blockquote><br/>-- The<a href="http://hill-kleerup.org/pmwiki/FATE/FUDGEDice" rel="nofollow">Fudge Dice</a>are centered on zero so I think if you are adding some randomness they are a better fit than other dice.

I've played a significant amount of Spirit of the Century.  We found that the dice variation was a bit too large compared to the rather tight scale that the skills used.  We tried a few modifications, but weren't entirely happy with any of them.  The best of the lot was simply using 3dF rather than 4dF. Better yet would be to have "weak Fudge dice" that have 4 empty sides, 1 plus, and 1 minus, I think.  Running the numbers, rolling 5 of these dice would seem to be about right (but I'd have to have some and get the table feel to be sure).  <br/><br/>I hope that helps clarify the earlier post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362159/#Comment_362159" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T23:25:08+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 11:25PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/189rihoJpG9sAOfOeT-22X445RrfsRPdoB5lvFZK5I1Y/edit" rel="nofollow">newest version</a>.

That assumes everybody buys at least +1 Tier, but that seems pretty much like a given, how the mechanics work.  It might diverge from established fiction for a converted game, but for a game starting from scratch could work nicely.  <br/><br/>Also, you need to be clear on how Tier Advantages stack.  Otherwise, moving from <b>+3 Tier Advantage</b> to <b>+2 Tier Advantage plus Trump</b> will <i>cost no points </i> and gain you the Trump skill.  To me, that seems wrong.  If it was me, I'd say a maximum of +1 Tier Advantage from skills.  But that's me.  If stacking <b>is </b>what you want, I'd go ahead and add some text about how Tiers stack.  Otherwise, you're likely to find a pretty strong power differential between those players that figured it out and those who didn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362565/#Comment_362565" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T05:09:49+00:00" title="February 25, 2012  5:09AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2012 5:10AM by nikodemus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (nothing here, sorry)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362590/#Comment_362590" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T11:02:10+00:00" title="February 25, 2012 11:02AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do have notes for elder vs players how many Tiers they have ect. I've changed Tier to Ranks as it fits the ADRPG terminology I'm borrowing better. If I get them cleaned up I'd be glad to share but they are pretty barebones right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
