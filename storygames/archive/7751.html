Inspired by the adventures of Richard Sharpe and Matthew Hervey amongst others, you take the role of soldiers and officers, fighting their way across Portugal and Spain. Can you defeat the French Major who has sullied your honour? Will you succumb to the machinations of the wicked Sergeant? Will the heaving busom of Lady Haversham seduce you into betraying your brother? All these adventures and more are possible, with Duty &amp; Honour.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game features the Mission system which allows players to define their own objectives, set their own rewards and create meaningful relationships within the game. Missions, which can be military, personal or even romantic, shape the gameplay, the advancement of the characters and the direction of your campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read more about the game, check out some of the playtest APs and download game resources at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.omnihedron.co.uk/dutyandhonour" rel="nofollow">http://www.omnihedron.co.uk/dutyandhonour</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou can become a fan of Duty &amp; Honour on Facebook at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/Duty-Honour/27681967199" rel="nofollow">http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/Duty-Honour/27681967199</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe game was designed as part of Collective Endeavour and the game forums exist at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.collective-endeavour.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe game will also be supported by free .pdf releases of the Duty &amp; Honour Almanac providing new background material, NPCs and Missions for the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDuty &amp; Honour is a 128 page book, perfect bound 7.5 x9.7 inch b&amp;w; interior, colour cover<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be officially released at Furnace Convention in Sheffield, UK on Saturday October 18th 2008.

And: it is a military game where you can play characters of vastly differing rank and still have a fun time that doesn't devolve into "Corporal Jones, go do all the dirty work that I don't want to do while I just sit here and drink this rather fine claret!" "Bloody officers!" remarks Corporal Jones.<br><br>Also, just a over a year ago, Neil came up to the Play Collective booth at Gen Con, slightly concerned about discussing his games design in public. I don't think he need ever have worried. Through taking on board critique and advice, engaging in thorough playtesting and harbouring a desire to produce the best possible game he could, all the while staying true to his original vision of creating something that would give the action-packed feel of the Sharpe novels, Neil has produced an exceptionally fine first published game.<br><br>Now I just need to wait for the printed version to drop through my letterbox.<br><br>Cheers<br>Malcolm<br><br>*Not that I'm averse, you understand. But a time and a place for everything.<br>**Truly remarkable when you consider he's from Newcastle.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172024/#Comment_172024" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T00:27:42+00:00" title="September 30, 2008 12:27AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cheers Malc. So eloquent*<br/>\n<br/>\nIts been a long road bringing D&amp;H; to market. Its been an exceptionally steep learning curve in parts and an exercise in learning your own abilities and moreover, limitations. There have been some very funny moments and some sad ones mixed into the pot but at the end I am delighted that I knuckled down and got on with the job. The era and the style of gameplay that the book deals with are true passions of mine and I'm glad I can share them with everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've had massive support for the project from the guys at Collective Endeavour and from here on Story Games. They are two communities that really are open to new ideas and new people** and I count myself fortunate to have found them and become part of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil<br/>\n<br/>\n* For a Jock...<br/>\n** Except for Walmsley.
