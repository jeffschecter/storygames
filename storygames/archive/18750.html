The title was the selling point, but it's also takes less than two hour to play. The second place this year went to Mumins v\xe4rld (Moomin's World - a *World hack). At the convention that I attended to, the median age were 17 and it had a slight majority of girls, so have a diverse game menu.<br/><br/>The link below was our game menu offered by five game masters, and the games were sorted into how long it took to play them. (less than two hours, 2-4 hours, and 4-6 hours.)<br/><a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/Rollspelsrummet.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://erebaltor.se/rickard/Rollspelsrummet.pdf</a> (in Swedish)<br/><br/>What I feel is important is to always have someone there to greet and invite people. To ask them if they know what roleplaying games are, how long time they have at their disposal, and to pitch games. Possibly show the game menu or have all the game on a board so the visitors can read for themselves. It's sooo important to always have someone to greet people, otherwise they will just have a look and then disappear to never come back. Trust me, it's even better to force a game upon them and tell them that this is what they should play. I prefer to push the shorter games on them, and if they like the experience, tell them to come back for a longer game later. I also prefer pitching shorter games because .... well, you try investing six hours in something you don't know anything about. As I experienced it, it's only the ones who already played roleplaying games before that takes that bet.<br/><br/>To explain what roleplaying games are, just say it's storytelling where YOU are playing the main characters. That's enough.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420688/#Comment_420688" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-25T10:35:22+00:00" title="August 25, 2013 10:35AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Self promo: Bliss Stage, Clover, Hot Guys Making Out, Blossoms in Winter (write to me for a playtest doc).<br/><br/>Others: GxB, BxB, GxG, Yeld, Panty Explosion, Anima Prime, MAID, Golden Sky Stories, Tenra Bansho Zero, Double Cross, Magical Burst, OVA, Motobushido, Tulip Academy's Society For Dangerous Gentlemen, Hikikomori, Shoujo Diary, The Princess Game, Tears of a Machine.<br/><br/>It depends on what sort of crowd you expect.

Those are important, but the game choice is important as well; you need something versatile that doesn't require you to do careful triage on in-coming customers before offering them a spot at the table. Also, it's a big bonus if you don't need a 2-hour session: the ideal introductory game is constantly on-going, and players just drop in and out as they will.<br/><br/>I've been going to the anime convention Tracon every year for the last 7-8 years, mostly to propagate roleplaying among the teenagers. The game I designed with Sami Koponen, <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/fables-of-camelot/" rel="nofollow">Fables of Camelot</a>, came out of the practical needs of the demography and convention environment, so perhaps you'll find looking into that useful. I find that most games are too slow, or conceptually complex, or without simply appealing color, to work well as an introduction to the hobby. There are other fine titles that have virtues in this regard as well, of course.<br/><br/>One thing I might note is that practical experience doesn't really advocate being too up-front about how "anime" your game is. I mean, if it's just generically anime, then at least the Finnish anime conventioneers don't seem to be any more intrigued than they'd be about anything, other things being equivalent. And if you make your game specific to a IP (a <i>Naruto</i> scenario or whatever), then you're putting up barriers for the majority who aren't in that specific fandom or haven't seen that show.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it can't be said that the subject matter and style of treatment are arbitrary, either; my experience is that the games that do well are generally brightly-coloured and clear in concept. Look for something that is easy to understand conceptually. For example, the Arthurian set-up in <i>Fables of Camelot</i> works well in this regard because it's easy to imagine, and playing Arthurian knights has low barrier to success in thespianism (you can just talk stilted and chivalric, anybody can do that) and drama (there's a wide range in what a knight can be like, and players find it easy to express their choices). Games with subtle settings and complex characters don't do nearly as well.<br/><br/>To pinpoint another game that works well in the most important aspects (speed, convention-suitable social footprint, clear and simple to imagine), older editions of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> are very good for these conditions. I recommend a simple streamlined version with something like e.g. Mentzer as your base, and make it quick and lethal, yet challenging. Perhaps swap the character classes and races a bit if you feel the need, although I'd say that the current generation of teenagers is well-versed on all sorts of hobbitry, so I wouldn't find drastic changes that necessary.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420694/#Comment_420694" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-25T18:42:57+00:00" title="August 25, 2013  6:42PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doubt I'll have time but if I can I'll run Fairy Tale Assassin League.

Short games with a clear structure. InSpectres, G\xd7B, and Kagematsu are three good suggestions that fit that description. Another thing I would like to add is that the game should have a well known theme. Everybody knows Ghostbusters. Not that many has a clue about ronins in the 1500th century. That creates a high threshold from the start, even if it's an imagined one.<br/><br/>I wouldn't focus to much on the anime part either. For me, anime is anime, but that's like saying tabletop roleplaying games are like LARP and that there is not difference between them. Just because a game has manga pictures in it, doesn't mean it's automatically suited for playing at anime conventions.<br/><br/>Oh, and when you're done, tell them that they are welcome back to play more, because there are a lot of different experiences to gain from the diverse flora of roleplaying games. So when they come back, ask what game they played and pitch the different play experiences. That's more important IMHO than saying what the game is about. G\xd7B is about three dates where one player is trying to do the best they can when things starts to go wrong. In Kagematsu, you will play out the first moments of meeting another person. In InSpectres, you're going to experience something action filled and have your creativity challenged. You can tell something about the world, but that's a bonus rather than something required.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420712/#Comment_420712" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-26T08:59:44+00:00" title="August 26, 2013  8:59AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TBZ would be great, because you can get it to a running start right off the bat.

We often see more players for a game of a non-anime related thing than otherwise. When talking to con-goers, the general gist seems to be that sometimes a few days worth of anime, or knowing that a few days worth of solid anime is to come, can be burn out inducing. So we tend to bring a variety. I'd be wary of just bringing anime inspired games to an anime con.<br/>Second, quite a few folks will maybe be interested in RPGs but never played before. This is a very very common occurence at anime cons in my experience, where those who turn up know that these games exist and use odd dice, but actually have little knowledge beyond that. Thats cool and awesome. I often keep a D&amp;D adventure written somewhere in the back, the reason being it gets asked for quite a bit, especially by folks who think all RPGs are D&amp;D. With new folks, you can often scare them off by showing them all of the other games available, or hitting the information overload button. Its not the best for a con setting but once you have them hooked in you can run from there. <br/>Third, people seem to consume substantially more booze at anime cons than at gaming cons, from what I have seen. Due to that, simple games are best. FAE, Inspectres, Wushu and Maid are all great games that can be easily played when mental acuity is not high. On that note, Maid can be a really fun and very silly game that can keep everyone relaxed, but remember to keep a watchful eye on the table whilst doing running it at a con, as one player can easily tread into 'making others uncomfy' territory.<br/>Fiasco is always super easy, especially if you have more people who want to play than you have GMs/runners. Run around with a few playsets of as many different themes as you can think of (Find an anime one and a con one if you want, but keep them as two within a set of around 10) and just sit back and watch. Remember to keep your eye on how all the games are going down. Its easy to get enthralled in a very good one, but it means you aren't keeping an eye out for any stumbling blocks others could be coming up with in theirs.<br/>Microscope has proven to be a bit of an unexpected success with audiences which can really harness a lot of the creative energy in a room and bring people in who maybe aren't too interested in playing a character. I find it particularly successful with additional members of groups that have come along. If their friend wants to play some Fate etc., but they don't seem too keen, maybe guide them onto Microscope instead.<br/>Hot Guys Making Out is awesome, as is Sea Dracula. Both will go down a storm, especially if the former is done earlier during the day, before point three has had a chance to take effect. Clover is really good fun whenever, and can be whipped out at quick notice. I haven't had a chance to run Golden Sky Stories, but that is on my list to run at my next con in a few weeks.<br/>Finally, keep in mind your allied interests. Marvel Heroic hacks really well for a Super Sentai game, for example. There are a lot of more straight up Martial Arts movie and Samurai drama RPGs, too: Feng Shui still stands its ground as an amazing game that is great for conventions, for example.<br/><br/>(Also Rickard, Moomin World sounds like the best thing.

We played Kagematsu and the players were all spouting historical details and referencing ten different anime shows set in 16th century Japan, and I met several who didn't know what Ghostbusters was (due to beeing 14 years old).<br/><br/>For the rest, I agree. Dragons &amp; Bananas was popular because it was (1) short, (2) had a funny name, and (3) was light-hearted and goofy. The crowd on this con was younger and more into crazy non sequiturs than I was used to. They'd often be all "Oh! And Pikachu is there!". It took some effort to reign that in to keep the game from going overboard, and it helped to have sorta-crazy games like InSpectres and D&amp;B. Then again, Jonatan seemed to do a hell of a good job keeping the consistency of Moomin World with the phrase "That doesn't happen in the world of Moomin.".<br/><br/>I ran only one session of Prosopop\xe9e, but it was a really good one, probably my best so far. I think the "Spirited away" vibe works at an anime convention, and the whimsy fairy-tale world had the capacity of absorbing all kinds of weird stuff without breaking.<br/><br/>James: I think Moomin's World is only availible in Swedish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420735/#Comment_420735" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-26T22:15:49+00:00" title="August 26, 2013 10:15PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't condescend to anime fans.
