I am pretty happy with the game, especially as far as "200 word" games go. I have received some good feedback and would like to expand and tweak some things. <br/> <br/>The game is a collaborative monster creator, with some boardgamey mechanics on top. Instead of writing about it, I will just post it here as it is only 200 words.<br/><br/>-------------<br/><b>Liber Monstri</b><br/><br/>You are scholars writing a guide to monsters. You have travelled for months collecting rumors about different beasts. Now, you meet again to write up your findings. <br/><br/>Rumors: on scraps of paper write monster aspects: looks, abilities, origins, weakness, etc. Combined, all players should have at least 30 rumors. Mix them into single pile.<br/><br/>On your turn draw a rumor. Narrate it, recount the tale of the person who encountered the monster. Put the rumor in the center of the table. Play continues clockwise.<br/><br/>All new information should build on what is already established. Contradicting information needs to explained. Other players vote, majority wins. If vote is against you, the monster is proven not real. Discard all the current rumors. Next player starts a new monster. <br/><br/>After narrating you can declare the monster complete by naming it. Collect all the current rumors and put them in front of you. Next player starts a new monster.<br/><br/>After the rumor pile is empty, roll a d10 for each  monster in front of you. Roll equal or lower than the number of rumors in this monster to score a point. Most points wins.<br/><br/>Feel free to write down and share your creations. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23LiberMonstri&amp;Mode=like">#LiberMonstri</a><br/>------------<br/><br/>I see this game both as a story game and a tool used for creating monsters for your traditional campaign. This is why I included the hashtag at the end, in the future I would like to collect the best of those creations from around the web and release an omnibus of them for free, so people can add some new creatures into their games. <br/><br/>As I see it now, the game's main target are traditional roleplayers. A kinda sneaky way of introducing story games to this crowd. This is why the scoring mechanics exist. It is a bit of a failsafe for two reasons: 1). establishes points to help traditional players decide when a monster is "finished" (I think story gamers wouldn't have a problem with that) and 2). establishes randomized/percentage based scoring to prevent very gamey gamers from taking any monsters whenever they can, thus spoiling the game for everybody else. I know that the randomized scoring is not very neat (especially among the board gaming crowd), but it is a narrative game first and foremost, so I am not worried much about that.<br/><br/>Saying that, I am not very keen on this scoring, or any score keeping for that matter, but this is the best solution I could come up with in few words. What else can I do to win over traditional rolplayers to give it a try?<br/><br/>For the expanded version I want to explain the rules better (examples would be a must) and I am thinking about adding couple different tables of monster rumors/aspects (probably by genre - fantasy, sci-fi, cthulhu, some more classic demons etc.)<br/><br/>I would like to know what you think about the game? Are the rules understandable to you guys? What would you change (scoring/end game advice would be most appreciated)? Would you rather have the game with a theme (I am thinking monks in a dark fantasy/s&amp;s world after a cataclysm that spawned many new monsters) or be like it is now, genre neutral?<br/><br/>At this point I am looking for any advice/brainstorm. After couple "playtests" (and I am using this term very loosely) I found the game to be actually quite fun, especially for creating Conan/Cthulhu inspired monsters and would really want to finally take one of those small games I designed for challenges and make it into a fully fledged thing.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452254/#Comment_452254" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T05:18:43+00:00" title="April 18, 2016  5:18AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds very interesting. I don't really see the point of your explanatory text - I'm not sure trying to "trick" any kind of gamer is really conducive to good game design - but I like the game itself very much. (Including the scoring, although I'm not sure it's enough of an incentive not to finish monsters "early". And perhaps it makes "starting" a monster somewhat unappealing, points-wise.)<br/><br/>One thing strikes me:<br/><br/>Since each player draws a rumour and then describes the monster, it means that monster creation is fully random. I would prefer to see some triage happening in there; some player-decision-making. For instance, have each player draw *two* rumours, and then pick one to use, placing the other one back in the rumour "deck". This way we can avoid some of the weirder/uninspiring combinations, and "edit" some of the monsters in specific directions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek" title="Level27Geek"><img alt="Level27Geek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/801/nFHCBYUL6HZMO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek">Level27Geek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452255/#Comment_452255" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T13:19:44+00:00" title="April 18, 2016  1:19PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Paul!<br/><br/>I should have used different wording for "trick." It's more on selling the traditional roleplayers on story games. Currently I live in a small-ish town, where roleplayers are scarce and storygames pretty much unheard of, and those who heard of it, think story games are only reserved for high-brow, almost artsy-fartsy gaming. So that's the the background for my reasoning for the game.<br/><br/>Anyway. <br/>I like the idea of drawing 2 rumors. It will limit the "push-your-luck" aspect; you will almost never be forced by a rumor to create contradicting information. Only player's own forgetfulness will create contradictions. I think it is not a bad thing, it will make for a better game overall. I might keep a draw1/play1 rumor as an option - maybe for cthulhu like creatures?<br/><br/>I am glad you like the scoring. I am toying with expanding the benefits of scoring to make it more interesting. What if instead of scraps of paper, you would use index cards/blank cards to make a deck. At the end of the game the current rumors are thrown away. But each player can save one card for each point they get? This would build a basic deck of rumors perhaps? I am not sure, I am just spitballing here and stealing this mechanic from "one thousand blank cards"<br/><br/>I am curious why do you think the scoring as it is now won't prevent from completing a monster "early"? If you grab a monster with 2 or 3 rumors, you only have 20-30% chance of scoring that monster. I would think that would stop people from farming monsters for points. <br/>I think making the same player who finished a monster (or discarded one for creating contradicting information) would start the new monster. Maybe this would make it more of an incentive not to just score a monster whenever you can?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452262/#Comment_452262" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T18:20:32+00:00" title="April 18, 2016  6:20PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard for to imagine exactly what the "monster finishing" dynamics are like at the table, but in my imagination I would like to give some kind of benefit to collaboration/agreement. Perhaps when a player announces a monster "finished" other players have the option of agreeing that the monster is finished: if they do not, the monster must continue "growing". But if they do, they get to roll an extra die at the end of the game.

Sure, you only have a 20-30% chance of scoring a 2-3 rumor monster. But your alternative is 0% instead and the next player gets 30-40%. Pretty bad move! Turns go "try to add 10% of a point to the global pool, then decide whether to take all the points from the global pool". Well... I decide that yes, I will take the points instead of not take them.<br/><br/>Similar problem for voting NO currently... you have a scoring system which incentivizes players to always vote NO. Why would they vote YES and give someone else points?<br/><br/>You need some points-reason for a player to pass a monster, and you need some points-reason for a player to vote YES on a monster, or else your points are just sitting there providing perverse incentives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452268/#Comment_452268" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T21:37:40+00:00" title="April 18, 2016  9:37PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Yes, more or less my thinking on this point.

When she passes a monster with R rumors, she takes R/2 round up monster tokens.<br/><br/>When voting, the player to the right of the active player first secretly decides YES or NO, then the N-2 other players vote YES or NO. Anyone who agreed with the secret decision gets a voting token of a type which will be associated with the secret decider - always get that type when that person decides. If a majority of non-deciders vote NO, the monster is imaginary etc.<br/><br/>When a player takes a turn, she first secretly decides whether she will try to complete the monster (write it down!), then takes a rumor, narrates, vote happens. Then reveal whether you tried to complete.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, determine N partial winners, and whoever wins the most times, wins for real. There is a partial winner for each player - add up your monster tokens and voting tokens of that person's color, whoever has the most is the partial winner.<br/><br/>Tell the secret decider to decide for realz, no metagame, and note that their decision either way doesn't hurt their chances of winning!

If you fail, discard the monster and take Hipster tokens equal to the number of NO votes.<br/><br/>When you complete a monster, you may choose to trade Hipster tokens equal to twice the monster's rumor count for Monster tokens equal to 1 less than the monster's rumor count.<br/><br/>When you vote, if you vote YES and succeed, take 1 Hipster token. If you vote NO and succeed, discard 1 Hipster token. If you vote to complete a contradictory monster or vote to falsify a perfectly coherent monster because of Points and Winning, feel sad.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, get 1 point for each Monster token and each monster you have. Tiebreak on Hipster tokens. Tiebreak on largest monster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452571/#Comment_452571" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T20:43:28+00:00" title="April 23, 2016  8:43PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh!

I'd recommend you try it.<br/><br/>As for finishing the monsters, how about a ritual phrase?<br/><br/>"Friends, have we learned enough about this Beast to dare facing it in battle, or does someone have more to say?"<br/><br/>That would work by consensus. <br/><br/>If you'd rather have it semi-random, or to force people's hands, it could work like this:<br/><br/>You roll a die to determine when a monster is done. Once a player declares a monster "complete", they roll a die. If one of the numbers assigned to the monster is rolled, that player gets a point and the monster is "done". If the die rolls a number not yet assigned to the monster, then the monster stays on the table.<br/><br/>For example, if the Echidna is marked 1,3,4,6,9, and a player says it's done, she rolls a die. On a 2,5,7,8, or 10, the monster stays and the next player adds another rumour.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek" title="Level27Geek"><img alt="Level27Geek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/801/nFHCBYUL6HZMO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek">Level27Geek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452726/#Comment_452726" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T20:54:06+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  8:54PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2016 9:49PM by Level27Geek.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a ritual phrase is the way to go with finishing the monsters. I couldn't come up with anything better than a "push-your-luck" mechanic. When tested, it turned out to be just much more game-y, and less narrative. People just concentrated on playing a rumor that can let them continue/end the monster, instead of narrating. <br/><br/>The small playtest I run, also showed that having a theme or a world makes the game flow much better. So it will be a part of it.<br/><br/>We have also played with and without scoring. We have used the system <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> made with writing a number and a initial on the card as it is played. I feel that the scoring didn't add much to the game, but slowed it down a bit.<br/><br/>I will experiment a bit with different approaches, but as of now, I think a purely narrative version would work. Scoring might be an addon. <br/><b><br/>Edit with an idea:</b> Maybe change the game flow a bit? One player starts a monster by playing a rumor and narrating. Once this player has finished he can pass the play to the next player OR declare the monster finished. Then, any other player can declare that they think they have more information about it. They roll. If it is above the current rumor count, they can take over this monster and add to it. If the roll is below or equal to the current rumor count, they take a wound?<br/><br/>A wound is something a user on bgdf mentioned. The player character got wounded during the encounter and lost an eye, arm etc. Now they need to include that wound in future narration?<br/><br/>Another option would be to lose a rumor from hand (making this player not able to add a rumor everytime a monster comes to them) or some other mechanical drawback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452782/#Comment_452782" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T17:09:27+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  5:09PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, when you have a game that's about creativity, scoring systems don't grip people too much - they can feel like a distraction. So it's best to keep them simple, and then only include them in the game if they help with some other aspect of the game (e.g. pacing, spotlight, focus, or something else).<br/><br/>I like the idea of adding character wounds or limiting a player's ability to add rumours - those are interesting!<br/><br/>Limiting the genre/scope of the game is always a plus. You could do it freeform, or by rolling or choosing from lists of options. Generally, however, limitations breed creativity, so it will only help the game. Your main problem here is dealing with the 200-word limit!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek" title="Level27Geek"><img alt="Level27Geek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/801/nFHCBYUL6HZMO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek">Level27Geek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452785/#Comment_452785" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T17:13:56+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  5:13PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I am planning on making fully fledged pdf out of this 200word version.

If player A wants to stop player B they have to give them a trait card. If Player B can't incorporate the trait the monster is done. This could cause some fun monsters to be created and stop random votes. <br/><br/>Of course, this means that that all players will need to start with a hand of cards to play. Maybe every player has 5 cards that they can either use them to build monsters or to vote with. You could even go so far and say that a player can only make 5 monsters. So they have to be careful about when to vote against the other players.<br/><br/>-----<br/>Change it to a bragging competition between a bunch of explorers telling "fish" they got away from stories. Each of them has faced, the most terrifying monster imaginable. Then they go around trying to build the most horrifying monster from the traits.<br/><br/>I also like the dice roll mechanic mentioned before. They could play a trait and describe it. Then they make a roll. if it is the number of traits or more they can play another trait. If it is lower then the monster must be named and the player tells how they just got away. Play continues with the next player.<br/><br/>Every player has a number of dice. One for each player. You can play them against another player to make them roll and stop their monster from growing. They then add the die to their pool to use against other players. <br/><br/>It adds some strategy about when to play the dice or when to horde them. Everyone can tell a fun tale and it turns voting into a clear act that has a cost.<br/><br/>This is off the top of my head so I'm not sure if a single player can cheese his way into getting all the dice and make a massive all trait monster.<br/><br/>Play continues until all cards are gone.<br/><br/>The person with the biggest monster wins. On ties compare both players next biggest monsters going down till you find the winner. If you still have a tie. count who has the most dice... okay I'm sure there must be a more fun way of solving ties but there you go. Two more ideas to play with. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452810/#Comment_452810" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-30T07:59:31+00:00" title="April 30, 2016  7:59AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another way to go, if you change the theme, is to write effects (20 or so) caused by the monster: white hair, lost a child, impaired hearing. One participant takes the role of a scholar, and the rest are villagers that draws one effect each. The scholar then interviews the villagers to hear their story, and can choose 1-2 follow up questions from a list.<br/><br/>The scholar then summarize the monster, decide at most one story that is fake, eventually adds some facts by its own (if the monster is known), and gives the monster a name.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The bad thing is that once a villager is done telling the story, then that participant is done contributing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454413/#Comment_454413" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T16:29:05+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  4:29PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2016 4:30PM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OMG now this, this one is gold!!!
