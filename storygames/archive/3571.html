For those of you who don't own or know about it, it's a massive campaign dealing with over 80 years of the Arthurian legend.  It is simultaneously an impressive, intimidating, and frustrating text.<br/><br/>By it's nature it is fundamentally telling "someone else's story" - something that's I think is generally regarded as less rewarding for players.  A lot of story game advice is about making the players important or making the story revolve around them.  Now, the book has brief advice on how to do this (e.g. let the story change in response to player actions but preserve the main events if possible) and the expectation is that players go in with their eyes open and are willing to play in the "Arthur" sandbox and not feel cheated.  Player characters grow in importance, sometimes assisting the main protagonists of the legend and sometimes having their own adventurers either directly involved in, or peripheral, to the main events.<br/><br/>But at the same time there are dozens of cases where, for a given year, the main adventure consists of the players being witness to an important event.  Admittedly one can fill in details around this event with roleplaying, NPC interaction, and sideplots.  But the main event is described as occurring with no input from the players and frequently with no option for them to have any influence on it - they are fundamentally bystanders to an NPC's action or NPC to NPC interaction. (Example: Players join an army to fight a rogue noble; the two armies draw together in a standoff; everyone witnesses the two leaders reconciling with each other; everyone goes home).  As a GM this frustrates me and as a player it would probably be infuriating.<br/><br/>So I'm interested in suggestions as to how one can preserve the main elements of the Arthurian tale and still give the players license to being involved, be important, and not hold back.  Should I just ditch any hope of holding to the legend once the players get involved?  Should I re-engineer these "witness only" events to be player driven and susceptible to change?  Should I just gloss over the details of the "legend" such that it become a sort of background bass-beat to the player's own struggles and adventures (e.g. you hear a rumor that, while you were hunting the knight who killed your brother, someone drew the High King's sword from the stone).  Or am I better off seeking to help players embrace this "participatory mode" so as to play to the strengths of the campaign and not try to make the campaign into something it is not?<br/><br/>Thoughts or personal [experience with /reactions to] the text appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80450/#Comment_80450" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T15:12:15+00:00" title="July 10, 2007  3:12PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're deep in the midst of TGPC and I really recognise some of the issues that you have highlighted here. In the earlier sessions one of the other players suggested that it was like playing in a documentary rather than a roleplaying game. We have thrown that issue off and I'll try to detail a little of what we have done.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We very much made our own story within the story - four knights to be married to four faerie sisters - one refuses and the spurned bride becomes the recurring villainess. We've also had a lot of player input into the storylines that happen alongside the campaign narrative - the two that spring to mind are the corruption and redemption of a Christian knight and a saxon blood feud against my knight which ended in epic revenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The game itself, especially in the Anarchy period REALLY hands the reins of the campaign over to the players to do with that they will. They are effectively in charge of Sarum over that period and it's a great period. By the time the sword in the stone happens, the players are really powerful and influential with some really quite high Glory scores. I believe in our campaign, for example, my character was counted as one of the knights 'that could be king' (if I wasn't Irish...) So sure, they can choose to be off hunting when Arthur pulls the sword and get to deal with the upshot of that later (because it will come onto them eventually) but I have to say, I cannot understand why a knight of power and influence wouldn't be trying to get the nod as the High King at the tournament!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n- I think there is a lot of flexibility within the myth for the PCs to have a real impact, especially as they gain more power. My character (with a ridiculously high Love (Family)) has managed to have a magically induced tryst with a teenage Morgan Le Fey and I believe that I may have spawned an illegitimate son who will turn out to be some distant relation to Arthur and I know thats going to come back and bite my son on the ass. Wholly plays about with the legend, but what the hell. Similarly we have annexed Winchester as one of our castles - and guess where Camelot ends up? We reckon Arthur is going to have pay ground rent. Hell, by the time Arthur gets his ass on the throne, your first characters will be under the pain of the aging tables but they will be very potent and thus you can take your place as the leaders of his armies and really have input and influence.<br/>\n<br/>\n- One of the best parts of the game we have found is the concept of a Squires adventure, featuring our sons at the ages of 16/17. Theres TONS of story potential in amongst all of that as the sons riff off the rivalries of their parents and try to live within or escape the shadows. And the actions of the sons tend to reflect on the fathers as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne final point - this is the Great Pendragon Campaign and I think there has to be some concessions to the legend or else you might as well be playing Chivalry and Sorcery. The book provides a GM with a magnificent resource to lay their campaign on top of, with a feeling to true desperation and excitement at certain parts. The only way I can describe it is that I *know* that when the time comes, my character is going to be kneeling in the water, pledging his allegience to the Boy King as the Warlord of Sarum and Lord of Donnington, as he did with Uther when he was just a shieldbearer, and that he will lead Arthurs left wing into battle against Lot. And I know I am going to make that session MINE.  Sure, it's 'someone elses story' but I get to mark MY brand and MY style on that story and make it MY story insodoing. Thats why I absolutely LOVE the campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope my passionate fanboy geekdom helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20O%27Rourke" title="Ian O'Rourke"><img alt="Ian O'Rourke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20O%27Rourke">Ian O'Rourke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80464/#Comment_80464" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T15:57:53+00:00" title="July 10, 2007  3:57PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2007 4:33PM by Ian O'Rourke.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should probably chime in here since I was the player who sort of compared it to playing in a documentary, or to some extent the drama series Rome.<br><br>I would agree with all of the above, I would also add the following: even when you play witness to great events they are great events that can cause great drama and story within the group of knights you are playing. We are in the 'might is right' period, which has caused our Knights some problems (mine is the Christian Knight that has gone through a redemptive story - largely through events hes been involved in and failed passions rolls - against the odds). As an example, we are continually pulled into events that earn us much glory, but little true honour - and this has been a theme through the game as our knights deal with this issue. We sacked a Frankish city, being major players in taking the gate, only to find it was a ploy to take their stuff. We took part in the major battles along with Uther against Gorloise, despite the fact the man had done little wrong beyond protect his wife, something we ourselves would have done. We killed him, performing the killing blows.<br><br>Basically, even when you are the minows, the point is to play characters swept up by the decisions of such titanic men ruled by their passions and it can work, and as the above post says, when Uther dies you find youself effectively running Sarum, and in that role we've been making povitol decisions on the future of hundred of people, and choosing who to make pacts with and who not.<br><br>I think it soon becomes a case of feeling like you're a main character because your making pivotal decisions, and during the time you're not that pivotal, there is much drama to be had in dealing with the issues raised by the events you are drawn into.<br><br>Further reading can be found here for those who are bothered: <a href="http://www.fandomlife.net/fln/blogs.cfm?kwd=4" rel="nofollow">Pendragon Campaign Actual play</a>. I'm a big story games (even if we spend most of our time moving towards that model with traditional games), author stance sort of player, and it too me a while to adjust, but now I'm it's biggest fan, I'd even say I've gone beyond adjusting and now realise their is mileage we can get from it that we don't fully utilise.  It's a game for mature adults, really willing to address <a href="http://www.fandomlife.net/fln/blog.cfm?ID=747" rel="nofollow">the mature and deep themes present</a>.<br><br>The best example I can think of is this: if you're playing in a World War II campaign, do you have to each play one of the major generals? Or is there still lots of potential in terms of 'story game' in being a character suffering the consequences of the period (from a dramatic, not entirely sim perspective) and having a lot of influence in your own sphere?<br><br>Through all this *never* forget the influence of the passions.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert" title="jbuchert"><img alt="jbuchert" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert">jbuchert</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83127/#Comment_83127" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T05:45:07+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  5:45AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2007 5:45AM by jbuchert.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been recently thinking about how to, well, storify (for lack of a better term) the Great Pendragon Campaign as well. I agree that the focus should be on the characters' own trials and tribulations more rather than on participating in the "historical" events which should occur only when it is relevant to what is happening with the characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also been thinking about the game in light of a premise, in the narrativist sense of the word. I think you could do something with <i>"Is man in control of his destiny, or even his own self?"</i> With the Trait/Passion mechanics and the Christian themes (predestination is even one of the dividing issues between the Roman and British churches), I think the system is there to actually handle that premise.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoachim Buchert                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
