Or, to put it another way, are tactical games Homo Australopithecus, storygames Homo Erectus, and Nordic larp Homo Sapiens?

A supplementary would be, if tactical games are cinema, storygames TV, and Nordic larp home box office, why do people still go to the cinema, watch TV and go to the theatre (which, under this analogy, might be represented by wargames)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441879/#Comment_441879" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T16:49:50+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  4:49PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah no.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441881/#Comment_441881" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T17:24:29+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  5:24PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Too linear; too generalized.

It's psychologically compelling to do, but I personally hope that we have, as a civilization, ridden that particular carousel enough times to be at least a little bit careful about narratives of inevitably progressing sophistication <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>A big, fat fact illustrates how far this idea of progress from trad -&gt; prog -&gt; freeform could not possibly be the truth of the matter: Nordic freeform developed practically independently of Forgite developments through the decade starting around '95, <i>simultaneously</i> with the developments that led to the Forge and the follow-up diaspora. The people most responsible for developing the techniques, themes and artistic attitudes of Nordic freeform and larp were practically ignorant of story game development in the Anglosphere at the time. I call this a "fact" because I pretty much lived through those years and saw Nordic freeform take shape from reasonably close, so I'm relatively confident in my characterization.<br/><br/>So a relationship of cultural influence is at least right out, as far as I'm concerned, on the basis of simple facts on the ground. That leaves the various other analogies... like, maybe there's a Hegelian tendency towards perfected freeform synthesis in rpg culture, and Nordics are just smarter and thus figured out where roleplaying is going first? It would be interesting if somebody thought this way, but I certainly don't myself <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>For what it's worth, I myself tend to divide the young history of rpgs into four rough "traditions", not three: the transformation of early wargame-ish "old school" gaming lost living lines of influence in the birth of the "traditional" style of roleplaying to such an extent that I find it questionable to lump the two together under one heading. I generally consider the four major traditions of tabletop roleplaying to be old school, traditional, progressive and freeform.<br/><br/>(I should note that some people whose thinking on rpg history I respect quite a bit disagree with me thoroughly about the very existence of separate traditions in roleplaying. The main reason for why I hold to this opinion is that I constantly meet roleplayers for whom it is a very vivid reality of experience: they think and play in terms of a tradition of influences, and generally those influences are recognizably part of one of these traditions. That's easy enough to ignore if your own experiences differ.)<br/><br/>Between these traditions, if I had to characterize their nature as historical cultural movements, I would definitely not elevate any as more developed than the rest; rather, it's pretty obvious to me that the very disruptions of influence that lead from one to the other were symptoms of thorough creative dissatisfaction with the existing paradigm of the time. Thus e.g. the progressive tradition/community exemplified by the Forge came to be due to frustration with the perceived monolithic vagueness of the trad game as it had developed over the prior decade; the people involved in the new community wanted things that a GM-controlled "something for everybody" commercially-oriented game could not provide, and thus developed analytical and procedural clarity of systems that would move away from GM control and towards consciously coherent play. Meanwhile Nordics reacted to similar frustrations in nearly opposite way, by discarding the rules texts and reifying the auteur-GM to empower them in providing play with structure and meaning with little but bare social communication as their means.<br/><br/>(If you feel like nitpicking this extremely short version of the history, please don't. I'm just providing a snapshot of my own understanding to illustrate why I think the way I do about the relationships of these traditions. We can discuss the True and Factual Cultural History of RPGS in some thread dedicated to it if you want to.)<br/><br/>The point I'm trying to put across is that as far as I understand it, these traditions only exist because they provided different compelling answers to needs perceived at the time when the people involved discarded old answers and came up with new ones. They're not sublimely sophisticated replacements for the prior tradition, but merely reactions to how the prior group-think failed to serve particular creative needs. The old ways do not disappear ahead of the new because the new is not superior, but merely different; the people whose needs were well served by the existing tradition continue to play in their preferred way, while those dissatisfied or curious continue developing new schools of though.<br/><br/>I guess if I had to pick an analogue for the relationship between the rpg traditions, I'd go with a branching tree: sometimes branches separate from the trunk (like trad style separated from old school, and proge and freeform separated from trad), but they all continue growing independent of one another, and only time will tell which one is more vivacious or whatever. I don't know, maybe we'll see after another 10 years that one or more of these four "traditions" I named there gets subsumed by another one, or dies out for lack of creative vitality. Such things occur in cultural history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441916/#Comment_441916" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T22:37:42+00:00" title="January 22, 2015 10:37PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Golden Age of games is long past and now we, the diseased remnants, stumble through the garbage dump of a blasted worlds chewing on rusty pieces of metal until we are infected and die.

However, while the progression might not be linear there is IMO definitely a progression. The reason I chose <i>solid&gt;liquid&gt;gas</i> as the main analogy was partly click-bait of course, but the overall metaphor is that of the application of heat, where heat equals continuous development. If you take the wargames/early RPGs of the 60s/'70s (although roleplaying in one form or another has been around for centuries- Chess being arguably the first wargame using minis- I think it helpful to take commercially published games such as Chainmail and D&amp;D as the starting point for my hypothesis), all subsequent RPGs (including Nordic larp) can be IMO in some way traced back to these games. I certainly think that if it weren\u2019t for D&amp;D I wouldn\u2019t be designing my weird hippy games today. <br/><br/>Now, Nordic larp might have begun in the mid-\u201890s (I didn\u2019t know that, I thought it was more recent), so cannot be said to be a development of modern storygames- although they are strikingly similar, so much so that a thesis that says that the one is a development of the other would be, if one wasn\u2019t apprised of all the facts, entirely reasonable IMO- BUT, looked at in the overall development of RPGs, can be said to represent separate branches of it, which ultimately have the same root (i.e. Chainmail/D&amp;D). \n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>In other words, are the three types of games I mention part of an overall development and refining of RPGs, where the one evolves into the other until we reach a point where we can't go much further?</blockquote>\nI think this is the core of what you're talking about, right? What makes you think this might be true?<br/></blockquote>\nYes! So, what do I think is this underlying process of development I\u2019m trying to tease out? Well, I think there are two elements: first, a general refinement and streamlining, and secondly a ditching of some of the aspects of the previous iteration of the form. I mentioned <i>theatre&gt;cinema&gt;TV</i> as a good example of an art form that has been streamlined over the years. Theatre is a live performance you have to go to in order to see; with cinema you still have to go out to experience it, but it\u2019s pre-recorded, and thus has ditched the \u2018live\u2019 element; TV has refined the form even further by reducing the size of the screen and taking advantage of broadcasting technology to come up with an iteration that you don\u2019t have to step out of your house in order to experience. (In addition, you can look at the process fractally: TV itself has undergone further development, with DVDs, writable hard drives and the integration of transmission and computer technology leading to the consumer not now having to experience the form co-terminously with its transmission).  <br/><br/>How does all this relate to RPGs? Ok, in very broad terms, we started with games where you have a table, possibly a playing mat, certainly dice, a GM screen and figures representing the PCs. Oh, and a GM. A bit later White Wolf (Neanderthal?) comes along with all of the above except the battlemat and the minis, but with the refinement that the <i>story</i> is (almost) as important as the characters. This turns out to be a bit of a distraction, and the lineage doesn\u2019t develop much further. Then storygames come along, saying you don\u2019t need battlemats, or minis, or even (sharp intake of breath) dice!!  The refinement is that the GM becomes a facilitator (the <i>fractal</i> development being that this same facilitator becomes a rotating GM, or multiple GMs etc., and that dice are gone but are replaced with cards and other forms of resolution mechanic, and ultimately collaborative conflict resolution). Then Larps come along and the table (and eventually the room and even the building itself!)  is ditched. Meanwhile, on a separate track, freeform stays in the warm, cosy building but, like larp, ditches the table.<br/><br/>I now think that, while the tree analogy makes the most sense as a schematic, the <i>theatre&gt;cinema&gt;TV/home box office&gt;</i> analogy best represents our actual experiencing of RPGs as a form. Better than <i>solid&gt;liquid&gt;gas</i> because it\u2019s not linear, and better than the human ancestral tree because, unlike our ancestors, all the various iterations of RPGs are still with us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441973/#Comment_441973" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-24T18:43:17+00:00" title="January 24, 2015  6:43PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, so the part that doesn't work for me in this scheme is that you seem to be focusing on some pretty superficial, even arbitrary, traits of these playstyles to arrive to the conclusion that reduction of external tools is a constant of development in the rpg scene. To think this way we have to actively ignore all the countervailing evidence. It's an interesting idea insofar as it might give inspiration for some game design or whatnot, but I don't think it's very solid as an explanation of the historical development of rpgs.<br/><br/>For example, consider that the progressive tradition (what is commonly called story games or Forge games or indie games - all are inexact as cultural history terms, whence my coining an alternative name for it) actually features <i>more</i> concern for rules, dice, tools and defined roles than the prior traditional gaming: Something like Dogs in the Vineyard is much more similar to old school D&amp;D than it is to e.g. Vampire in terms of elaborate dice mechanics and a well-defined GM role as opposition for a PC party. Vampire is the less wargame-like game of these two, if the measure we're using is the amount of rules and tools involved.<br/><br/>For another example, consider how "freeform" by that very name was already well-known to the rpg scene in the '80s (and earlier as well, for all I know) and was being advocated by roleplayers who found rules-based games to miss the point. (I'd reference something here, but can't think of a really good example off-hand - would have to look over rpg magazines from the times to find an article or something, I suppose.) Meanwhile roleplaying as a technique had been used, essentially in a freeform manner, outside gaming, for several decades. Surely, if this was a progressive development, one would expect freeform gaming to only become possible as a development after the conceivably earlier forms had been developed.<br/><br/>Of course we can finesse our way around observations of that sort by say fine-tuning the definition of progress so it's not about game mechanics, or we could decide that Dogs in the Vineyard is not a true example of the school of thought I've assigned it to, but rather some sort of atavistic exception, while the "real" story game is one that doesn't have dice or GMs. A lot less explanatory power to the model, though, if it relies on that sort of narrowing down of the initial idea.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I do like the concept of historical development on the basis of prior influence, and I agree with you about many phenomena in gaming having only come about as thorough evolution of pre-existing ideas. For example, I think that the way the concept of "scene" has developed in rpg texts represents a genuine refinement rather than just a matter of creative priorities - in other words, the current idea of the concept better reflects many of the realities of the medium than the way early games generally parsed the issue. I just don't think that the specific things you're considering here, the various schools of thought, are similar evolved phenomena. There's more to them than just progress to finer forms, there's creative <i>choice</i> that people make about playing in one way or another.<br/><br/>If I absolutely had to proffer an explanation right now for why we see freeform gaming as more prominent today than it was 20 years ago, I'd go with a combination of specific Nordic conditions combined with the way Internet supports minor schools in finding cohesion: freeform became more popular sooner in the Nordic countries because gaming is not nearly as commercially conducted here as it is in the USA (freeform is a very anti-commercial notion), and the emergence of the Internet now makes what would have been nigh invisible in the '80s into a visible Internet phenomenon that anybody can join and help along.<br/><br/>Notably my explanation doesn't require the idea that freeform gaming is the natural endpoint of an evolution starting with wargames. The creative inclinations it presents were always there, it just was so minor over the first few decades of rpg culture that only the Internet brought enough of the practitioners together for them to form a community of like-minded gamers. Once that threshold is crossed, getting more attention is much easier; that's why artists create manifestos and such, to help like-minded individuals find where the good shit is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441974/#Comment_441974" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-24T18:45:31+00:00" title="January 24, 2015  6:45PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The Golden Age of games is long past and now we, the diseased remnants, stumble through the garbage dump of a blasted worlds chewing on rusty pieces of metal until we are infected and die.

Though I want to go on a bit about general RPG-esque development in wargame design beyond that because some of it is very reminiscent of developments in narrative/SG spaces. In the main the influence seems to be hitting down into a lot of the campaign and scenario setups than core mechanics for many, but ...<br/><br/>As an explicit example, consider <a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">Two-Hour Wargames' catalogue</a>. (You can actually get your hands on <a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/free.html" rel="nofollow">the core mechanics of their games in a pair of books for free</a>, which is surprisingly helpful.)<br/><br/>There's fewer core mechanics here than in a lot of the current Story Games favourites, mainly focusing on "Reputation" as a 2-6 scalar stat rolled vs 2d6 to get the number of "passed die," dice that roll under the target value. From that, you get -- typically -- up to three results, 0 passed for failure, 1 passed for partial success, and 2 passed for full success. Scaled successes are one of those things I will pretty much always associate with the origin of narrative gaming. The other main mechanic is effectively a dice-pool system with 1-3 a success, 4-6 failures, and results read as active actor minus passive actor, giving -- again -- a shaded degree of success output.<br/><br/>The base level of most of the lines is almost indistinguishable from a map-present RPG with a rules-light core and a set of tables that give Oracular inspiration for random events and effects. The narrative, as such, is reconstructed post hoc as a retelling of the events that happened rather than being the result of dictation from an authority, which is the direction a goodly segment of narrative games have gone in development. Broader expansions of the lines take the same characters and recontextualize them as more abstract entities, but retain the same mechanical interface, another thing that RPG development has moved toward when taking on issues of wider scope.<br/><br/>More specifically, <b><a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/horror1.html" rel="nofollow">All Things Zombie</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/scifi51urrer.html" rel="nofollow">5150: Urban Renewal</a></b>, and the very latest (as in the last month) <b><a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/lathlidicut.html" rel="nofollow">Larger Than Life</a></b> have been pretty much all-but-RPGs because of their focus on individual scale, and with LTL-DC (and the sidebar on UR), are actually being billed as RPGs. That they all have explicitly RPG-derived "if its not covered by explicit mechanics, here's a general resolution mechanic" explicitly involving negotiating with the other players at the table about what the success, potential failure, and partial failures actually mean.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://us-store.warlordgames.com/collections/bolt-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action</a></b>, from Warkord Games, is a company-scale WWII wargame, which you wouldn't think would have much to lift from RPG design, but you can see some pressure that way in the focus on successful conflict resolution being as much or more from non-killing supression over taking little men off the table. <br/><br/>I don't think I've seen a wargame that had a release in the last decade whose scenarios and generated campaign systems weren't reminiscent of the Oracular systems that flare up in popularity around here from time to time. Which is fascinating to me, as a gamer with a foot in each world. Games like <b>Lady Blackbird</b>, with a fixed character identity but generated situations and setups remind me that parallel evolution to wargaming is just that, parallel evolution, and not directly inspired by. That's cool in its own right.<br/><br/>Scenes, as elements of individual experience, are a big part of the THW individual scale games. They're named as "encounters," but what they are is an individual place at a given time with a generated group of NPCs your party/group/character can and will interact with and have a panoply of potential kinds of interaction, including non-violent/social ones. In particular, <b>UR</b> is big on that, going so far as to release an entire book which fleshes out being a Private Investigator in their sci fi setting (though generally applicable to investigative stories in general). Mantic Games does both <b><a href="http://www.manticgames.com/mantic-shop/dreadball.html" rel="nofollow">Dreadball</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.manticgames.com/mantic-shop/deadzone/getting-started/product/deadzone-rulebook.html" rel="nofollow">Deadzone</a></b>, which are both small-group focused games which concentrate on the on-table events within a narrow context (<b>Dreadball</b> being a violent sports game, with all that implies about between game interaction bits), but which have interactions beyond that scope.<br/><br/>My gut says that there's a lot of stuff bubbling under the skin of the skirmish-scale wargaming world that's nudging over toward the narrative side of the world. Likewise, there are some very narrative-heavy designs in RPGs (<b><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/82258/Chris-Perrins-Mecha" rel="nofollow">Chris Perrin's Mecha</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.tao-games.com/bliss-stage/" rel="nofollow">Bliss Stage</a></b> immediately come to mind for very different reasons) which I think consciously and unconsciously lift elements from the wargaming side of the world. I expect more of those things to emerge from similar pressures on both sides of the line.<br/><br/>Which is good! Similar evolutionary pressures leading to similar adaptations in a space gives us reason to think those are good solutions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442101/#Comment_442101" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T07:29:43+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  7:29AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In this thread I'm talking only about the <i>development</i> of RPGs, not about the relative merits of different types, or which ones are more popular or commercially successful or whatever. </blockquote>\nYou can't talk in evolutionary terms about the development of anything without making reference to relative merit in terms of success; success is the whole point of evolution, after all.

If not, then imagine a schematic where a line branches potentially infinitely, and those branches likewise, and so on ad infinitum (which is what I\u2019m talking about when I use the word 'dendritic'), and append to it an alternative descriptor of your choice.\n<blockquote>in reality what we have are a bunch of particle assemblies loosely interacting in a cloud, exchanging particles of various sorts during their lifetimes.</blockquote>\nOk, now you\u2019re positing an alternative model, and yes, I can see how that might be an attractive one, but I still think that most RPGs that are around today originated ultimately in the RPGs of the early \u201870s, because where else would they have come from? Of course, Let\u2019s Pretend, children playing doctors and nurse etc. and the storytelling traditions of many peoples go back millennia, however the <i>mechanics</i> of modern RPGs, (including narrative games) - using dice, having conflict resolution mechanics, scenes and turn order etc.- I maintain go back to Chainmail and D&amp;D et al. So modern storygames, to take one branch, are highly  likely to have been influenced by the storytelling traditions of previous generations, and had them as a backdrop, but as a discrete form they ultimately came from \u201870s RPGs. So I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t accept the cloud of particles model. Sorry!<br/><br/>But I\u2019m going to leave it there, because I\u2019ve said more or less what I wanted to say, and it was only meant to be a fairly light-hearted thread anyway.

Sure, it's different, but only in a kind of incremental, approximate way that's like a single band sliding up and down a spectrum. We might can speak reasonably definitively about something being "more" or "less" like one or the other, but actually pointed difference?<br/><br/>One of the points that I often go to when trying to determine what camp a game or style of play leans toward is to look at the scale of agency. Is a player playing one and only one character as their "self" or are they playing a larger group? That suggests, usually pretty strongly, that in the latter case its tending toward story-heavy wargame and in the former you're talking about a battle-heavy RPG -- but then you get to things like <b>Microscope</b>, <b>Universalis</b>, and <b>Capes</b>, where individual character ownership isn't even a thing mechanically, and the latter two even overtly reward demonstrations of system mastery -- which is a trait typically associated with crunchy wargames!<br/><br/>Or otherwise said, "It's really, really complicated."<br/><br/>Consider <b>Primetime Adventures</b>. Pretty narrative-heavy and dialogue-laden, yes? But the big outcomes of conversations, resolving the narrative impact of those conflicts, often come down to one or two card plays, often up front, and that narrative just gets folded into play. THW does similar things with their Meet &amp; Greet Tests, in almost the same way, except that they bolt an Oracular generator on the front to put together situations instead of having them dictated by a player.<br/><br/>After the fact, both kinds of play generate very similar narrative retellings. In general and very loosely, we end up getting back to the question of "scale of self" being one of the strongest hints. Is your story about you and the other guys in your squad getting through the Battle of the Bulge together and the things you did, or is it about your squad and how they got through the Battle of the Bulge as part of the platoon, and how your guys got on with the other guys. There might be stories about "what that mad fool Buchannan did in Paris," but the self is focused on the way what he did affected the rest of the self. <br/><br/>For extra weird brain-fun, listen to some WWII wargame grognards talk about their squads and the deaths of individuals (well, skirmish-scale grognards) and compare to how RPGites talk about their character and <i>taking wounds and scars</i>. No one cares if they lose an HP; no HP is singular, but a continuing mark, lost limb, or visible setback? Like that time the Krauts shot Buchannon right out of the cupola and they had to get buy with Tom on the .30!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442778/#Comment_442778" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-12T06:45:00+00:00" title="February 12, 2015  6:45AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Fairly old by intenet standards, but check out especially the entires on Mugger Games, Committee Games, and Matrix Games.

This thing has been on my shelf for a while -- and I mean that pretty seriously, since it was published in 1990. The first half of the book is pure historical, while the second talks a lot about design, both in goals and structure.<br/><br/>There is a surprising amount about board and military wargames and a surprisingly smaller amount about miniature wargames, but that makes sense when you remember that Perla is a naval guy, and they pretty much always have done chits more often than minis because scale is so abstract at that level, anyway. The underlying architecture is the same, anyway, for the issues important to us -- that <i>games</i> should be created and directed with an awareness of context.<br/><br/>Man, that sounds awfully Forgey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442779/#Comment_442779" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-12T06:56:27+00:00" title="February 12, 2015  6:56AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>However, clearly wargames (including commercial ones) have been around a lot longer than the early 70s, and in fact, after reading your lengthy and informative post about wargames above, I\u2019m prepared to accept that their development has been distinct from table-top games such as D&amp;D, although I would point out that, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainmail_(game)" rel="nofollow">this wikipedia article on Chainmail</a> shows, Gary Gygax was heavily influenced by wargames, specifically Mediaeval ones.</blockquote>\nMore specifically, <b>Chainmail</b> <i>was</i> a wargame. No question about that, full-stop. It was a relatively rough skirmish-scale / warband-level medieval wargame that Gygax, Arneson, and the boys ended up playing more like what's now known as an ARPG than a warband-game, and they down-scaled it to be more focused on individual characters rather than groups.<br/><br/>Mostly. There's a really good reason that <b>D&amp;D</b> and <b>AD&amp;D</b> had all those pages on hirelings, followers, and strongholds that you start accumulating at Level 12 or so. Because that's when <b>Chainmail</b> started having you build and maintain your fiefdom / fastness / minor douchy / whatnot. <br/><br/>I don't actually ever suggest playing <b>Chainmail</b>. Just -- don't. You'll thank me. Over 40 years of game design evolution on <i>both</i> sides of the aisle show.<br/><br/>I do suggest playing warband and battalion-scale fantasy wargames, though, because they're good fun and dragons are properly terrifying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442786/#Comment_442786" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-12T13:32:29+00:00" title="February 12, 2015  1:32PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm always pretty thrilled when I see another SG participant who knows their way around wargames! Thanks Squidlord!<br/><br/>Two minor tangents:<br/>Naval Gamers love some minis too, at least sometimes. Check out The Miniatures Page site if you don't believe me. Some lovely stuff there, moreso if you add in the SF/Fantasy/Steampunk fleet gaming guys to what the historical guys are doing.<br/><br/>Listen to Squidlord about Chainmail. Terrible game ( compared to what else is out there, even from the same time period of design).<br/><br/>And yes, skirmish gamers often have names and developed histories for their miniatures. Strangely, I also see it more often among historical gamers than among SF/Fantasy gamers, despite the fact that named characters are more commonly a part of play in SF/F games.<br/><br/>Onwards then...<br/><br/>Check out this piece by Ben Robbins, then come back and think about wargames and RPGs for a moment. Here's the addie:<br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/</a><br/><br/>Effectively, most wargames are Gamist adventure games. People win or lose them. RPGs are generally also adventure games. Look at his terminology for defining the differences between Story Games and Adventure Games, per that article.<br/><br/>Okay, right?<br/><br/>Well, some of those things I mentioned from the Wargames Development Handbook are closer to his Story Games, by the terms of Ben's post. It's more about seeing what happens in the situation( given a huge variety of factors, including personalities of command staffers), than about winning as your team. That's pretty different from what most people think of when they think wargame.<br/><br/>Beyond that, if people are interested, I'll try to dig up links to some very story oriented minis games. There are people out there in the minis gaming hobby who are hugely into the whole narrative concept and character development, but again, a niche-y form of the hobby. Easily as niche-y as Story Games are among RPGers.<br/><br/>Just like an encounter with Fiasco or Archipelago will likely be headsplosion inducing to folks who define RPGs by D&amp;D, these things/approaches are pretty far off from the wargame approaches you'll see at the FLGS when people are bashing out a battle using whatever Games Workshop games' latest iteration is.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442787/#Comment_442787" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-12T13:54:38+00:00" title="February 12, 2015  1:54PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a realllllly long example of miniatures wargame RPG play, check out this blog, with attention to this guy's A Devil in Jersey campaign game:<br/><a href="http://bogdanwaz.blogspot.com/2012/08/a-devil-in-jersey-cast-of-characters.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bogdanwaz.blogspot.com/2012/08/a-devil-in-jersey-cast-of-characters.html</a><br/><br/>I wouldn't read all of the posts.

That would be interesting.<br/><br/>Literal textual deconstruction like this is really more useful for talking about terminology and who borrows what from where, after all. And it's fairly easy to tinker with as a creator by deliberately creating and using abstruse terms in contexts no one else does so (which means I expect games like <b>Polaris</b> end up on the fringes because of repeated ritual phrasings, despite being thematically closer to something like <b>Primetime Adventures</b> which will share a lot of card description terminology with games that, likewise, use cards. Similarly, I'd expect games which go into the Scene-based temporal descriptors will end up closer together than those that emphasize "turns" and "rounds."<br/><br/>Lexicographic analysis suggests some kind of relationship in language, but sadly not ideas. And until/unless you can put some pressure on similarity measures by adding in a weighted release/time/age measure, you don't see the kind of evolutionary direction within the corpus. If you do add a temporal measure, though, you can see some really interesting things. Spurious things, sometimes, but interesting.<br/><br/>[looks around] Why are you all looking at me like that?

My best guess is that is after-the-fact fiction based on play, including in-game dialogue.<br/><br/>Post-game fiction creation is common in campaign minis play, especially in multi-player campaigns. In an old  Warhammer 40K campaign I ran in college, we all commonly wrote up post battlein-character propaganda communiques ( usually filled with blatant lies and blame-passing in the manner of Paranoia ). As it was an ongoing game, these would be created after battles and before the next, and went up on the wall of the room we gamed in, creating a sort of artifact/record of events.<br/><br/>In general, the closer the "scale" of the game is to an RPG, the more likely these kinds of things are to occur, in my experience. Likewise, in character dialogue during play, and maybe even some out-of-character narration or internal monologues spoken out loud for the benefit of the fun.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442851/#Comment_442851" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T03:28:38+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  3:28AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">@SquidLord</a> "Make sure to document degrees of similarity at the breakpoints for clusters.

As you can imagine, miniatures-use doesn't really lend itself to play-by-post easily.<br/><br/>In this case, the core idea was that my online-buddy and myself were going to act as a sort of long-distance campaign level GM for each other. Each of us would have our own solo game system of choice, plus our own general setting and miniatures collection. Neither needed to be related to the other partner's in any way*. Rather, the partner with the physical stuff basically took pics of their collection ( or parts of it they wanted to use) and gave some ideas to the GM partner of the broad, overall type of thing they wanted to play. The GM partner on the other end then helped develop the concept and set up the beginning fiction for the minis-owning player.<br/><br/>In the end, my buddy GMed for me, but I never did end up doing any GMing. Roughly, there was a spate of back-and-forth initial fiction writing, then a solo play session on my end, followed by in-character after action reports/slash journal writing. This occurred at "stop points" within the solo session, so there was a series of these as the "battle" developed on my end, and then afterwards.<br/><br/>It was a bit like the style of the novel <i>Dracula</i>.<br/><br/>Not sure if that is what the guy who made A Devil in Jersey did or not, but ours looked somewhat similar, if much less in-depth.<br/><br/>* By unrelated in any way, I mean, not only need the games not be set in the same world, but they could be radically different genres and scales of play. I could be playing a game in the Space 1889 setting with a British punitive expedition and related characters, while my buddy might be playing 1920s Lovecraftian micro-skirmish monster hunting for example. It would be two simultaneous games going on, in entirely different parts of the real world. At the time of the experiment, I was living in California, USA, and my online buddy near York, UK.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442870/#Comment_442870" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T18:40:54+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  6:40PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Do you have any idea where on that spectrum it might fall, based on your experience (if any) with this kind of game? For instance, is the in-character dialogue actually played out?</blockquote>\nI've actually been thinking about this over the last day, just turning the question over in my mind, and the one result I keep coming back to is:<br/><br/><i>"Is this a meaningful question?"</i><br/><br/>After all, as people interested in the experimental edge of RPG design (and we may just have to open that up to "game design" in general, because we may be moving well beyond what anyone understands as the definition of RPGs), at least in theory we've already accepted the idea of fortune-at-the-front, that at the beginning of resolving an issue or situation we go ahead and call on the randomizer or whatnot that defines the outcome of that challenge, and then we go ahead and play it out along with the dialogue, monologues, etc. Does it actually matter \u2013 in a game-theoretic sense \u2013 if the in-character dialogue is delivered before, during, or after the mechanical interactions required to resolve the conflicts of the scene?<br/><br/>There have definitely been times that I've thought about suggesting a game in which not just "the major conflict of the scene," or "this series of exchanges" was resolved before the act of in-character play, but the entirety of a scene. In a very specific sense, that's exactly what we're talking about here: the mechanics of the game driven to mechanical completion and then the players who are invested in that scene turning around and justifying/describing what just happened to both themselves and a theoretical wider audience.<br/><br/>There's a kernel of something that can be played with in the context of indie game design there, but I can't put my finger directly on it. In my mind it's sort of related to <b>Lady Blackbird</b> and other games in which you play out already established scenes, already established characters, and other Oracular-style, external-input-heavy role-playing. There's something there worth tinkering with.<br/><br/>There's a hint of that in <b>Microscope</b> in how Scenes are played out by first asking a fairly leading question (such as, <i>"why did the director of the High Command decide to let the alien fighter wave through?"</i>) and then players play out the Scene, knowing that this question will be pivotal and will definitely happen, and the Scene only plays out until the question is answered and no further.<br/><br/>In a field where we can actually refer to "lonely fun" as part of and a drive in one of the styles of game that is really popular, thinking about blue booking more mechanical events post hoc as somehow separate from the process of play seems to be contradictory. It's fairly clear that such retelling is, in fact, a very important part of play, integral, to the people that engage in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442872/#Comment_442872" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T18:44:39+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  6:44PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I agree that, from a theoretical perspective, the lines get fairly blurry.<br/><br/>But it certainly *feels* different to do it one way versus the other.<br/><br/>My question is not so much a game design question as it is a <i>play culture</i> question.<br/><br/>* What would it look like if I was watching these people playing?<br/>* If I joined in their game, and started speaking "in-character", would they look at me funny, or join in?

I can certainly imagine a game in which gameplay "scenes" proceed in a two phase structure, first being established and the "outline" being created by purely mechanical interaction with a focus on player/system choices and declarations of intent, and then moving into the "retelling" phase where the events that just happened and were established are assumed to have happened just as minimally described, but different mechanics come into play to control who gets to narrate at any given time as you go through the events, quite possibly putting a completely different spin on them and what they might mean via revealing character thoughts, dialogue which was implied but not fleshed out, etc.<br/><br/>Is this something that we can take up in already established games in order to add more dynamics? Blue booking is an old and storied (pun intended) method for asynchronous RPG play, whether it be on forums, LiveJournal posts, email, parcel post \u2013 you name it. Is the idea that you can break the intimate tie between creating the events and creating the narrative something that we can use to make different kinds of experiences in the games we already have?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> , I think it might actually be beneficial if you hunt around your local game scene to see if there are any skirmish-level wargamers actually playing near you. Now, there's no reason to expect that they are as narrative-leaning as some of the rather extreme examples that we've talked about, but nothing really is as effective as going down to the local shop and seeing what people are actually doing. We advocate that all the time when it comes to talking about how are RPG games being played, so it seems kind of obvious that we should also advocate the same when we're looking to see how wargamers play.<br/><br/>Who knows? They might suck you into a few games and you'll have an entirely new type of experience to fold into your design portfolio.<br/><br/>And then you can run a game of <b>Penny for My Thoughts</b> made up entirely of characters of theirs, retired because of significant physical injury or mental exhaustion, all cooped up in the same veterans' hospital, and given an experimental psychoactive drug. Then they'll have an entirely new type of experience to fold into their design portfolios.<br/><br/>The cycle of crossbreeding continues!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442888/#Comment_442888" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T02:24:19+00:00" title="February 15, 2015  2:24AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2015 2:24PM by komradebob.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you go to the game shop to try minis gaming, or the convention or local minis club meet up if they exist nearby, look for games with older gamers and more skirmish style games rather than the bigger name games you find on the shelves of every FLGS that carries minis. Listen for laughter. If these qualities are present, usually you'll be more likely to find roleplaying going on in that wargame.<br/><br/><br/>Edited to add, after some thought:<br/>Regarding play with minis and after the fact story writing based on play, apparently the Bronte sisters did something similar as children. Frankly, I don't now much of anything about the Brontes, but you can find references to it in collections of their juvenile works. It seems to have come about as a result of a gift of a box of tin soldiers when they were in their preteen years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442940/#Comment_442940" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-16T15:02:07+00:00" title="February 16, 2015  3:02PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondal_%28fictional_country%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondal_(fictional_country)</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
