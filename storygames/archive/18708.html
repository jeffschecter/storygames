It went well! I really appreciated other people's actual play posts to help provide inspiration, so I figured I'd post my own. <br/><br/>We established the basics as a group over dinner:<br/><br/><b>Why does your crew need loot?</b> The one name not chosen by any player was Vixen. The players decided she was the "mom" of the crew, being held hostage by Banner, in exchange for some unknown payload. (We decided at that time that the payload was paper \u2013\xa0slang for valuable data\xa0\u2013\xa0and we determined later that stones are a power source used as currency within the ghost world, while metal is slang for straight-up bartered goods, primarily weapons and medical supplies.)<br/><br/><b>What powers and talents does your particular crew member possess?</b> Coil was the lookout, a natural navigator with superhuman powers of hearing in the ghost world. Grip was the demolitions man, both good with explosives in the real world and capable of channeling the ghost field in the ghost world to deconstruct and reconstitute matter kind of like someone playing Minecraft. Demon was a sneaky infiltrator who could channel the ghost field not just to communicate with wraiths, but to tame or even control them. Hull was the transporter, capable of "moving" items between the ghost world and the real world (though we never really figured out whether he was actually literally taking stuff out of virtual reality into actual reality, or whether this was some kind of fancy 3D modeling/3D printing thing he was really good at \u2026\xa0yeah, whatever).<br/><br/><b>What is the ghost world like?</b> The ghost world was basically a post-apocalyptic take on the Metaverse from Neal Stephenson's <i>Snow Crash.</i> It was basically a big VR simulation with different areas once designed for entertainment, information, or what have you, but long since abandoned when it became clear that it was extremely dangerous. The Ruins, for instance, was a recreation of 1930s New York as a crumbling skeleton of a city, believed to have been used once upon a time as a map for a violent online game; at the end of each day, anything that crumbled reconstitutes itself so it's the exact same hellscape as the day before.<br/><br/><b>What is the real world like?</b> Generic near-future. We didn't spend much time in it. There was a much reduced emphasis on networked communications because of the failure of the ghost world.<br/><br/><b>What are echoes?</b> Data I guess? We didn't linger on this.<br/><br/><b>What are wraiths?</b> The trapped consciousnesses (maybe the "ghosts") of hackers who died while jacked in. I was kind of all over the place in describing them in play, but the answer that seemed most appealing to players was "like a metallic glob with teeth and glowing gold eyes, like T-1000 fucked a wolf." I asked why it's a problem to have wraiths on your heels if you can just channel the ghost field to exit the ghost world; everyone agreed that there are designated entry and exit spots, AND the wraiths can follow you out, potentially by possessing people. Hooray!<br/><br/><b>How it went down:</b> While downloading the data they needed from the top floor of The Watchtower, the PCs hear a group of mercs drop onto the roof from a helicopter. A long and brutal fight scene ensued, and the players learned REALLY QUICKLY that this die mechanic can screw you up pretty badly. By the end of the fight, Demon got shot several times and nearly lost an eye, the rest of the team went into repeated convulsions thanks to paranormal backlash, and Hull was knocked out completely when Grip pulled down the roof onto a couple Dogs. The team escaped while the mercs fought the Wraiths who were attracted by all the reckless manipulation of the ghost field. (We mostly forgot to use the "listen for echoes" move, but people kept thinking "attract the attention of one or more wraiths" was from channeling the ghost field, so I just ran with it.)<br/><br/>They made their way through the Ruins to clinic run by a cyborg woman named Carrier. She patched them up in exchange for some odds and ends and a glimpse at the data they just recovered. They didn't even know what they had themselves, so they took a peek, and Vixen herself appeared. She quizzed them on things like her middle name and her favorite color, then revealed that this was her personal log of stashes, and if anybody but her was listening to it, she was dead. Asking around, they also got pretty good evidence that the mercs who attacked them were probably employed by the ones who took Vixen. The team decided the rest of the story would be about getting revenge.<br/><br/>To get to their designated exit point, the team headed to Belltown (which I decided looks like <a href="http://darksoulswiki.wikispaces.com/Anor+Londo" rel="nofollow">Anor Londo</a> because I wanted the ghost world to feel like a patchwork of settings and I miss playing Dark Souls). Unfortunately, during their repeated attempts to channel the ghost field, they attracted the notice of a Viper and some Spiders, and several of them rolled 3-4 results in trying to leave. I wasn't sure how to interpret "the goal was partially achieved" for something like jacking out of VR, so some of them made it out, one of them was able to see the ghost world overlaid on the real world, and a couple of them were wearing the ghost-world equivalent of "POSSESS ME" signs for the wraiths. Grip tried to drive their mobile command center in the real world so the sense of motion would propel half-in/half-out Coil away from the Viper back in the ghost world (think of the tumbling van scene in <i>Inception</i>). Demon headed back in to help her out and took a big gamble, channeling the ghost field with the goal "to control the Viper completely" and danger "allow myself to be merged with the Viper" \u2013\xa0full success on goal, partial on danger. Just as he started merging personalities with a Wraith, Grip crashed the van through the front doors of their client/enemy, and the team was soon surrounded by more armed dudes. Coil and Demon got back from the ghost world, but Demon brought more Viper with him than he could handle, and ended up sharing the Wraith's personality with Hull. (We decided they would each get a bonus die for anything violent they attempted to do in synchronization.) Someone appearing to be Vixen herself came before them at this point, trying to get them to give up, but when she failed to properly answer a question referencing a previously minor plot point from hours before \u2013\xa0"By the way, what's your favorite color?" \u2013\xa0all hell broke loose. Shock grenades flew, giant guns fired, a van was rigged to explode, dozens of Spiders ended up possessing Demon and making him even more violent and badass, and in the end, only a few of them walked out alive \u2013 but they had their revenge.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419961/#Comment_419961" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T22:15:10+00:00" title="August 12, 2013 10:15PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Some thoughts, after:</b> I stumbled over trying to explain certain things, but I think this was largely just me learning to GM a more improvised game. I did wish at times, though, that I went in with better ideas for what certain sure-to-appear terms might mean, like "paranormal backlash." This started out as just momentary incapacitation accompanied by strange visions or perceptual changes (like Coil thinking she had died and was actually in the afterlife), but was later interpreted to mean other stuff, like a vulnerability to wraith possession. I probably also should've just reminded myself that "paranormal backlash" is just a suggested danger and could be replaced with any number of things.<br/><br/>We struggled at times trying to come up with dangers that were entirely unrelated to goals such that it would not be weird to partially succeed at one but fail at the other. Some of that was based on stuff built into the game (like, what does it mean if you fail to "fight through the pain" but partially succeed against the danger of "incapacitation"? We decided it meant you aren't unconscious, but you can't do whatever you wanted to do next \u2026\xa0but we kind of stuttered at moments like that). Some of that was based on goals/dangers I just made poorly (like people suddenly deciding they should roll to remember Vixen's favorite color, and rolling a success on remembering but a failure to avoid the danger of being shocked by the defense mechanisms \u2026\xa0yeah, doesn't really work).<br/><br/>I also had a bit of trouble trying to figure out how to make partially-achieved goals interesting. Being caught between the ghost world and the real world seemed a step in the right direction because it introduced an actual change in the fictional situation, an interesting problem to deal with. Too often, though, it felt easy to interpret a partially achieved goal as just something you had to reroll, again and again, until you finally rolled high enough to say, "yeah, sure, I got it." I tried to let players off the hook from rolling at all when stuff felt like it should be easy enough to call "achieved" eventually, but they really like rolling!<br/><br/>For me, though, the hardest thing was improvising plot. These are players who are used to really pre-planned plots with baked-in themes and a few potential endings and plot twists thought up ahead of time. I didn't know what their characters or the world would be like, so the best I could throw them was a faux-Vixen for shock value and a bloody finish hastily decreed because we were approaching our time cap. (Nice job by Coil on making the favorite color thing a foreshadowed element, though. Still, I felt bad for the guy playing Demon, who I realized too late was planning on interrogating Banner when the entire room exploded. There were no answers to give, though, no grand plot or scheme. Just bad guys who didn't want to pay the crew for work.) I had a much easier time with Lady Blackbird, which offers some suggested story beats and implies a semi-predictable narrative arc ending in a reunion (or confrontation) with a pirate king. I figure I need to get better about improvising stories to actually feel like stories, though, and that's a big reason I wanted to run this in the first place.<br/><br/>All in all, we had a great time.

There are a few tools a GM can use to get things working more smoothly though:<br/>1) The most obvious answer is best. This works on many levels. This works because the players will take the most obvious answer in directions you could never imagine. It works because it is fast and keeps the game moving. It works because it feeds into believability/immersion.<br/>2) When weird results come out of a system like that, I tend to collaborate. Meaning, I will poll the players. I will say something like "Either you both get what you want or neither of you get what you want, what does that look like?" Again, this works on many levels. One it reminds that players that you are not railroading them or otherwise don't have some special thing that they have to look out for. It also works because the players probably already have pictures in their minds on how this will go. Use them if they have an ounce of goodness inside.<br/>3) Think out loud. When I am coming up with counter stakes, I will say stuff like, "I can't have the counter stakes be you loose, that is already determined by the player stakes. And I can't have ti be they die, how do you partially die," etc. This works as a rules teaching tool, as a collaboration tool and helps me sort out what I am doing. The best part is, if you make a habit out of it, the players will spot when you are suggesting something that does not fit your previously established criteria because they have heard them so many times!<br/>  Finally, don't stress it, if you have good players and a good time, the other things come naturally the more you play. If you worry about it or focus on any hangups of previous games too much, it becomes less and less fun until it is no fun at all.<br/>  Good luck with your future gaming and may the schwartz be with you!<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420077/#Comment_420077" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T19:58:17+00:00" title="August 14, 2013  7:58PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the tips! I'm not super stressed about it, but I do hope I get some opportunities to practice more improvisational GMing. Everybody definitely had a good time, but a couple players expressed to me after this and Lady Blackbird that they prefer games where there's at least an illusion that the universe and its laws exist independent of them \u2013\xa0that they're discovering things, rather than creating things. When I let them see the seams or fill in the gaps themselves with questions like "Well, what do you think should happen?", they feel a little deflated \u2013\xa0or, at best, it puts them in another mental space that they don't associate with gaming. (One of them even said that Ghost/Echo made him want to go write a novel based in the setting we created together, which distracted him a bit from trying to focus on playing his character!) I'm still trying to figure out how to present this as a "different but equally fun" way of playing, but I guess it could just be that my buddies like some kinds of games more than others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/albill" title="albill"><img alt="albill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/348/nL4YMQPY0H7JF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/albill">albill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420130/#Comment_420130" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T14:38:51+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  2:38PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group played it as well and we struggled with the extreme minimalism.

I have to admit, though, that this is where my tastes in design aesthetics clash with what I'm good at as a GM.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a>: You know, it never clicked for me before that those questions still preserve the PC/GM division of creative responsibilities that my group is used to. Thanks! I am still wondering whether I might find a way to get us a bit more comfortable with stepping out of those roles \u2013\xa0we'll see how they handle a couple GMless games and some FATE when I get around to running them \u2013\xa0but this is good advice for the other one-shots we have in store soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/albill" title="albill"><img alt="albill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/348/nL4YMQPY0H7JF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/albill">albill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420176/#Comment_420176" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T21:14:53+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  9:14PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think our GM felt it lacked enough info and it was kind of up to us, as players, to flesh it out in a sandbox way. Like I said, just a little too minimalist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
