                    Pulling out from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1604&amp;page=1#Item_6" rel="nofollow">the Character Algebra</a> thread:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: neelk</cite>Now, contrast does not have any necessary connection with the conflict in a story. You can use contrast to reveal similarities between the protagonist and the antagonist just as easily as differences. For example, suppose the *tagonists are a Jedi knight and a Sith lord, and we see them continue to duel on an exploding starship, even as the ordinary soldiers around them run for their lives from the pyrotechnic CGI effects. The conflict is between the two Force-wielders, but the contrast in this scene is between them and the mooks -- we see that the depth of rivalry between these two is deeper than even the human desire for self-preservation. The stormtroopers and rebels don't even need<em>names</em>, as long as we can imagine them as average human beings with a typical desire to live.</blockquote>Wow ... how awesome would it be to have a mechanic where you could only get the advantage of your traits when they contrasted sharply with the behavior of another character ... and where other players (and the GM) had reason to give you those contrasts?<br/><br/>Like, you have a character who has a motif of being determined, and there's a fire.  If he just leaps straight into the fire to try to rescue something then he gets <b>no</b> benefit.  If the GM has a fireman yell "Sir!  Stay back!  You can't help her!" <i>and then</i> you jump into the fire ... <i>that's</i> when you get the benefit, by contrast.<br/><br/>Man, that would be incredibly cool.  I'm so psyched about what that could do to a gaming group, in terms of teaching them to give each other a chance to shine.  I don't know if Misery Bubblegum is the right place for the idea, but it's got to go <b>somewhere</b>.                </div>

                            Ok yeah - that's pretty awesome.  Still, I wonder if it isn't straddling the fine line between game mechanics and play techniques.  Like - is illustrating something through contrast <i>the</i> way to do it, or just a <i>good</i> way to do it?  Of course it's a fine line after all.  I mean maybe it's a +2 way to do it compared to just a +1 way to do it, but.... *trailing off inconclusively*.                        </div>

                            I could see a situation like in Lost, whenever anyone told Locke in the first season that something was impossible, he'd completely freak out and scream "DON"T TELL ME WHAT I CAN'T DO!!"

                            Alex:  LOL!  You big meany! :-)<br/><br/>Thomas:  I dunno.  My technique-agnostic instincts tell me "Nah, that's just one-true-wayism talking ... there must be plenty of situations in which the best way to show something isn't through contrast."  But then, when I try to think of some, I <b>can't</b>.<br/><br/>One of my favorite little insights is this:  "The key phrase of science is not 'Eureka!'  It's not about somebody having a sudden burst of understanding.  No, science is about somebody honestly realizing that they don't know what's going on.  The key phrase of science is 'Wait ... that can't be right.' "<br/><br/>That's about where I'm sitting right now.  I <i>think</i> I know that contrast must be only one technique among many, but I can't summon any evidence.  Maybe I'm right <i>anyway</i>, but (enticingly!) maybe I'm <b>wrong</b>.  Maybe Neel has figured out a solid principle that should be applied 100% of the time.<br/><br/>I'll give one elaboration, though!  Sometimes the contrast isn't against another character.  Sometimes it's against yourself.<br/><br/>End of Star Wars, as the rebels are preparing to launch.  Han Solo is the character who lets Luke show that he's an idealist.  But then, at the very end, Han <i>also</i> shows his idealism.  Does that contrast against Luke?  No.  It contrasts against all of Han's previous behavior.<br/><br/>But, seriously ... I'm open to evidence.  If someone has a situation in which character attributes are illustrated better <i>without</i> contrast than they would be <i>with</i>, when in short contrast is the wrong tool, then fire away.  There's nothing I'd like to hear more.  Let's test this theory out.                        </div>

                            Um... thematic batteries in <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>.  Not exactly the same thing, but: (a) other players are rewarded for referencing your thematic batteries, and one very common way is contrast, (b) you only get to use your thematic battery for a bonus after you charge it up -- often after another player gives you a lead-in by referencing the battery, and (c) every situation has a built-in character foil for each character, often created as a reversal of one of your thematic batteries.  What you describe, Tony, is one of many ways that thematic batteries are used.                        </div>

                            Tony, I don't know that the theory is wrong, but it may reduce to a trivial case.  You say you can't come up with an example where contrast isn't the right tool, so I ask if there is anything you can do in a game that is not a contrast of some sort.  I can't come up with an example of that either. <br/><br/>This doesn't make the whole idea bollocks, but it might mean that the tool you are searching for is not, in fact, a matter of creating contrast but a matter of accentuating it or even just recognizing it.<br/><br/>- Eric Sedlacek                        </div>

It's about what gets into the "ficiton-we're-narrating" rather than simply the "fiction-we-presume."<br/><br/>When the Death Star explodes, thousands (perhaps millions) of people die in the "fiction-we-presume."  I mean ... fully staffed battle-station!<br/><br/>But only Grand Moff Tarkin dies in the "fiction-we're-narrating."  Those other guys who, by all laws of realism, must have died don't get to die on screen.<br/><br/>Likewise, if you've got two jedi fighting in a collapsing star-ship, we can presume that there are people off in the wings trying to save their miserable lives.  But it makes a difference to <i>show</i> those people ... to take them from the fiction-we-presume to the fiction-we're-narrating.                        </div>

It's a procedural way to say, "My guy is about <em>this</em>."  And then the other players can help you portray your character as a guy about <em>this</em>.  Contrast is certainly one way: "Man, all your <em>this</em>-ways are totally silly in the light of my <em>that</em>."  But it is one among many.<br/><br/>There is also:<br/>Similarity: "Now that we are united in <em>this</em>ness, let's go kick some ass."<br/>Implication: "My my, look at what happened to that poor sap NPC who was all about <em>this</em>." *significant look*<br/>Assumption: "Okay, where's our specialist in <em>this</em>?"  *significant look*<br/>Recognition: "I thought you'd want to know that Random NPC George is working to undermine <em>this</em>."<br/>Manipulation: "Hey, I'm going to make that other thing look like <em>this</em> in order to get a rise out of you."<br/>Questioning: "Tell me more about <em>this</em>."  (My favourite playtest example is this right here -- the PCs laid the groundwork for the situation without prompting from the GM.)<br/><br/>But it's all player interaction, and it's targetted player interaction, which is the key for me.  Painting a big red target on your character and saying, "Hit me here" opens up tons of possibilities for very awesome play.                        </div>

The danger I see there is that contrast as an idea is <i>broad</i>.  It's a really fundamental technique in general.  It's trivial to interpret just about any dramatic situation in terms of contrast.  Which, on the one hand, means that is isn't <i>wrong</i> to see conflict as the big grand awesome, but is it <i>usefully</i> right?<br/><br/>Contrast is an incredibly powerful, universal technique.  There's a bloody good reason that it's everpresent.  Thing is, sure, you can look at any given awesome and see what a huge role contrast plays, but if you're sitting at a table with situation and characters is "Ok guys - contrast!" the best way to get there?  I reckon that's the question to be asking - can explicit acknowledgment of how contrast rocks be useful to get somewhere nifty?<br/><br/>But then that's the trick isn't it?  I'll ponder some more.                        </div>

                            Thomas:  Damn fine point.  I will also ponder.<br/><br/>First thoughts:  If you have, clearly flagged, the things that people want to use contrast to show about their characters then that gives you an ability that you wouldn't have without those flags.  <br/><br/>For instance, suppose Superman has "Larger than life" as one of his Contrasts, and Grod throws a bus into him, slamming the whole mess against a building.  Because I know his contrasts, I know that I should be having someone in the crowd cry out, in despair, "Nobody could possibly have survived that!"<br/><br/>If there is no such flag, and I (incorrectly!) assume that Supes's player wants to highlight his "Cool-headed" as a Contrast then I might have the crowd go crazy with fear, running hither and yon in utter panic.  But that really isn't a very good contrast for "Larger than life."<br/><br/>Is it hard, if you have the flags, to think up Contrasts?  Is it likely that you'll think up a wrong Contrast ... one which <i>you</i> think provides a good contrast to the flagged attribute, but which <i>they</i> think doesn't?<br/><br/>I'll be pondering.<br/><br/>EDIT:  This is, I'll point out, pretty much precisely what JBR is talking about.  Flagging things clearly is a powerful tool in this context.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Similarity: "Now that we are united in<em>this</em>ness, let's go kick some ass."</blockquote>Okay ... y'know what?  I don't buy that this works.<br/><br/>Here's some similarity:  End of <i>Fellowship</i>.  Aragorn kicks some freakin' orc ass.  Then Legolas stabs an orc in the eyeball with an arrow and kills another orc by shooting it with the same arrow.  Then Gimli does ... some axe thing ... and already I'm not viewing them as particularly heroic.  Gimli's the tough axe guy ... by contrast with Legolas as the lithe archer, and ... anyway.<br/><br/>Y'know the moment that is utter butt-kicking heroism?  The orcs bear down on Merry and Pippin, and they're running, and they're running, and they're cut off ... and you get these <b>big</b> close-ups of their eyes, darting back and forth, looking for an escape, because <i>all they can do is run</i>.  And then Boromir comes barrelling in like a fuckin' <b>freight train</b> and one-handed grabs an axe on the down swing and kicks the orc who swung it straight in the orc-berries.<br/><br/>Showing lots of people who are similar in aspect X makes them each less about X.  Showing people who differ makes the one who has X more X than ever before.                        </div>

                            Usually I think of the similarity version in terms of different folks coming to the same conclusion through different means.  It's the penultimate moment of any story where the protagonists are scattered and then come back together -- both geographically and in terms of motivations.  Which is why I framed it as "Now that we are united" rather than "Since we are united."  I may have relied a little too much on delicate wording, there.  In any case, it's the all-come-together moment, where the estranged son and the stern father exchange the meaningful look before barrelling in to kick some ass side by side.<br/><br/>Damned if I can think of an example at the moment, though.                        </div>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>I think you're dead on when the "thisness" is ability. This is where we need JD to come in and scream "NICHE PROTECTION" five times in a row. (Though one wonders if you see five sexy girls standing all in a group and shaking it, if it makes them all less sexy or more....) <br/><br/>When the "thisness" is a character trait rather than an ability it can work. If all the heroes are united by their feirce patriotism then you can get an element where you go "wow, this is the most patriotic group ever" because there is something they all share that is easily identifiable. <br/><br/>If you want to take it into a nifty spiral effect you can then say: it probably works best when said trait is something the group posseses that others outside the group do not posses. Then the group is contrasted with those not the group. So you've used shared thisness with contrasted not-thisness. After you add an antagonist who has the trait too, so at that point you have shared thisness vs not-shared thisness in line with contrasted not-thisness. <br/><br/>(If you can read that last sentance, I salute you.) <br/><br/>Most of the tools Josh was talking about work best when used in combination. Its like you can be a good boxer if all you've got is a right cross. You've got to have the jab too, even if the jab is a weaker attack.<br/><br/>Which ties back into your Fellowship example. Because it isn't just that Bromir's ability to kick ass was contrasted to the hobbits inability to do so -- it was also that his lack of loyalty to the Fellowship, which had been the contrast that set him apart until that moment, was suddenly reversed and he was a member of the group again. Until, you know, he got shot with a tree.<br/><br/>I'm fairly sure that Jonstone talks about this kind of repitition and change in Impro or Impro for Storytellers.                        </div>

                            Tony, I don't want to give the impression that this is the one true technique, hallowed be its name. It's just that contrast is one of the small handful of techniques I understand well enough to explain clearly. <br/><br/>The reason I can explain it is because Emily Care explained to me that the way things become important in an rpg is when the things we make up are accepted and elaborated upon by the other players, and I know how to put using contrast into that framework. Like, one way I can take "your stuff" seriously and engage with it is to challenge it with a conflict. Another way is to highlight it with contrast -- if you want to play someone brave, I play someone cowardly, to make your PC's bravery easier to see.<br/><br/>Yet another way is to put land mines into the game (this seems like what Joshua is calling Implication and Manipulation). Like, if I know that your PC is prone to jumping to assumptions, I can have my PC start having regular lunches with your PC's husband, and  making clear to the players (but not the characters) that they're just friends. Now, I've set things up so that you can have your PC jump to the conclusion that my PC and your PC's spouse are having an affair. You don't have to do it immediately -- you can save it for when sometime in the future you need something to do. And in the meantime, everyone can savor the potential for disaster. (I will bet hard cash money that the other players will immediately start looking for apparently innocent comments that will sow jealousy in your PC's mind.) <br/><br/>Now that the giant disclaimer is out of the way, let me talk about what I've done in the past. I've used this idea during character creation, pairing off complementary traits like Bravery/Cowardice, Wisdom/Impulsiveness, Brick/Martial Artist, and so on. Then, the rule is that someone can only pick up a trait for their PC if someone else has the complementary trait. I got this idea from Greg Porter's EABA, which had a set of advantages that modelled each of the traditional roles of quest fantasy, like Chosen One, Wise Mentor, and Rebel, but which had the condition that every PC had to take one of the roles, more or less. This ensured the Wise Mentor would have a Chosen One to mentor, and the Rebel would have a Mentor to make fun of, and so on.<br/><br/>This worked really well, but isn't nearly as flexible as the examples you're talking of, with the reversals happening dynamically. That's a really cool idea.                        </div>
