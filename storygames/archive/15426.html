Sorry if 'piece of setting' is confusing, but I'm not sure what to call it exactly. The examples I gave are things like 'a moral crusade' and 'a revolutionary underground'.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game would be a mush; if you're not familiar with that it's an online text-based game with possibly 50+ players playing at any time of day. GM-full or GM-less games would work particularly well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm looking around for RPGs whose systems might work or be adapted for that kind of game; I've seen suggestions of Nobilis, Birthright, Aria, and Pendragon. What games would you recommend?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349917/#Comment_349917" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T09:34:12+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  9:34AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://norwegianstyle.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/archipelago_2009.pdf" rel="nofollow">Archipelago II</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349937/#Comment_349937" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T12:56:26+00:00" title="November 29, 2011 12:56PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen <a href="http://www.ndpdesign.com/annalise" rel="nofollow">Annalise</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349964/#Comment_349964" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T15:13:57+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  3:13PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends a lot on what you imagine this play looking like. (I have a background in MUSHing so all of that part is clear.) Are the players going to be advocating for their 'piece of the setting' in the same way they would be expected to advocate for a single character? Eg. is the player of the 'revolutionary underground' expected to play them in a way that tries to make the revolutionary underground more successful, more influential, more radical?<br><br>And I guess most importantly what does play look like when two players play together, and their setting-pieces interact? Are they going to describe high-level societal/setting interactions in broad strokes, or are they likely to transform their 'piece' into specific characters and play out a specific scene of interaction? And what sort of consequences are these scenes meant to have on each players' respective pieces, and consequently the setting in general? Is the goal to have something that radically changes, or to explore the consequences and variations inherent to a mostly-static situation? (Knowing MUSHes I am guessing 98% the latter but with everyone pretending they want the former.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
