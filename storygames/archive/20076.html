It went pretty well, and everyone had a good time. I think it was too easy for the players, mostly due to me being not very good at doing good strategic thinking whilst trying to do all the other jobs a referee does. Four players who are putting all their effort into strategy trump me every time.<br/><br/>The things that went really well were the PCs running around the valley warning outlying farmsteads, scouting out the invaders, and then returning to prepare the village for war. Lots of Charisma/Leadership rolls, organising logistics and defences.<br/><br/>One thing that was a bit sticky was actually resolving the combat. We had the goblins advancing on the villagers' palisade while the villagers attacked them with volleys of arrows. I improvised some rules, but they were a bit complicated and inelegant.<br/><br/>Since then, my subconscious keeps working on the problem of better rules, but I've been trying to avoid the temptation to put lots of thought into it - because I'm guessing there is already a pretty decent ruleset out there. So I appeal to you, Story Gamers: What mass combat rules do you know / have you used with OSR games?<br/><br/>If there isn't anything good, maybe I'll post my thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443709/#Comment_443709" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T12:03:39+00:00" title="March  5, 2015 12:03PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only big problem I see with that situation is a likely lack of d20s.<br/><br/>Did you have a multiple of any other dice?

In h2h, goblin hits probably go up to 1/2 the time. Peasant hits stay the same.<br/><br/>You can work from that. Use pools of d6s. Assume any hit makes the goblin or peasant KO'ed for the course of the fight( assume 2/3s survive wounded, then figure out later what either side will do with survivors that are at their mercy).

It's basically a return to the wargame logic, and it actually works better than the rpg-traditional method of quantifying an overall effectiveness rating for both sides and introducing some randomness with dice: the "one man = one die" and "one hit = one casualty" principles do a lot of the statistical gruntwork for you simply because of the binomial random distributions involved with the dice pools and such. For example, matters like reducing force effectiveness work automatically with dice pools as you whittle down the forces.<br/><br/>(That wargame reference? It's because that's what the core tradition of miniatures wargame design reduces to: the terrain and the figures are there to play out the timing of force concentration, while the actual outcomes are often rolled out with dice pools, just like described here. Warhammer is a famous example, but this approach is like the stat+skill of miniatures wargaming in my experience.)<br/><br/>For larger fights you could have one die represent one team/line/manipuli of men, of course - usually rolling more than like 10 dice at a go isn't necessary precision for this sort of thing. Easy to scale, easy to add modifiers, easy to like.<br/><br/>Another thing to do is to use conflict resolution/negotiation processes to cut through fictional ambiguity and avoid getting bogged down in the minutiae. For example, the GM can strategically (in the sense of fulfilling the creative agenda in a smart way) just grant many details to the players and move directly to the most significant choices: "OK, given the plan you hashed out in advance, everything seems to be going well. Let's roll a smarts check for the goblin warchief... seems like he's in the dark, he's doing exactly what you expected of him. Let's just assume that your materiel is in place and ready for the showdown as you intended. But now the worlfriders are coming in from the flank, there are more of them than you expected - they sweep your measly screen and will hit your flank momentarily. The question is, will you commit your reserves - that's Bob and Martin plus their retainers - against them? As veteran fighters you see that this'll likely be a glorious death, but the alternative is gonna be that they'll pin your flank in five minutes or so."<br/><br/>There's a lot going on in that sample GM piece, but the idea is to use real knowledge of the fictional situation and the rules of engagement that govern the type of combat at hand; this admittedly requires both good fiction-handling skills and some solid (not necessarily realistic, but interesting and coherent at least) knowledge of the actual subject matter of pre-modern combat. If you can pull it off, everybody at the table gets to participate, and they get to make organic fictional decisions about the main turning points of the battle.<br/><br/>If you run a given mass combat in this manner, it's possible to put in large-scale conflict resolution checks: for example, a one-roll determination of whether Bob and Martin manage to survive the wolfriders, delay them, or even turn them back. Use of degrees of success and such shenanigans, or a series of cascading rolls, will help to determine casualties and such consequences for individual combat actions like this. Sooner or later the combat comes to a natural end due to the strategic and tactical constraints of the situation. You might get through it without ever rolling dice once for the actual combatants in the afore-described dice-pooling manner, it could all occur through narration, choices and abstract conflict-resolution checks.<br/><br/>I can personally recommend both of the above methods, they work great and have their own strengths to consider for different types of situations. (Remember that you're not trying to look for one perfect system to rule all mass combats - you're looking for a flexible method that enables you to bring the interesting and challenging elements of various fictional situations to the fore.) I don't have practical experience with the various mass combat systems that e.g. TSR has published, but they seem relatively boring as reading material to me; if I wanted to run something resembling an actual wargame - implying that it'll take all night for that one skirmish - I'd probably just use a wargame rules set I like and use that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443711/#Comment_443711" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T12:54:39+00:00" title="March  5, 2015 12:54PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2015 12:55PM by komradebob.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used almost exactly that second method in the days before I'd played an actual miniatures rule-set, and for years afterwards in RPGs when I had no urge to bust out detailed maps, Eero!<br/><br/>I also agree that the older TSR era mass rules I've seen are fairly boring.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443712/#Comment_443712" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T13:07:59+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  1:07PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more thing: Martin mentioned that he's getting tactically outplayed by the rest of the group because of their brain power advantage. This is generally not a problem as long as you come prepped with enough advance <i>knowledge</i> (as opposed to brilliant wits): it is generally sufficient for NPCs to act upon common doctrine when it comes to combat strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>For example, if NPCs are besieging a castle the adventurers are defending, it is generally sufficient for the GM to introduce siege methodology that is utterly by the book; no daring night-time raids to torch the harbour or anything, just the basics from your chosen reference work on siege warfare. Take it more as a task of showing the players what it's like than as a task of outsmarting them - you're showing them what a medieval siege is like and why it works the way it does, and their job is to look for the holes in the paradigm so you can find out together what happens, and perhaps learn more about what works and what doesn't.<br/><br/>(Note that flubbing the NPC play so they're even stupider than competent mediocrity would suggest isn't much of a problem either: you just have to accept that this NPC wasn't quite so bright after all. I find that there is no lower limit to NPC competence where the game stops working; to the contrary, it empowers PCs and puts them in positions of trust and responsibility if all the other people in the setting are incompetent, passive mouth-breathers. The game won't break, even if the GM might have to adjust their expectations of how smart the NPCs can realistically be, given the GM's prep chances, skills, knowledge and gaming tools.)<br/><br/>Sometimes you'll end up running a flashy NPC hero who is supposed to be proactive, original and brilliant as well. In those cases you'll want to prep just a little bit, just like you'd do with a dungeon - a competent NPC is like a dungeon, it needs prep for the same reasons you might want to prep a dungeon instead of improvising it. The prep combined with some slight amount of abstraction (like, you roll a wits check for them to find out that yes, they did expect this situation and prepared accordingly - same as you might do for a PC on occasion) will help you provide a quite reasonable simulation of what it's like to go against a genius, at least in my experience.<br/><br/>Of course it just could be the case that we're all rather poor tacticians, and even poorer when we form a brain trust, so whoever is currently GMing will find it easy to out-think the genius patrol on the other side of the table <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443730/#Comment_443730" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T17:52:48+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  5:52PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2015 5:54PM by MartinEden.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of stuff here. Let me work through it. (I've been ill yesterday and today, so apologies if my wits are more dull than usual!)<br/><br/>"Wargaming approach": So as I understand it, Bob (and Eero) are suggesting that I roll a pool of dice for each side with 1 die per combatant, or 1 die per group for larger numbers. Each hit removes a die from the opposing pool (representing casualties: possible deaths - that's our normal procedure anyway for combatants being downed). We can vary the effectiveness of the two sides (and of subgroups within the sides) by changing the target number for a die to count as a success.<br/><br/>So in my situation, where 20 of the goblins advanced at a charge while 20 others traded volleys of arrows with the 50 villagers, I would do something like:<br/>* 50 villagers is too many, let's use a 1/5 scale.<br/>* So roll 10d6 for the villagers and 4d6 for the goblins.<br/>* The villagers are less competent than the goblins at fighting, so choose 5 as the target number for the villagers, and 4 for the goblins (1 in 3, 1 in 2).<br/>* The villagers have a significant morale boost from a member of the party's high Charisma rolls (rousing speeches, decisive leadership - we played these things out as well as rolling). So reduce target number to 4.<br/>* The villagers are behind a palisade wall, so increase the goblins' target number to 5.<br/>* For the initial volleys, which are at maximum range, increase the target numbers for both sides by 1.<br/><br/>We may run into problems with the lack of granularity of d6s. So having lots of d10s or d20s might be nicer if we do this sort of thing a lot.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could used a fixed target number, and just add extra dice to the pools to represent advantage. This is treating things more abstractly - instead of each die continuing to correspond to a fixed number of goblins or villagers, they more abstractly represent the remaining fighting fitness of each side. Any reason to prefer one approach over the other? My instinct is for the former (varying target numbers) because it feels closer to the fiction.<br/><br/>We could represent a big troll on the battlefield, if we borrow from the siege of Gondor a moment, as 1 automatic hit for the troll's side every turn. This troll is never taken down by the general pool rolls; something extra has to happen. For example, an order for archers to concentrate fire, or the party leading a band of crack troops in.<br/><br/>Have I understood this wargaming approach correctly? I'll take a look at the other things we've talked about in a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443737/#Comment_443737" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T20:28:02+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  8:28PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could also use bonus and penalty dice - these are added dice to the pool, but you take the best/worst dice out after the roll. This has some favourable mathematical qualities, mainly that it's relatively safe - difficult to influence outcomes <i>too</i> much with unthinking modifiers.<br/><br/>And yes, you could use d10 or whatever - we've used d20 a lot, as the group isn't afraid of rolling 20 of them at once, and there's plenty lying around (the table looks like a Donjon convention at times). Also has the advantage of scaling the same way all the adventurer activities do (my last homebrew is a very unified-mechanic thing, everything runs off the d20 scale), which means that the same scale and logic of bonuses and penalties applies.<br/><br/>Regarding your sample rundown of various tactical modifiers, I would probably seek to break some of those things down into events and situations rather than bald modifiers; partly because we don't want to choke in numbers, partly because they are excellent opportunities for immersing in the situation and having some choices and decisions in there.<br/><br/>For example, instead of accounting for the palisade as a modifier, I might (depending on the exact fictional detail) give the villagers a few rounds of low-lethality missile fire opportunity (whatever they have to throw or shoot with) while the goblins work to breach or climb over the obstacle. (Shooting at the palisade would have negligible effect, presumably.) The adventurers can, likewise, react to it when they see what the goblins are doing. If they can't establish a real capability of coming over, they've lost by default, no dicing really necessary - that's the strength of a wall. Each round of mass combat would probably be like 10 minutes long - like an exploration turn, plenty of time to run a skirmish in between if the PCs decide to interfere on a lower level at some point. Ultimately of the modifiers you mention I'd probably retain only the inherent combative advantage of the goblins; the other things would become positioning elements that determine who fights who at different times. After all, successful force concentration (having the mostest in the right place the fastest as some American general said) is at least as important as the capabilities of the troops, when it comes to running a combat.<br/><br/>You generally want to keep with the idea that each fighter gets their own die to hit with, mainly because that makes it easier to account for the impact of attrition as the fight goes on. If you're adding and deducting dice here and there for various things, you might lose the idea that an attrited fighting force has less fighting strength left to fight with. The dice numbers also give a relatively realistic accounting for what it means to fight at e.g. 1:2 odds - other dicing mechanics require you to directly determine bonuses and penalties for force ratios.<br/><br/>But anyway, the details are details. The most important is that you start with something simple enough that you can handle it, and then develop it as you go. This way you get something that you grok instinctively, and are able to relate to the fiction as it changes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443819/#Comment_443819" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T16:01:53+00:00" title="March  8, 2015  4:01PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick follow-up question: would PCs use their own dice/HP/weapon damage if they participate in the combat or would they fall under the mass combat 1-die-one-fighter rule?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443822/#Comment_443822" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T16:52:54+00:00" title="March  8, 2015  4:52PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me it would be a feature to have the mechanization be elegantly zooming in and out as necessary. This is one of the main reasons to use the D&amp;D rules chassis at all, that it reduces combat into a pass/fail hit filter with optional damage layer on top; with this structure of the rules system you have the option of resolving matters at whatever level of abstraction required.<br/><br/>All that is to say that yes, I'd definitely have any PCs personally messing with combat use the full combat system, as PCs are generally speaking so important to the group that nobody wants to abstract away a situation that might be life and death for them.<br/><br/>For a situation that is unnecessarily complex and tedious, with low personal stakes, you should probably just skip the personal contribution part in some manner. For example, give the good guys a bonus die to represent the PC contribution, with 1/6 chance after the battle to discover that one of them took 1d6 damage to the chest. You pick the most appropriate degree of abstraction on the fly, and negotiate with the players to ensure that the constancy and fairness of the rules application is preserved.

The terrain is the highly defensible bugbear/hobgob longhouse.<br/><br/>Having the PCs confront the two enemy "bosses" using the normal combat rules has already been framed, hence the initiative rolls we ended with last night, so that's no problem. But it would actually be great to have a way to resolve the fight between the two groups of NPCs somewhat objectively, since the state of the PCs' temporary allies may actually make a huge difference to their long- and short-term health.<br/><br/>My one concern about using the "two fistfuls of dice" approach is that the Ogres, individually, have *vastly* more hitpoints than the other side's troops. Like 60 versus 11, or something absurd like that; the bugbears only have 27. Any ideas how to account for that? (Oh, and with AC it's reversed: the bugbears and hobgobs have amazing ACs, the Ogres have crap.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443849/#Comment_443849" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-09T11:10:19+00:00" title="March  9, 2015 11:10AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, with monsters it's a good idea to just give them more "hit points" in the abstraction as well - just like you'd do in Chainmail. The bottom-most simplification into simple dice pools with no record-keeping mostly makes sense in a non-heroic D&amp;D context where nobody on average has multiple hit dice and everybody is about as destructive as everybody else.<br/><br/>Occasionally hit points are not a good representation of staying power in battlefield conditions (we all know how hairy their history and variation in usage is), so it's not a given that ogres should be able to tank 6 hits for each 1 hit the hobgoblins take, but if you conclude that this is indeed the case considering the tactics, then that might just be what you'll need to do: choose some bigger dice to represent the ogres, and say that each of those dice will only go down if they take six hits. More elegantly (the way I'd do it), you could abstain from tracking ogre HP and just say that one of those ogre dice will only go down if 3-4 successful dice from others target them during the same round.<br/><br/>It might not be a fruitful course of investigation in 5th edition, but one reason to doubt the high HP numbers that ogres get is that at some point it presumably becomes easier to wrestle the mighty weapons-immune ogre down and choke them with a plastic bag (or poison, to pick a tool slightly more common in D&amp;D dungeons). Point being that HP does not necessarily strictly reflect the relative difficulty of taking down a foe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443855/#Comment_443855" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-09T14:06:29+00:00" title="March  9, 2015  2:06PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2015 2:08PM by Potemkin.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the players wanted to run with being the heroic commanders of fantasy armies for a time, how might I flesh out mass combat into a more engaging, rounded military campaign procedure?

This might, I admit, be because I have a relatively good handle on the logistics and such armchair general topics without a system, too. I would, based on my own experiences, encourage everybody to leave the bald "supply rating" scores by the wayside and embrace the joys of counting mules and speculating about the quality of the footwear; that's where the game is at, in the emergent fictional detail and the joy of learning more about the picturesque topics such as the logistics of supplying a mercenary army in the middle of enemy territory.<br/><br/>(Rules systems have different causes for existing. One of them is that the rules tell you what to pay attention to when you don't know the subject matter yourself. Dungeoneering procedure systems are like this, for example - they're needed because the players wouldn't otherwise know to fill the lantern every four hours. I think that "running an army" is also a classical example of such; as far as I can see, the only reason for those TSR army-simulation rules to exist is that they judge the sufficiency of the supply so you don't have to decide yourself how much a mule can carry.)<br/><br/>We generally leave the book-keeping responsibilities related to followers, including companies of soldiers, to the players, while the GM holds the role of the prosecutor. So when we play the army game the GM asks e.g. "what is your supply situation, do you have enough water for the mules?" and then the players answer such questions on the basis of their book-keeping, and make necessary maneuvers to account for any failures. If there are problems, they are categorized in terms of creative agenda - is this something where the players need to improve their book-keeping, or is it an issue we want to constructively ignore from now on (nothing ensures that the prosecutor-GM is asking the right questions, after all), or is it an adventure hook, or is it something the characters would have thought of to fix even if the players didn't, or is it an outright failure of intelligence on the part of the players, with bad consequences for all.<br/><br/>(Consider: a 200-head company is rather unlikely to leave for a week's desert trek without taking any water along, even if the players forgot to account for it in their prep. In this modality of play we would categorize this sort of logistical failure as a whim of the medium we're playing in, so rather than punishing the players for it we just fix it and move on. Meanwhile, if they "forgot" to take malaria medication, that's a true-to-life failure of preparation that we'll let them live with.)<br/><br/>In practice this approach to the matter causes the group to slowly gain in proficiency in dealing with this specific kind of subject matter, which in turn enables us to delve deeper into the particulars, making the game deeper and more complex. It is in fact the same exact process as the one that happens in dungeoneering: you start simple, give the players leeway (assume that their characters are taking care of the necessary breaks and drinking and light sources and whatever), but as they gain in proficiency you give the game more depth and complexity.<br/><br/>In fact, I guess that my answer can be boiled down to a single principle: you don't want to predetermine and preimagine a mode of play that you indoctrinate the group in; rather, you follow the mutual curiousities of the players, and in time work your way down to the level of detail and focus of play that the group wants to be at. I could hazard that introducing a premade formal system into this process of exploration might be a mistake insofar as it enables players to mechanize themselves to subject matters of play that they are not competent to handle in terms of the fiction; what sense does it make to play the captain of a tercio if you do not know what enfilade is?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443882/#Comment_443882" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-10T12:30:07+00:00" title="March 10, 2015 12:30PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeez, I keep coming in to post stuff, and Eero has already nailed the subject thoroughly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443883/#Comment_443883" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-10T14:53:48+00:00" title="March 10, 2015  2:53PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right?

The travel starts and when problems arise, players get to use whatever they prepared. If they hadn't specifically prepared for that situation, the DM can have the players roll INT (or the relevant skill) to find out if among the extra preparations they can find something useful.<br/><br/>This can be regulated easily depending on how much experienced is the group. It must have a limited amount of uses, so players know it's a last resort mechanic. The amount of uses can be dependentant on how much time and money they spent with those extra preparations. At any point you can drop this mechanic (as long as you tell the players in advance) once you consider the players have enough experience, if you want to make the logistics part of the game harder. Or if players are having fun with it because they care more about the roleplayiing and combat escenes of the game, you can keep it.<br/><br/>About mass combat, I'd let players choose if they want their characters to go to the front, support the army or lead from the back. For front-liners, we zoom in into de usual combat detail. For supporters, they can either move into a duel to help the vanguard, use the chase rules or a sort of "dungeon made out of armies" to act as messengers between the front and the rear, roleplay with entire groups of soldiers for raising morale and/or giving them orders, etc. For the leaders on the rear, they get to see the major movements of the field, roll perception or insight to foresee their enemies movements, roll int for tactics/counters and roll their persuasion/intimidation leadership to order the troops around on the spot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443919/#Comment_443919" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-11T14:57:52+00:00" title="March 11, 2015  2:57PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Potemkin:<br/>I have no idea how much food or water any animal needs.<br/><br/>I'd cheat and simply ask at a site like theminiaturespage.com, probably on the Victorian Era boards.

The principal knowledge heuristic is to realize that there is no effective difference between knowledge good enough to convince us and knowledge that is true; we can play based on the former, even if it deviates from the latter.<br/><br/>In other words: whatever amount of water a mule drinks in the real life, what matters for the sake of our gaming exercise is what we think is credible in this regard. If we guesstimate a number and something stops working ("Hey, how come I can't make Xenophon's expedition work with these numbers?"), that's a good argument for fixing the number ("OK, clearly the mules aren't drinking the entire river's daily outflow every day - we need to lower this number.").<br/><br/>Furthermore, even without knowing the exact trivia, how much can you really go wrong in a matter of real-world logistics like this? The answer is very clearly not 1 liter (a human wouldn't get by on that, and a mule is no camel), and it also clearly is not 100 liters (that'd be what, like one third of its own body weight - surely not), so at the very worst you'll miss the correct figure by one magnitude by relying on a simple ass-pull. How often will an error of one magnitude have important effects upon your logistics play, considering the level of detail at which you operate? Remember that the level of detail goes hand in hand with subject competence, so presumably you'll have found out a more correct figure by the time it really starts to matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443922/#Comment_443922" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-11T15:33:43+00:00" title="March 11, 2015  3:33PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I may be distracting from the issue of troop supply and logistics, but I'm interested in what Eero said above:\n<blockquote>In practice this approach to the matter causes the group to slowly gain in proficiency in dealing with this specific kind of subject matter, which in turn enables us to delve deeper into the particulars, making the game deeper and more complex.

The main realization regards creative agenda, I feel - why are we doing this in the first place? I think that there is value in understanding the world in general, and I think that games, as other art, are there to teach us an expand the horizons. This specific sort of game, the challengeful adventure game, proposes to allow us into the shoes of people in exciting adventurous situations, with a chance to see how things work: why do I win, why do I lose as a general of armies or intrepid grave robber? It's not (only) about the euphoria of an imaginary victory, it is about really testing our wits and knowledge in the fulcrum of peers. In D&amp;D rules exist in service of <i>that</i>, not as a barren monument of perfect design frozen in time and referenced out of mighty tomes.<br/><br/>The process of play needs to support the creative agenda, and a peculiarity of the really old style roleplaying game (particularly D&amp;D, but also some others) is that it is not a mechanical process - the system of play is not mechanical, but rather methodological. They didn't use these words, but I think that this is what e.g. Gary Gygax meant with those books about real dungeon mastering and so on - that the quality of the game does not rest upon its mechanical precepts, but rather on the procedural methodology (for which he saw the GM as the gatekeeper and mandated enactor). This is often understood as some sort of ineffable, even heroic quality of "good GMing", but I think that it's game design just like setting design or mechanical design, even if we seem to lack much of the vocabulary for talking about what needs to go into the procedure of play for it to bear fruit in a consistent and "sharp" manner. (Sharp in the sense of not getting lost in the murk and confusion - remembering what you're doing and why, playing purposefully.)<br/><br/>I made a GM screen for old school D&amp;D a while back (ostensibly for LotFP, but I don't think Jim liked it much), and one part of the screen was this collection of GMing maxims that I felt it would be a good idea to have in front of the GM at all times. Perhaps they help to illustrate how creative agenda flows into procedures, which in turn hammer out rulings that turn into rules:<br/><br/><b>Referee homilies</b><br/><br/><i>Negotiate towards challenge</i><br/>Actively offer peril and glory, and listen to the response. Let the players choose their risks, for only in this way will they also accept the consequences. Only players may grant legitimacy to what happens.<br/><br/><i>There is no plot nor balance</i><br/>Play consists of a dynamic web of choices and their consequences, of challenges won and lost. Prepare content, not outcomes. For slaying the dragon to matter, it has to be a dragon, and it has to be slain.<br/><br/><i>Rulings, not rules</i><br/>The authority of the game lies in the imaginary. Where established rules fail the imagination, it is the task of the Referee to develop a new ruling. Ultimately there are no rules, merely a body of case law.<br/><br/><i>Be principled</i><br/>Develop your own style and vision, yes, but be deliberate and consistent in your decisions. Seek principles that overlay structure onto the vast powers granted to the referee. Remember the purpose of play.<br/><br/><i>Players are often right</i><br/>You play with others because of desire for their participation. When a player argues their position in good faith, seek agreement; winning an argument is nothing, while legitimacy of rulings is everything.<br/><br/>You can perhaps see the shape of how I understand the mechanical process of the game in there: rules arise as case law, in the manner of traditional precedent-based lawcraft, out of the process of real play and rulings considered necessary in the particular context therein. There is, generally speaking, a rules <i>chassis</i>, but in a living tradition of play the chassis is indistinguishable from the history of play of the participating author/gamers: the rules you choose reflect the rules you like, and the rules you like are the ones that work for you, and the ones that work for you are a subset of the ones that you've used or heard used, and the ones you've used, ultimately, are the ones that somebody introduced you to in the dim past - it is really rather irrelevant where the rules chassis originates, as in practice we may start anew now and then, but we're still bound by our prior experience when utilizing the new chassis.<br/><br/>(Is this different from any other game? To me it is, for when I play something like say <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, the rules I apply come from a clear Platonic ideal model of Mountain Witch, built up in my mind out of a singularly clear rules text, plus some experience with the game, iterating upon a perfect and stable form - the same one for everybody who plays the game. With D&amp;D this is not the case; there is no perfect form, there is merely the process applied anew in new situations, with skill being perfected by not so much a mechanical system. Admittedly there are also some historical conventions about stats and classes and levels and so on, too, but those are more of a happenstance or a suggested subject matter for play than rules mechanics per se.)<br/><br/>What I remarked upon about supply logistics rules up there follows from this base strategic nature of the game: as the game asks us to rule freely and rule bravely, but with discipline, it is natural that the rulings we produce reflect the level of play we operate at. As these rulings are further explored, they are elaborated upon; it is the most fundamental error in interpreting D&amp;D, I feel, for someone to take the weapon-against-AC modifier table of AD&amp;D as a foundational rule ex nihilo when it is so very clearly merely an advanced ruling produced by the whim of a particular campaign. Not distinguishing between the thing and the principle of the thing leaves D&amp;D lost in the murk of ever-expanding rules mechanization, with no guarantee of the utility of the whole.<br/><br/>Thus, regarding armies on the march, I feel that the same principle holds to some degree: if we refuse to assign authority to that AC modifier table because it is merely a reportage out of somebody else's campaign, about ideas they found useful... why would we not do the same when it comes to some supply logistics rules? There are reasons to read those rules, yes (inspiration, ideas, perspectives) - but I don't think that there are necessarily good reasons to adopt them wholesale when you could be exploring the game space yourself with your friends to produce your own rulings.<br/><br/>(I thought that this topic sounded familiar - <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/adept/index.php?topic=63.msg579#msg579" rel="nofollow">here's what I wrote about it at Ron's forum a while back</a>.

I'm sensing that my window of inspiration for writing that D&amp;D book might be passing, but who knows what'll happen in the future.\n<blockquote>While I love the way you play D&amp;D (which is, to the best of my ability, now the way I play D&amp;D) I still find myself struggling with two practical points: not asking the right questions, and not easily coming to rulings. <br/><br/>I'm never quite sure how to express a ruling ("You have a 1-in-6 chance of falling," "You fall if you fail a DEX save," "Given what we understand about your character's weight and strength, I'd say he has a minute before he falls.") - do you have any thoughts on how I can be a better principled DM?</blockquote>\nI'd say that buying into the basic mechanical philosophy of the campaign is important in developing rulings: you can only be consistent if you appreciate and enjoy your past rulings as a body of law. A GM who rules out of fear or love cannot be consistent, for those same emotions won't be present the next time a similar case comes up. A GM who rules because they appreciate the clever and colorful way character intuition provides bonuses to initiative except against demons (who, being outside fate, are invisible to intuition) will be more likely to stick to that rule and apply it even-handedly out of simple enjoyment in seeing the rules flower in play.<br/><br/>There also needs to be ambition in what the system expresses: if you are thirsty for greater heights of performance in certain aspects of the game, you're more likely to commit to the effort of revamping and revising rules systems related to it. For example, if you feel like the game has been failing to express the chaos, fear and pain of subterranean monster combat, perhaps you'll implement new rules for battlefield morale, confusion and fatigue to better drive home these things in the play experience. A GM who is not interested, does not care about the vivid creative experience, will stultify and play their instrument (the rules mechanics) in a lazy and lackluster manner.<br/><br/>As a practical example of what buy-in into the mechanical philosophy of the system means: I've been thinking about what a D&amp;D chassis without any ability scores whatsoever would look like. (That is, otherwise relatively conventional, but elegantly excising the abilities and replacing them with other tools.) This is near opposite to the extremely ability-centered take that I've been predominantly playing in the recent years. Such a system would need to provide the inspiring kernel of character uniqueness in some other manner than the traditional random ability matrix; perhaps characters could have random traits out of some sort of career tables to begin with, sort of like Traveller?<br/><br/>Curiousity you feel towards a mechanical chassis like that ("I wonder if this would make players less anxious about their characters being good enough numerically?") makes you prepare one for play; acceptance of the fundamental propositions ("I need to make this work without smuggling abilities back in!") makes you a powerful interlocutor for the system; understanding it deeply ("This kind of system would treat starting wealth as a trait...") makes you able to create new rulings and expand the system.<br/><br/>Once you have a commitment to a mechanization strategy, it's mostly a matter of applying it consistently, with the occasional hard swerve when you discover that the system is failing you in practical play and needs to be bolstered with an off-the-cuff ruling. For example, is your campaign more of a "roll 1-in-6 to not fall" or a "roll Dex vs. DC 20 to not fall" kind of game? This should be obvious to the GM because they've internalized a mechanical approach that is presumably not just "whatever dice happen to be closest to hand". (Not that your mechanization strategy couldn't be entirely arbitrary like that - it just means that you won't get the beautiful symphony of emergent mechanical play if the game mechanics themselves never suggest anything because they're all just a random grab-bag with no rhyme nor reason.)<br/><br/>Regarding asking the right questions, that seems to me mostly a matter of buy-in into the game the other players are playing. It is difficult to be the challenger and devil's advocate if you do not appreciate and enjoy the antics of the adventurers. Meanwhile, if you appreciate how cool it would be if they could do thing X, you will also generally be capable of asking why such an exploit would not be possible - why doesn't every Joe-NPC off the street do this great thing, why are only the PCs trying it? Ideally, if the players are trying to make piracy a sustainable business on the Baltic Sea, they're doing that in part because the GM has been encouraging them and giving positive signals: yes, yes, I'm entirely on board with you doing this thing, and I shall make you rue the day, for there certainly are interesting challenges and difficulties involved with this direction of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443948/#Comment_443948" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T08:03:12+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  8:03AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The mass combat rules in A Red &amp; Pleasant Land looks to be the big takeaway from that book for me.<br/>I have an idea of replacing the one-column-table in that book with the directed graph from the opening flood in Deep Carbon Observatory, making the battle into some synthesis of both.<br/>The downside is that it requires prep after seeing both sides' forces which to me feels like it might be a bit cheaty.
