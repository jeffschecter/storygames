IIRC players can spend coins in the same conflict, they were gained, so they cannot be spend to automatically negate GM's expense. Furthermore Hope coins are an important resource for the players - due their many different functions.<br/><br/>I use coins to push the players, to force them into stressed positions ... from which the drama gains it intensity, and more importantly allows the players to have the necessary resources to be victorious.

If Despair didn't turn into a benefit for the players by becoming coins of Hope, it would just be a "GM dick move" mechanic.  But because of this, you actually create situations where the player wants to GM to screw with them a little, since they can get some benefit from it.  I sometimes actually lt the Despair build up until a player says "dude, spend them already!"  That's a really clear signal to me, as a GM, that they understand the cycle and flow.<br/><br/>Then man alive, do I spend them.  On that player. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But for those looking at it as a zero-sum game, it isn't quite that.  It's actually one that benefits the PCs over time.  A GM may need to spend more than one coin to color a conflict a certain way -- but it only takes one coin to undo the damage from unwanted Exhaustion or Madness (unless it causing crashing or spanning, of course).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Morten Greis</cite>IIRC players can spend coins in the same conflict, they were gained, so they cannot be spend to automatically negate GM's expense. Furthermore Hope coins are an important resource for the players - due their many different functions.</blockquote>\nThe color still happens, though you might quickly buy off the after-effects.  Only the GM can affect Domination -- similarly, only the PCs can affect success with coins.<br/><br/>Also consider unity or division -- anyone can use Hope coins.  If I spend Despair to make Exhaustion dominate, and you're now at 5 Exhaustion, sure, you could spend it -- if someone else doesn't to get their Madness Response checks down from 3 to 2.  Unity -- you could work together, as a group, to allocate the silver lining of being screwed with.  Division -- you could simple take, screwing over other people.  This mechanic really highlights the social interactions at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133538/#Comment_133538" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T21:43:00+00:00" title="March  8, 2008  9:43PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coins are great.
