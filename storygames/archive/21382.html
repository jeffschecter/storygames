I'm new here, so let me know what I'm doing wrong XD<br/><br/>Prompt is a roleplaying game focussing on characters and how they are changed by their experiences.<br/>The players have full control over who their characters are, and what they try to do. For everything else\u2014from the overall storyline to what obstacles the characters are faced with, to even how the characters are affected what happens\u2014prompts are generated which provide obstacles, story and structure.<br/><br/>This is the third draft of the rules after a few test games.

This game in part came from my understanding of how RPGs work in general: the system (including die rolls, outcome tables, etc.) tells you what kind of thing happened (success/failure, etc.) and then the GM interprets it and describes what actually happens to the players.<br/><br/>So a big thing behind Prompt is taking that idea and exposing it to the players; you are taking prompts and turning them into story. So while most RPGs have the GM figure out the story and world beforehand, even that stuff is done using the system. If your group likes these more freeform GM-less storytelling games (thinking of Microscope), then they won't mind all pitching in ideas. If your group prefers a more traditional GM-ed format, then the GM can use it to generate the story and world beforehand.<br/><br/>Maybe there is room for improvement, though. If you have any specific ideas on what could be cut, or how things could be sped up I'd be interested to hear them. In the meantime I'll compare to Primetime; maybe that'll help me understand where you're coming from.<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>...characters are dropped in a vacuum.... more navigation tools.</p></div></blockquote>\nI'm not 100% clear on what you mean by these notes.

I get a lot of comments on the generation side of things, but not a lot on the moment-to-moment gameplay stuff. So thanks for that! ^^<br/><br/>As for making them into tables, there are more terse versions in the "playing sheets" document, where it's all a lot easier to glance at and find the right one you need.

There's a lot of good stuff in here, and some things which might need ironing out. (I think your general insight concerning RPG game design which sparked this is entirely correct, by the way.)<br/><br/>The text lacks orientation a little bit, which I noted in a comment within the document - that wouldn't be hard to fix. It's not easy to get a sense of gameplay by reading the document, which is likely losing you readers. There's a clear sense of enthusiasm, which is nice, but it reads like someone talking about something they're already familiar with instead of starting from the beginning.<br/><br/>How many other collaborative storytelling RPGs are you familiar with? There are a few elements of your design which suggest to me that you might benefit from looking at what else exists in the field. (If I'm entirely wrong, I apologize; but that's the sense I get from the text.)<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>Is rolling dice to determine whether "a character can do something difficult" really the most interesting prompt for storytelling? How do we decide if something is difficult? If we roll a low number, did the "difficult" thing actually become easy? (For instance, if I roll a "1" for the Opposition, then success will be automatic, won't it? If so, haven't I just totally undermined a potentially dramatic moment in the story?)<br/><br/>Why is the distinction between Active and Passive opposition necessary? What does it add to the game? (Mathematically they seem almost identical.)<br/><br/>I agree with DeReel's comment about "characters being dropped in a vacuum": the Frames are a great tool to describe the characters, but then we don't get any orientation about what situation they find themselves in, how they might relate to each other, and so forth. That means that we have to come up with all that stuff on the spot, when we start a scene (and, without it, how do we even decide which characters are present in the scene, in the first place?), and therefore we might fall prey to "terrible cliches" like everyone meeting in a tavern.<br/><br/>There are lots of interesting ideas here, and I think it's well worth polishing this game up and taking it to the next step. My guess is that looking at some other existing games in the genre might inspire you a great deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468130/#Comment_468130" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-02T12:06:10+00:00" title="December  2, 2017 12:06PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: Thanks for the comments! ANd for reading it in the first place. ^^<br/><br/>I've only played Microscope so far, actually. And that's so completely different it's not really that useful to compare to, I fear. My group is generally more into regular D&amp;D and other more classical-style games. They hated Microscope, which was a delightful experience... ;/<br/><br/>I've tried one of them in GM-less mode, but he found it too taxing to be creative and such. I'm going to be playtesting Prompt DM'd, and by generating a story <i>beforehand</i> to make gameplay smoother for them on the night. Not ideal, but it should focus on testing the actual gameplay without worrying about generation in the moment.<br/><br/>The problem I worry about with looking at other RPGs is that most story games are in the business of producing certain kinds of characters in certain kinds of worlds going through certain kinds of stories. Prompt is intended to be a lot more open in those regards, so it wouldn't be possible to focus in on a tone/genre--like Fiasco, for example. Are there any somewhat similar games you'd recommend? Any free ones out there I can peruse?<br/><br/><b>Is rolling dice to determine whether "a character can do something difficult" really the most interesting prompt for storytelling?</b> Not sure what you mean. Most games are "roll when something's difficult," aren't they? In D&amp;D you don't need to roll to walk, but you do need to roll to climb a wall.<br/><br/><b>Characters are dropped in a vacuum.</b> The first scene will always be setting up the rest of the game. Each Thread comes with an initial situation to get that part of the story going. So the first scene will purely be to establish that thread. And some of the story elements created beforehand should be important to that first situation. I've added the following section to the Create a Scene section (was always meant to be there, but forgot to add it in):\n<blockquote><b>The First Scene</b><br/><br/>The first scene of the game shouldn\u2019t be rolled for. Use the game\u2019s story elements and the Thread\u2019s initial situation to begin the scene. You won\u2019t close this thread in the initial scene; you\u2019ll simply establish the overall Thread itself. (eg. \u201cSo we\u2019re playing a Question Thread from the start. We find a body! We go to the Haunted Castle for the family reunion, and find Mrs. Mulgrew dead on the table with an apple in her mouth. (All story elements.) Whodunnit?!\u201d)<br/><br/>All characters must be in this scene, and are all considered main characters. They won\u2019t Roll Arcs, and you don\u2019t need to write down each of their names.<br/></blockquote>\nHow they relate to each other is covered at the start, in the initial discussion. It's part of what helps the players create their characters. They wouldn't start all just hanging out in a tavern unless the story itself starts there. These stories are never some bloke gives you a quest. The characters <i>themselves</i> have a Question, or get stuck in a Place, or a big Event happens around them that they have to deal with. So classic RPG tropes shouldn't turn up unless the players specifically want to go that route.<br/><br/>I've added some of those other questions in to relevant sections of the doc, along with my responses and further questions of my own. I'd be grateful if we could continue the discussion there for those points...<br/><br/>Thanks for your help so far!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468136/#Comment_468136" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-02T16:07:47+00:00" title="December  2, 2017  4:07PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this game, too. <br/>rolling against difficulty is not something I like about RPGs.

And that's where the surprise comes from; the randomness.<br/><br/>The story generation side gives you a high-level structure to the narrative, but you find out what happens beat-to-beat by taking actions and rolling dice and introducing new Opposition, etc. It is those interactions which affect the characters going through it, and change them as people.<br/><br/>Or is that what you said anyway? <img alt=":confused:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":confused:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468138/#Comment_468138" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-02T18:12:54+00:00" title="December  2, 2017  6:12PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2017 8:55PM by DeReel.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry I was not superclear to say the least.<br/>You can use rolls so that what happens is not in your hands or to represent some statistical reality of the world. I like the first but the second usually yields excitement.<br/><br/>In your game you use both : you roll to come up with scenes, ideas, patterns, etc. And you also roll to decide for success or failure. <br/><br/>There is tension when rolling for frames. Not so when rolling for scenes. And more so when rolling for success.<br/><br/>"Maybe you don't need randomness" to determine success. Maybe all you need from this outcome roll is the tension. There could be another mechanism that "loads/unloads dramatic tension". I am not saying that the roll doesn't work, just stating my preferences : roll against difficulty is something I actively try to avoid. This mechanism should gravitate around what may be the theme of your game : resilience. <br/><br/>Another idea : character change could be more like in Awkward : a final breakthrough from the character who overcomes a trauma. Not a side effect.<br/><br/>Don't think you need to change the game. In my experience, when people tegin to tell you the story could go that way or that way it means they are already invested in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468139/#Comment_468139" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-02T19:47:12+00:00" title="December  2, 2017  7:47PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have a great deal of free time just now to go into details, tapgiles, but here's the short version:<br/><br/>1. There are a LOT of games out there which have tackled these design problems in variant ways. Do some research! There are good articles, free games, and videos, podcasts, and panel discussions which have great info. People on this forum are generally really knowledgeable and helpful, too.<br/><br/>A really easy and accessible example is the Tabletop Fiasco episode, which is a YouTube video. It's a very freeform game, but you can see a good story in action with very little die-rolling (and none at all to resolve challenges to the characters in a random fashion).<br/><br/>A few other really interesting games to explore might include <i>Imagine</i>, <i>The Quiet Year</i>, <i>Archipelago</i>, and <i>While the World Ends</i>.<br/><br/>Two games I would *really* encourage you to check out would be <i>Dog Eat Dog</i> and <i>Fall of Magic</i>.<br/><br/>The former uses a clever and simple system of tokens and "rules" to create a powerful dynamic tension between the players and characters. (Don't be thrown off by the "conflict resolution" rules in the game; they rarely come into play - it's the Rules which actually drive the story and determine the outcomes.) The latter uses a visual map and vague prompts to create a story (without die-rolling for success and failure at all) in a very powerful way, too.<br/><br/>2. Traditional RPGs were all basically formed in the "adventure game" vein, where a group of skilled "adventurers" are put up against challenges they must overcome.<br/><br/>For this reason (and others), the game rules were formed around characters using their abilities to overcome challenges, which usually involved some balance of player cleverness and die-rolling/application of character abilities.<br/><br/>However, if you think about it, "a group of characters applying their abilities to overcome physical (generally) challenges" is a terrible fit for most kinds of storytelling. <br/><br/>Your game has some great insights into storytelling, like characters being based on formative experiences and relationships, and their capabilities changing based on how things go for them at important moments in the story, but also seems to be heavily influenced by D&amp;D in other ways. (Do those formative experiences have to translate directly into success rates at physical challenges, for instance? Maybe they do; but do consider other options, too.)<br/><br/>3. In terms of your text conveying gameplay better, I'd recommend you keep reaching out to people (perhaps just with short chunks) and have them summarize what they're reading back to you. Repeat until you're sure you're getting the right message across.<br/><br/>Your writing is good, but it feels a little like you're presenting the information in the wrong order a little bit (as you can see by several readers now being confused by various aspects of the larger picture).<br/><br/>I'll send you a private message with something, as well. <br/><br/>I think your game has serious promise!

I play lots of GMless games so maybe I can recommend some to take a look at if I think it could help you. I haven\u2019t looked at your game yet but based on Paul\u2019s comment and the context...<br/>\u201cIs rolling dice to determine whether "a character can do something difficult" really the most interesting prompt for storytelling?\u201d<br/>...I would say that the design choice Paul mentioned almost certainly isn\u2019t the right direction to go to hit your design goals. Again, I haven\u2019t read the game so I may be wrong, but that\u2019s the impression I get.

The thing is, tension comes from not knowing. And rolling a die gives you that in a straightforward way. So I don't mind that at all.<br/><br/>As for making opposed rolls (both sides roll, side that's higher than the other wins), I don't mind them either. While I like the idea of things like Dungeon World, where everything's just a roll by the player, it seems to me like if you have a higher stat you're more likely to win--regardless of what you're up against. So then you're just rolling a die to see what happens rather than being better at a thing making you better equipped to deal with a tougher obstacle.<br/><br/>I dunno... Your view is fair enough, but I just don't share it, I guess ^^<br/><br/>I'm not sure my game is about resilience. What do you mean by that?<br/><br/>Is "Awkward" the name of an RPG? I can't find it anywhere. Sounds interesting, though! My idea for character development is that people slowly change over time based on their experiences. So it's not so much about "getting over" a past trauma, as the way you see that trauma--and the beliefs it instilled in you--change over time. While a Frame can change drastically, it still all stems from that same trauma. For better or worse, it'll affect you for the rest of your life. The key is to turn it into a positive--which isn't really in your hands, in this game at least. ^^<br/><br/>Thanks again for your help!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468145/#Comment_468145" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-03T12:04:40+00:00" title="December  3, 2017 12:04PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: Thanks for giving me more feedback!<br/><br/>1. I have seen that episode of Tabletop, and considered playing Fiasco myself. Though I think the design goals are a little different for Prompt. A key factor I want to have is that you never know what's going to happen. In Fiasco, as far as I understand it, you just do a thing and it's done. If you shoot a guy, that guy gets shot. There are no misfires, there are no ricochets into a bystander.<br/><br/>Prompt has rolls for actions because that way we <i>find out</i> if we're successful, and what repercussions come as a result. While I would like to find other RPGs that have this sort of story game, without being tied to a particular kind of story, and with actual dice rolling for outcomes... it seems hard to find them. In my (admittedly limited) experience, with story games it seems if you play a character then the world/tone/general setup is dictated by the game, and if you get to make your own world and story then character control isn't really featured.<br/><br/>Seems like most games are either roll-em-up traditional RPGs or talk-em-up storytelling RPGs (and both are great, by the way). I guess I'm trying to straddle a line that is hard to straddle?<br/><br/>I will check out the ones you suggested, though. Thanks for those suggestions!<br/><br/>2. Thanks for your kind words.<br/><br/>I think the idea was that if you're in the wrong headspace, you suck at doing pretty much anything. ;D So if you're cornered with no way out, and you just want to run away and hide with your +1 Shy, it'll be difficult for you to fight back and escape in the first place. And if you need to jump a huge gap between buildings that you're unlikely to make, you may well make it with your +6 Determination.<br/><br/>I am aware it's a somewhat warped reality within the story. Theoretically, you could crush a planet with your pinky if someone's belittling you and you have +6 Defensive. XD Or, you know, more reasonable examples... At the same time, I guess that's kind of along the lines of stories in general. The good guy wins in the end. And here, he wins because in his head, he can win.<br/><br/>Maybe it's a game about self-confidence? If you're confident in your ability to do a thing, you can probably do it. Hrm...<br/><br/>I think the problem is, the characters need to go through specific new events and hardships to grow as people. To slowly overcome a flaw or the past trauma, they have to be living inside that trauma (in that Frame) and overcome it by succeeding <i>despite</i> it. That's the idea behind the Development mechanic. But for that to ring true, they have to be able to actually overcome things while in that frame of mind. And to me, that means they have to succeed at an action by rolling using that Frame.<br/><br/>Maybe I'll have more ideas after reading some of those other RPGs. For now, I kinda like the excitement and tension of rolling dice while at the same time considering what's happening inside the character's head.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks for your help, Paul! I am going to go through the rules soon and improve the intros to each section as well as the start with more on when and why certain mechanics will be used.<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468146/#Comment_468146" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-03T12:05:09+00:00" title="December  3, 2017 12:05PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>: Will do.

It would be more of a story game in GM-less mode. At the moment though, playing it here and there with my regular group as a GM, it certainly plays more like an adventure game, I guess. According to his definition, anyway.<br/><br/>I think it may just be a problem in the wording of that line: "determine whether a character can do something difficult." It makes it sound like the "stats" are your ability to do a particular thing, perhaps. But as I said in another reply above, the stats are more about what's going on in your head than your physical aptitude to perform a given task.

If that's what you want for your game, it's fine. It's just a sort of a default assumption in a lot of games of this sort (I.e.

It's providing unpredictability, which is desired and good.

It sounds like you might be trying to straddle the line between Dramatism and Simulationism (in the Threefold Model sense), which is a difficult space to design well in; especially, if you haven\u2019t been exposed to many games in that design space...<br/>If this is what you are trying to do, you might want to check out:<br/><b>Polaris</b> (the indie one)<br/><b>Remember Tomorrow</b> <br/>Different types of Powered by the Apocalypse games, like <b>Apocalypse World</b> etc.\u2014after checking out a couple you might want to take a look at <b>The Veil</b> because its resolution mechanic is based on the PCs inner emotional state, which is similar to what your attempting<br/><b>Sins of the Father</b><br/><b>Fate Core</b><br/><b>Shock: Social Science Fiction</b> <br/><b>In a Wicked Age</b><br/>And other games that straddle the line in some way; also, IMO it just as important to read the books listed below\u2014especially, since you haven\u2019t been exposed too much to the GMless collaborative Story Game space. <br/><br/>If you are trying to go in a more Dramatist \u201cStory Game\u201d direction read these:<br/><b>Fiasco</b> (its narrative mechanic is actually very powerful when employed correctly; it\u2019s hard to see the nuts and bolts of it in the YouTube video you watched) <br/><b>Archipelago</b> <br/><b>Hillfolk</b> and DramaSystem Games generally <br/><b>Follow</b><br/><b>Dog Eat Dog</b><br/><b>Montsegur 1244</b><br/><b>Fall of Magic</b> <br/><b>Kingdom</b><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b><br/>Basically, just read a bunch of indie \u201cStory Games,\u201d and this will give you some inspiration and an idea of what may be possible in the space.<br/><br/>You have some interesting and creative ideas, which I really like. One thing you\u2019re lacking, which could help a lot, is a broader understanding of the RPG design space your designing in. So my advice would be to read lots of indie RPGs and to talk to people on these forums who are very informed about design. Both Paul and Tod\u2019s advice and suggestions above are solid. I think if you keep working on your ideas, read and play lots of indie games, and learn from the folks on this forum that you have a good chance of shaping this into something really cool. I really like the direction your ideas are taking but I think you need a bit more context. If you want to list your specific design goals, I will make a list of the RPGs that I think would give you the most insight to read.

I was hoping to give you an idea of some different directions you might take. For example, there is a difference between a game that uses a character stat and die roll to determine what a character can do and a game that doesn\u2019t. Is a character stat plus a die roll the best way to direct the narrative of your game or to decide what a character can and can\u2019t do in the narrative, or is it just something your used to doing? You've said that you like the \u2018tension\u2019 that comes from the roll, but there may be other methods that would better fit your design goals that would still provide that tension. I don\u2019t know, but it might be worth checking out a game that handles it differently from mainstream RPGs just to see the difference.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468157/#Comment_468157" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-03T23:15:41+00:00" title="December  3, 2017 11:15PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" rel="nofollow">tapgiles</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Is "Awkward" the name of an RPG?

But not necessarily for other games. I'd go with something like "Story game mechanics produce stories, adventure game mechanics produce adventures." You get story in D&amp;D by adding it yourself, beyond the rules. You get adventure (combat, levelling up, loot) in story games by adding it yourself, beyond the rules.<br/><br/>/shrug/ Though I find the idea of "defining" genres of any kind a tad pointless. The only use for genres is so people can find more material of a similar nature to what they already know--an inclusionary method to add more to your collection of "likes." But the only use for definitions is to be able to point at a thing and say "that's one" or "that's not one"--an exclusionary method to reject things that don't belong. But that doesn't help people find more material they may like, so it doesn't tend to mesh very well with genres.<br/><br/>Anyway. That's my piece said. ^^<br/><br/>Regarding unpredictability vs randomness... others have mentioned similar, but I confess I am at a loss. ...Mr. Darcy. I mean, if just the rules create the "unpredictability" is it not inherently predictable? You have to go through the steps to find the answer, so you could go through the steps in your head beforehand. So to have something unpredictable, the interactions between rules have to be complex enough that you couldn't make those calculations in your head.<br/><br/>We call this phenomenon "randomness." A roll of the dice uses the "physics" ruleset, the rules of which interact in a sufficiently complex manner as to be incalculable by humans. (Or shuffling a deck of cards, etc.)<br/><br/>Could you give a couple of simple examples of non-random but unpredictable mechanics, just so I can get past this question of "what's everyone talking about?" and get on with actually trying things out?

Thanks for helping out!<br/><br/>I think I've come to the conclusion that that is what I'm trying to do. Of course, I've been thinking in terms of "Complex characters that change, stories that have interesting interweaving arcs and satisfying conclusions, and mechanics that build and reflect all the above." But I guess the way I've gone about accomplishing that is to be half narrativist and half simulationist. (If I understand simulationist correctly.)<br/><br/>I'll look into those when I have the time. So many to look at now, though XD<br/><br/>I've listened to a whole ton of Friends at the Table, who largely use Apocalypse games. So I understand the basics of the gameplay itself, if not the ins and outs of the rules themselves. And I have read the one-shot demo of The Veil, too (and it was before I made mine, so perhaps I was influenced to some degree).<br/><br/>With The Veil, I think the way the emotions escalate and boil over is pretty awesome! But for me, that doesn't necessarily make interesting characters. I guess I might have come at it from the other side. Instead of starting with roleplay (the emotion stats) and working back, I started with the characters. They create <i>their own</i> stats, effectively, based on big shaping events in their lives. So character creation affects their ability to act, the way they roleplay, their inner conflict, their development as a person, and is reflected in the world and events around them--further pushing them to reflect on themselves and to change from the inside out.<br/><br/>"I'm joyful" works fine, but it takes a bit of thinking about to figure out what that means in the context. If you're fighting some goons, and feel Joyful... you're probably a psychopath. XD<br/><br/>I do see the similarities, though; so it's a fair suggestion. ^^<br/><br/>I've played a few games of FAE (running them, specifically). And I also took inspiration from that--the Aspects and Approaches morphed into my Frames and tied closer to the character's personality. Though that had no clear worldbuilding and dramatic character mechanics. I think my main issue playing it was while the 4 moves could <i>conceivably</i> be used for things other than combat... they're called "Attack" and "Defend" for a reason. And the way you build things up to getting a big hit in was really clever! Though for my tastes it was a bit too technical and tactical. Maybe that's the difficulty with "straddle" games--it's hard to get the balance right for everyone playing. And if someone wants one or the other, they're going to dislike it no matter what you do.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just making a game <i>I</i> want to play. ;P Of course, I'm trying to make it fun for others. But it's not always easy to find people IRL to play with that understand where you're coming from. Time and playtesting will tell...<br/><br/>Friends at the Table have also done some Patreon-exclusive playthroughs of other story games, Fiasco included. I did get a much better idea of how things work by listening to that, though I know I should probably just get on and read it sometime. XD<br/><br/>I've also seen/heard actual plays of Kingdom and Dogs in the Vineyard. Very interesting games. But there are too many games I've got to read, now! Yeesh! ;P<br/><br/>Thanks for your help, and more to add to the list though. Much appreciated. And thanks for the offer; I'll come back to the forum now and then to post my progress, I'm sure ^^<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468184/#Comment_468184" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-04T15:07:20+00:00" title="December  4, 2017  3:07PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a>: No worries. It was an interesting read, either way.<br/><br/>I think what I'm looking for is:<br/><br/>- Character creation that is about how a person is "created," what makes them who they are. Actual creation of a character. Rather than the D&amp;D-style stats and predefined ways to interact with the world.<br/><br/>- A system that will allow the GM (when playing GM'd) to not have to worry about what kind of thing should happen next and how to make it important to the characters. Just roll some dice and you've got a prompt of how to proceed, with character engagement baked in.<br/><br/>- But I'm not generally a fan of players overriding the story to bend it to their will. (I'm looking at you, Fate Points!)<br/><br/>I guess I just want a game that has more to character creation and worldbuilding than "you're allowed to be good at strong-ing things to death" and "buy an adventure or make something up, and stop complaining." (None of that was targeted at anyone, by the way; just at the RPGs I get frustrated with. ^^)<br/><br/>So while reality is bent a little, to make a person's frame of mind more important than their physical strength to bust open a door... I don't want the players directly manipulating the story itself to make things interesting or dramatic in their own view. I'd like to have the game's story generation mechanics to make it inherently dramatic no matter what the characters do. (As long as there's some amount of investment from the players, which should be helped by the character creation.)<br/><br/>I don't really know if roll+attribute is just what I'm used to or not at this stage. I have had a brushing knowledge of a decent number of story games through podcasts and Youtube series and such. I'm not saying I'm experienced, by any means... but from the numerous ways of handling conflict I have basic knowledge of, rolling dice doesn't seem to be too far off, for now. I'll know more after my coming playtest, but so far it doesn't seem to mess up the narrative. Even when I think before a roll "Oh, it would be cool if I succeeded; then this happened..." after the roll I tend to think "Oh, man! I failed? This leaves it wide open! So <i>this</i> happens instead. This is awesome! Where's it all going to lead?!" (Sorry for bigging up my own game, there... XD)<br/><br/>But as you say, more knowledge of what's out there is always a good thing. I'll slowly work through the different works you and others have listed for me. And maybe I'll try out different resolution mechanics along the way ^^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468185/#Comment_468185" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-04T15:08:03+00:00" title="December  4, 2017  3:08PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a>: Shameless plug accepted. ^^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468186/#Comment_468186" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-04T15:20:38+00:00" title="December  4, 2017  3:20PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: I've actually read the basic rules for their demo one-shot thing. (And I've listened to Friends at the Table play it a bit.) It did sound intriguing (and I'm sure I was inspired by some of it in early drafts of Prompt). But my slight issue with it is the pause thinking.<br/><br/>In the heat of the moment, you're <i>feeling</i> those things already. When roleplaying the character, you've already got the emotion fixed in your head. But it's not that easy to put it into words. And then look it up on the emotion wheel. And then classify it as something that doesn't really capture what you're actually feeling. It takes a long time to figure out in some cases, and instead of helping roleplay seems to interrupt it while you put your psychologists hat on.<br/><br/>Bear in mind I've never played it, but that was the impression I got from reading the basic rules and the actual play.<br/><br/>I'm hoping the difference with Prompt is in how the "stats" are made. The player comes up with a specific event with a few vivid details to lock it in, notes down the new belief that stuck with them from that moment, then envisions a situation where that experience moves them to act, then notes down a single word to capture that frame of mind.<br/><br/>So when roleplaying, they have beliefs to riff off of. And when acting (making rolls), they've already decided why their character is doing the thing, so they look over the few words for the one that they already have in their head, and add that number.<br/><br/><i>Hopefully</i> it'll all go very smooth with this latest draft. (There were issues with the way Frames were thought about and created previously, but it should be fixed now.)<br/><br/>The Veil definitely had some impact on how I thought about RPGs and what they can do, depending on the mechanics, though.

I'm not necessarily recommending it as a model, as a result of that. However, if a game does something similar to what you're going for, you should check it out - you'll either learn what to do or you'll learn what NOT to do, and both are equally useful.<br/><br/>On unpredictable vs. random:<br/><br/>DeReel puts it nicely, above. Another example is blind bidding. A third example is card selection in my game Musette (which you now have) - there is no randomness there (at least potentially; depending on whether anyone draws from the deck), but no one knows what the outcome will be. <br/><br/>Having the rules simply dictate which player decides, and then giving players complex or hidden motives to do so, is another useful technique.<br/><br/>Personally, my "sweet spot" lies in a space where players get a lot of input into what *possible* outcomes there are, and then a bit of randomness injects a touch of unpredictability. Here's an example of a simple illustration of that idea:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20681/burned-at-the-stake-rpg-ruleset-for-passionate-characters-at-risk" rel="nofollow">Burned at the Stake (rule add-on/mini-system)</a><br/><br/>When it comes to a "story game", what's the purpose of one or the other?<br/><br/>Unpredictability is good if you want the story to be surprising to everyone. It's bad if you want to be able to craft something carefully from start to finish (e.g. foreshadowing a future event throughout play).<br/><br/>Randomness can serve this well in some contexts. For instance, if your game IS about success and failure in challenging contexts, and you want the outcomes to be unpredictable, randomness is great.<br/><br/>However, note that you do NOT use randomness in the way Frames shift and change as a result of success and failure. Here, you use a predictable rule, instead - e.g. success increases your Frame (if I remember correctly). That's because you want the game's rules to take a definite stand on this issue: you want things to go a certain way reliably, because it creates a certain dynamic and underlines a certain theme.<br/><br/>For comparison, in a typical "adventure game", success and failure is often a question of luck: are the dice good to you tonight? That creates a nice feeling, like gambling. In my ruleset (linked above), there is still luck involved, but less so - you get to decide, to a large extent, what your odds will be like. Instead, the game asks, "How much is this worth to you? How much are you willing to put on the line to have a good shot at success here?"<br/><br/>A good example of a long-time debate over randomness and unpredictability is character death in RPGs. Do we allow it? Do we make it unpredictable? Random? Both?<br/><br/>In old-school D&amp;D, character death is highly random and unpredictable. This is reflected in both the rules (e.g. hit points) and other aspects of design (like adventure design with lots of deathtraps).<br/><br/>In some "story games", we remove unpredictability, and just say, "the characters can't die". Often, that's the right call for those games.<br/><br/>Other games find interesting compromises or halfway positions. For instance, in the ruleset I linked to, you cannot control when you die; but you DO control when you *might* die. This means that death will be unpredictable, to a large extent, but will never happen at an unwelcome moment in the game - we can always choose whether to put it on the table or take it off the table, as it suits our story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468193/#Comment_468193" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-04T18:42:10+00:00" title="December  4, 2017  6:42PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's Prompt's hottest features are the way Frames form characters, and the way they shift based on the action of the game. That's great stuff (and the latter reminds me a bit of Dogs in the Vineyards' fallout for character growth).<br/><br/>These are great because they clearly feed into the goals of the game - evolving, interesting, compelling characters.<br/><br/>Perhaps the randomized Threads et al. are also a hot feature; I couldn't quite fully make sense of how they actually work in the text. (A couple of examples would probably help here.)<br/><br/>Frames turning into odds for success, and rolling for those odds when characters attempt challenging tasks, though (and perhaps some of the other stuff you've been asked about in this discussion or in the comments on the document) don't seem to have as much to do with evolving, interesting, compelling characters.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean it's the wrong choice for your game - it might be exactly what you want and need - but it means that you haven't made it clear to your readers WHY they are exactly the right choice. That's why people (I think) are asking you to dig a little deeper and either change it or explain it better.<br/><br/>Why is the random outcome given challenging character tasks important to this kind of game/story? (For instance; there may be similar questions to consider for other design specs.)<br/><br/>Finally, we've recommended a lot of games with collaborative GMless procedures, which make everyone into story creators. If your game wants to hew closer to standard RPG play, you might be better off looking at more traditional game formats. <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> is a really important game to be aware of, for instance - check out the way "Keys" in that game inform characters, plot, and character evolution over time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468194/#Comment_468194" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-04T22:14:47+00:00" title="December  4, 2017 10:14PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Tagpiles, I read through your game and thought about it a bit.  I also went through the first few steps as a solo game to see how it worked.  Like you, I haven't played that many story games (I have played more traditional D&amp;D-type stuff), so you can take my thoughts as the perspective of a novice trying to understand your game.<br/><br/>Frames: I was initially confused when I got to this part, although I understood it after rereading it a couple times.  I think you should emphasize first that a frame represents a frame of mind, described by a single word, before you start talking about its mechanical role.<br/><br/>The order in which the steps are performed to generate a frame is a little confusing:<br/> 1. Roll a number<br/> 2. Think of an event that caused you to change in such a way that you would perform well/badly in a certain frame of mind.<br/> 3. Choose what the frame of mind is.<br/><br/>This process seems awkward because the number refers to how you perform in the state of mind, but you don't choose the state of mind until after choosing the event.<br/><br/>Probably there is a better way you could explain the process, to make it easier to understand.  Something along the lines of:<br/> 1. Roll a number<br/> 2. Think of an event from your past that had a positive/negative (based on the number) impact on your development<br/> 3. Choose a frame of mind that reflects the event<br/><br/>Alternatively, it could even be interesting to alter the order of the steps.<br/> 1. Think of an important event from your past.<br/> 2. Roll a number.<br/> 3. Choose a frame of mind that reflects the event and the number.<br/><br/>For example, say I chose the event "my brother locked me in the cupboard".  Then after the roll, it might turn out to be +5, in which case it means that I learned from the experience and grew stronger.  "Independent."  Or it might turn out to be +2, which means I was traumatized by the experience and grew weaker.  "Isolated."<br/><br/>Rolling arcs: This dice mechanic is awkward.  For example, if I have two frames with the same value, they will always both occur together.  And it might be tedious rerolling if I don't roll numbers that correspond to my frames.  Maybe there is some other way that we could choose which frame words to use.  For example, you could put them each on a card and draw a certain number for each scene.<br/><br/>"Turn each word into a story element (more on this below)."  This is an example of poor organization.  The instructions should be presented in the same order that I need to perform them.<br/> - I didn't realize at first that "word" here means "frame".  This also confused me because I thought the words were coming from somewhere else (e.g., a random table).  But I see now that the point is that you take inspiration by re-interpreting the frame words.<br/><br/>"Write the selected Thread\u2019s type down (eg. \u201cPlace\u201d rather than the whole description), and a note about the specifics of what it means to your particular story. (eg. \u201cWho killed Mrs. Pettigrew?\u201d)"<br/> - It says to write down the specifics of what it means to the story, but I wasn't sure how I would know this.  I guess what you mean is that we should stop and have a discussion, and then we all agree on a place/question/event we want to explore (within the story we agreed on earlier).  Then we write it down.<br/><br/>"Turning Words into Narrative.  This is really the crux of the game: taking a words and a Thread, and turning it all into scenes and NPCs and elements within the world.  ... You can do this however you wish, using any methods or criteria you come up with."<br/> - Here, I felt like I wanted more guidance.  The next few paragraphs do offer some techniques, which is good.  But I am still not sure what I am trying to come up with.  I guess I am meant to come up with one scene, NPC, or element per prompt (rolled frame word)?  The earlier instructions said not to decide too many details in advance, because some of it was supposed to be generated later by the game.  Is this that point when we should be trying to decide a lot of details?  Or is it still supposed to be open-ended at this point?<br/><br/>A lot of the instructions do not provide enough guidance for me to know how I would play the game.  For example, you can make up a villain, or not.  You can make up some opposition, or not.  How do I know how many oppositions we should make before the start of the scene?<br/><br/>I wonder if this could be streamlined together with the part about choosing thread.  For example, maybe when you roll up a "Place", that comes with two NPCs, two scenes, a villain, and two pieces of opposition.  And then for each of those elements, you select a random frame to provide a prompt.  Something like that would make it easier for me to play the game, even though it would make it less open-ended.<br/><br/>Conflict resolution mechanics: One technical question I have here is what do you do if none of your frames apply to a situation?  Are the frames meant to span all possible situations?  This seems unlikely.  Do I add nothing (making it worse than a negative frame)?  Do I generate a new frame on the spot?<br/><br/>I think in general, the game text would be stronger if it were more decisive.  The book describes a lot of different things you *could* do, but it would be more valuable to me as a new player to have a really clear description of one specific way to play the game.  Probably this should be the way that you play it with your home group, since this will be the most concrete!  Then I could read the clear description and see in my mind exactly what the game would be like.<br/><br/>You could still have a section at the end about variations and alternatives, which would be easier to understand and more interesting once I understood the "standard" way to play the game.<br/><br/>The overall ideas of the game (exploring how frames of mind affects behaviour, and using free association to invent thematically relevant story elements) certainly seem promising, but the game mechanics seem a little muddy at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468195/#Comment_468195" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-04T22:14:50+00:00" title="December  4, 2017 10:14PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2017 10:55PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The last two posts of Paul\u2019s (11:35 &amp; 11:42) are absolutely excellent <a href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">@tapgiles</a> so I would really, really pay attention to them. It may be difficult to get everything out of them and appreciate how insightful they are without some more context and exposure to the types of games we\u2019ve been recommending. Thus, the recommended reading. I would save his posts to refer to as you learn more about different design spaces and techniques. I would also recommend that you still look at collaborative games in which players create a shared narrative together; not to change your game to one where players have a bigger role in crafting the larger story, but to look at alternative mechanics and methods of shaping your narrative and character goals\u2014for example, if you wanted to take a look at some alternatives for your task resolution mechanic. Plus, most of those games are short and easy reads. <br/><br/>Usually, when people post their games here they don\u2019t get a ton of feedback. Part of the reason you are getting feedback is because you have some interesting ideas that have potential, like Frames. Which were inspired by <b>Fate</b> mechanics, so\u2014as Paul mentioned\u2014even if a game isn\u2019t the right fit overall doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t provide a lot of dividends. I really think it is worth the time and effort to read some indie games\u2014I can recommend some short, free ones if you\u2019d like\u2014I think they\u2019ll really help you in your design efforts; watching YouTube videos just won\u2019t give you nearly enough insight into the game\u2019s mechanics and procedures. <br/><br/>One of the things you've got going for you is that you are already thinking outside the box and you are open to listening and not putting up walls. When I first discovered these forums I was very closed off and defensive when it came to new ideas. D&amp;D 5e was my favorite game and fantasy was the only genre I was interested in. It\u2019s kind of funny looking back on it, because people in these forums love D&amp;D but any new and different idea felt like a slight to me. Now I love pretty much every genre and play in every RPG design space; although, my tastes have pretty much done a 180\u2014I\u2019m more interested in games with atomized, distributed, or diminished GM authority; games that place an emphasis on collaborative creativity and interaction in which player\u2019s are less reactive and more inventive. I actually feel sorry for my old self and what I was missing, not because mainstream games are bad\u2014they\u2019re not\u2014but just because there was a whole world of amazing games and experiences I was missing. The game I\u2019m currently designing is pretty much the antithesis of what I used to think was my favorite game design space. Anyway, I think that being receptive to new ideas is a very positive trait for a designer to have. Part of innovating comes from building on other ideas and continually asking \u201cwhat-if\u201d in order to break into new territory that does a better job of fulfilling the goals of your game.<br/><br/>Anyway, if I\u2019m giving a lot of advice it\u2019s for selfish reasons <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/>. I\u2019m a game collecting addict and I love new games and new designs, etc., so I\u2019m usually interested in whatever folks are designing. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how your game will ultimately shape up <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>Finally, you might watch some of Jason Morningstar\u2019s YouTube videos in which he discusses design; they are very accessible and excellent. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468201/#Comment_468201" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-05T00:16:37+00:00" title="December  5, 2017 12:16AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And yes, your <i>Awkward</i>, Rafu.

I think non-random resolution can work for those more high-level things. But right now I kinda like finding out if a single action works or not. Because it's more low-level, it can send the whole line of the story in an unexpected direction. I can't think of a way of getting that without the players (or GM) directly competing against one another by pushing things towards success or failure.

I agree, it is good to bounce other games' ideas off your own.<br/><br/><b>Regarding unpredictability</b>: I can see now how it can be done. But there are a couple of problems I'm having with it. They're touched on in the comment I just made, above.<br/><br/>I like having low-level actions succeed or fail, because it can drastically affect the route a PC takes to overcome a problem, and so affect the whole story; and I'm not sure how more low-level stuff would be done without simple randomness.<br/><br/>But also, I guess I'm just not sure on why randomness is less good/useful/enjoyable to play with than a thing that's technically not random but feels just as random. Won't it have the exact same feel in play?<br/><br/>Still hazy on the functional difference between unpredictability and randomness. Seems there's a difference in how the outcome is generated, but not in the outcomes that can be generated. Like anything "unpredictability" gives you, you can also get from "randomness"--and vis versa. Randomness is also inherently unpredictable, after all XD<br/><br/>Is there an example you could give where unpredictability gives you something that randomness cannot?<br/><br/>On a related note, I have tried to reduce the sheer randomness of the rolls. D&amp;D was frustrating, particularly at low levels, because your character's strengths have so little impact on the result. If you have a +1 modifier on a D20 roll, the D20 roll has a whole lot more influence over the final number (1-20) than your modifier does. So with Frames, it's much more equal; D6 (1-6) + Frame (1-6). So your character is just as important as the randomness. If you have a +6, you're a lot more likely to succeed than if you had a +1.<br/><br/>How does that factor in to the "randomness is bad" ethos? (Don't worry; I know I'm exaggerating.)<br/><br/><b>Burned</b>: I read through some of that. Sounds interesting, if a little time consuming. Good example of the players having more control over the outcomes, though! The idea of deciding ahead of time what could happen, but then rolling to find out is pretty awesome...<br/><br/><b>Development</b>: If the character does something awesome while in a problematic frame of mind, there is a simple rule. And general success/failure helps them for the rest of that scene. But when they reflect on the events of a Thread, it is rolled for. Not sure if this is the best idea or not, but in the limited testing I've played it seems to keep that part surprising--like in a TV show where you think their story arc is clear, and they're going to turn into a better person... but they see things in a twisted way and turn even darker.<br/><br/>So overcoming despite, or being overwhelmed despite, have clear impacts on how that character sees that moment (no randomness). Whereas when they just generally reflect on the past couple of days when they saw themselves in one of the goons... they could find resolve in not becoming like them (Frame goes down, trying to be less active in that Frame), or they could accept that that's who they are and they'll never change (Frame goes up, now they're better in 'brawl mode').<br/><br/>I can see this being frustrating to some players who want full control over their character arc... but this game is all about the eddies and turbulence; characters being pulled this way and that and doing their best to make it to the other side and "do the thing."<br/><br/><b>Why Roll for challenges?</b>: I think this has two parts to it. If I consider no rolls at all...<br/><br/>First, someone with a +1 stat would only draw, at best. Being +1 Shy will always be a problem and they would never overcome it. They won't get +s from smaller successes, and there would be no randomness of the universe that happens to make things go their way. <i>With</i> randomness, they may just be having a better day dealing with things, the universe might throw them a bone and help them out somehow... and mechanically, there's a slim chance they may take a more permanent step towards overcoming their shyness.<br/><br/>Same goes for someone with +6 "I'm Awesome!" they'd be a Mary Sue character who always wins because they always think they're awesome and they're never proven wrong. They wouldn't change either.<br/><br/>So there needs to be some sort of randomness (or pseudo-randomness) to allow any change whatsoever. An alternative could be for players to set up events specifically to change a character in some way. That could work fine, but that's not the kind of game and kind of story I want to tell. In that... it forces a certain kind of story on the players.<br/><br/>The way I see it, if players have control over their characters' fate, their growth, what challenges they come up against, etc... then they're not roleplaying characters, but rather meta beings that hover above them. The whole story would be manipulated to serve preconceived ideas of who the characters will become, and to drag them there whether they like it or not.<br/><br/>The game I want to make (and play) is one where the system itself encourages growth and change in the characters, and encourages satisfying storytelling with good structure. But one where the players aren't in control over pretty much any of it.<br/><br/>I've written a fair few stories (and more than a few half-finished novels). I love the way I can manipulate things to be just right and to have the maximum impact on the reader. And I sort of have that hat on when playing RPGs too. But that's where it can get frustrating.<br/><br/>If I want some cool character moment to come off too much, then if it doesn't I just want to flip a table. But at the same time, if everything went according to how I see it in my head... why aren't I just writing a story? For me, the beauty and fun of playing an RPG is interpreting outcomes into awesome story beats, but not being able to predict where things will go.<br/><br/>For example, Matt Mercer of Critical Role fame, does this really well. He works the characters' backstories into the story as a whole. He gives them moments to shine as they fell the boss. But none of that is part of D&amp;D; that's all coming from Matt's noggin.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to do, is put what I understand about story structure and character arcs and development into a game. You can still have your swashbuckling adventures or tragic character dramas... but the game helps you give satisfying conclusions to each story arc, and to prompt change within the characters.<br/><br/>I guess you could use parts of it as a tool to give more depth to other RPGs. But the pieces actually work well together--linking what happens and what the characters encounter to their own personalities, and so giving good reasons for why they could reflect on what happened, and how that could cause them to grow as a person. So to me it feels like it's becoming a full system.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just biting more off than I can chew for my first game design...

Every story is based around conflict of some kind. And these conflicts are what push the characters and drive the story. But that's all high level. The individual actions that try to overcome obstacles are what the characters themselves experience. They may not know about the evil overlords pulling the strings, but they know all about getting beat up by the Stormtroopers. ^^<br/><br/>So in my mind, the only way for people to grow is for things to happen to them and for them to do things to overcome problems--all at that more granular level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468247/#Comment_468247" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-06T18:48:33+00:00" title="December  6, 2017  6:48PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2017 7:00PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" rel="nofollow">tapgiles</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I like having low-level actions succeed or fail, because it can drastically affect the route a PC takes to overcome a problem, and so affect the whole story; and I'm not sure how more low-level stuff would be done without simple randomness...<br/><br/>...But also, I guess I'm just not sure on why randomness is less good/useful/enjoyable to play with than a thing that's technically not random but feels just as random.

I'm honoured you'd go that far, to give feedback ^^<br/><br/><b>Frames</b>: I certainly need to tweak the explanation of this part. The tricky thing is that in scenes, the most important part is the frame of mind. But for story generation (and roleplaying, depending on how deep you are into that side of things), the event is way more important. Plus, the frame of mind comes <i>from</i> the event, which flips it inside out once more.<br/><br/>The way I see it, the options are the following:<br/><br/><i>Roll, Event, Belief, Frame of Mind (the thought in the moment that causes you to act), Frame.</i> This is how it's done currently. Though as you say, the roll doesn't connect to the frame until much later. The advantage is that the rolled value informs what kind of event is created, and then the rest is in chronological order until you get to the result of the event.<br/><br/>For me, coming up with the event first helps me figure out what specific Frame word should be used. If people need to discuss exactly what they want that feeling to be but they're not exactly sure, they can look back at the event and belief to narrow it down into something really specific--and therefore more useful in-game.<br/><br/><i>Roll, Frame, Frame of Mind, Belief, Event.</i> This is probably easier for the player to get their head around, but it's all backwards chronologically. So they may end up with an event that no longer fits the resulting frame of mind.<br/><br/><i>Event, Roll, Belief, Frame of Mind, Frame.</i> This could work, I guess. Start with an event, but then roll to find out how it affected you, and go from there. Would this be easier to understand as a player? Or would it throw another spanner in the works? (I think this is one you suggested, actually.)<br/><br/>See, originally, the rolled value was to dictate if the Frame was a positive or negative one (eg. Defend, Revenge). It helped suggest an event and frame to the player, but didn't really produce very useful words for story generation which is why I tweaked things. But now, the roll doesn't have too much impact on the event itself--potentially leaving the players in the dark with no idea of what to do.<br/><br/>Though now I'm warming up to the event-first idea. Anyone like to comment on the options?<br/><br/><b>Rolling Arcs</b>: Let me discuss those points separately...<br/><br/><i>Two Frames with the same value</i>: If this happens, you'd just note both of them down. You only tend to use one of the rolled words to start the next scene, so you'd just choose one of them. As time goes on, they will likely diverge from each other and the problem will solve itself.<br/><br/>Potentially, there could be an added mechanic for these situations. I could go the easy route and say during character creation, just re-roll a value if it's the same as one already used. Or I could embrace it more, and make it important. In creation, if you need to add a Frame with the same value, link it together with the other Frame/event. And when it's rolled as an arc, something special repeatedly happens that combines those two (a person related to those events keeps appearing, etc.).<br/><br/>I'd have to think about it some more; maybe I'll tweak things after some more playtesting. But for now, it should work fine just doing things as normal. Are there any issues you can foresee with rolling one of these doubles?<br/><br/><i>Re-rolls</i>: Yes, you could theoretically have to re-roll forever, I guess. ;D Though the likelihood of one of three dice hitting on one of 3 numbers is 50%. And after two rolls it's 75%. I've never had to re-roll more than once, myself. (<a href="http://anydice.com/program/dd54" rel="nofollow">Anydice</a>)<br/><br/>The cards idea would work. Though it does sound like a lot of extra work on the players' part to make all of those rather than just roll some dice. And shuffling index cards would be a bit of a pain.<br/><br/><b>Story element (more below)</b>: Yeah... there really isn't any instructions, rules, or steps for how to create a story element. You just sort of "make something up." But I added a section of advice on how you might go about doing this in case the reader didn't know where to start. So there is nothing you <i>need</i> to read "below"; I just wanted to let the reader know that there is something to help them if they need it.<br/><br/>I've moved the advice into that same section, but I'm kind of worried about losing the thread of what they actually have to do because they had to read a couple of pages of advice that they didn't need to read in the first place. How does it work for you now?<br/><br/>I've also reminded the reader these are "Frame words" in that paragraph to avoid confusion--as it's a pretty new concept at that point for the first-time reader. Let me know if that helped.<br/><br/><b>Thread specifics</b>: I've added a note about involving one or more story elements to flesh out what the thread means for <i>your</i> story. And I've expanded the example to help make it clear how that could be done. So yeah, I think you got it pretty spot on. Hopefully those changes makes things easier to understand from the text, though?<br/><br/>This is indeed the part where you find all your details and actually set up the game-proper. I actually had a session 0 to create characters recently, but we got way too into world building. <i>This</i> is the worldbuilding section. I've added a note about this early in the Roll Arcs section to make it clear.<br/><br/><b>Scene setup</b>: This is basically an added thing you can do if you feel like it. There are rules for Creating Opposition, and to set up Events like a randomised countdown. So that part is mainly just to say you're allowed to use those mechanics to create stuff you already know you're going to need later. You could always wait for the NPC to turn up and <i>then</i> Create Opposition if you wish, for example. But if you want to do it early when Creating a Scene, you may.<br/><br/>I've changed things to hopefully explain this better, as well as expanding on those examples. I hope it's easier to understand, now?<br/><br/>There is nothing dictating what constitutes a given Thread, or a scene. It's all played by ear by the players themselves. I'd like to leave the kinds of stories as open as possible. In a Place Thread, you could face off an entire army to break into their fortress. Or you could climb the wall. Or it could be a brief scene with no opposition whatsoever and you simply waltz in in disguise.<br/><br/>Another factor in this design is that you never know what's going to happen next. You can introduce new things using the selected Frame words so that things pop up at inopportune moments. Having an ingredients list of things that should be created would take away some of that sense of surprise.<br/><br/>The way you described the rules would work, I'm sure. But it's just not quite what I want this game to be.<br/><br/>Just a quick note... NPCs and "villains" are both forms of opposition. And you play one scene at a time, each scene starting a new Thread (which can potentially end at the end of the scene). Was that unclear from the rules?<br/><br/>[to be continued...]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468250/#Comment_468250" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-06T18:56:48+00:00" title="December  6, 2017  6:56PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">@Vivificient</a>: [...continued]<br/><br/><b>Conflict resolution</b>: I think the 3 Frames tend to be broad enough as to fit any situation. I can see it could be a problem, but I can't think of a counter example to demonstrate your point.<br/><br/>The way I see it, a lot of games need you to find the stat that fits the situation or the action. Moving a boulder? Strength. Aiming an arrow? Dexterity. But here, it's all in the character's head. There's no right answer, necessarily. So when deciding which frame of mind your character is in, it's whatever the character is feeling in that moment. And if it's not obvious, or it's a toss-up between two of them, you have to choose.<br/><br/>For example, here is a Frame set one of my players recently created: +4 Empathetic, +5 Confident, +1 Untrusting. Say they're meeting their boyfriend's parents for the first time. She's not necessarily empathetic towards them, as she doesn't know what's going on in their heads. She's more nervous than confident. And she doesn't know them, so how could she mistrust them?<br/><br/>Well, you have to pick one for that first impression. And as there's no clear answer, you could pick any one of them. You may pick up on the fact they have a dog; common ground makes you empathise with them, being friendly. Or you may put on a brave face and <i>act</i> confident--putting your "belief" ahead of your momentary discomfort. Or you could immediately take a disliking to the father, mistrusting his "phony smile."<br/><br/>If you can think of a situation for the same character that you think wouldn't fit the Frames, I'd be up for tackling it?<br/><br/>Consider this unlikely character as example to test this... +5 Generous, +6 Hopeful, +2 Happy-go-lucky. They walk through a decimated city, destroyed by a decade of nuclear warfare, a city where his mother died from the first blast. You'd think that character would be sad, that he couldn't possibly be generous, hopeful, or happy-go-lucky. But... he just is. That's who he is. He sees the beauty of the odd flower growing out of a tank. The sky is clear and blue, making a beautiful day. He's in the city where his mother once lived and breathed and pottered about.<br/><br/>Because of what he's gone through before. You made that character. He's complex, he's seen some things, he may even be a little doo-lally. But that's who he is! ^^<br/><br/>So it kind of pushes you to roleplay off of one of your defining beliefs, and should (hopefully) make for stronger characterisation.<br/><br/><b>Decisiveness</b>: No doubt I need to work on this. It's tricky to get my head around how I should be going about writing the rules, when it's such an open system. I mean, think of something like D&amp;D most of the stuff you play through comes out of the DM's head, rather than going through the instructions in the book to figure out what monster the adventurers have to fight next. They just choose.<br/><br/>So more experience, and more reading will help with this, I'm sure. Also, I'll be slowly redrafting parts as I go, based on everyone's comments here.<br/><br/>Also, I've not played this with my group properly quite yet, so there is no standard way to play. XD But great idea!<br/><br/>And yeah. The nitty-gritty of the mechanics aren't set in stone either, because I haven't playtested it beyond a couple of solo games. I hope you'll come back to the forum to see future iterations of the game when it makes more sense ^^<br/><br/>Thanks again for your comments, and for giving it a quick test. Much appreciated!

It's not that randomness is a particular issue - we just got into a little side conversation about it here somewhat arbitrarily. It's that your design seems to be ABOUT a very specific kind of thing, and then suddenly we get to rolling dice and we're talking about task-resolution challenges resolved via die-rolling... to many of us it sounds a bit like the designer had all these great ideas and then suddenly  gave up when he got to the next part of the design. ("Eh, let's just throw in some D&amp;D-esque die roll here." "That's my new dish! I want to be totally different from European cuisine. Uh, but I guess I'll put cheese all over it, too.")<br/><br/>But, since you asked, here's another example of something you're familiar with which can benefit from being non-random (and yet remain unpredictable):<br/><br/>The GM puts together a dungeon, and lists a few hidden items in various corners. Perhaps there's a desk, and underneath it someone has taped on an envelope holding an important letter... that kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Option 1: When you enter a new room in the dungeon, roll your Search skill. On a 10 or better, the GM tells you about anything hidden in the room.<br/><br/>Option 2: While exploring the dungeon, you have a certain amount of time. During that time, feel free to use any methods you can think of to search the dungeon, and tell the GM exactly what you're doing and where you're looking. <br/><br/>If you choose a method which would be likely to work, and search in a place with a hidden item, the GM tells you about the hidden item you find. (For instance, saying, "I bend over and look underneath the desk," would result in the GM telling you about the hidden letter.)<br/><br/>You can see that the second process does not use randomness. So, how is it different from the first one? What does it say about the game? What player skills does it involve? What approaches to play does it reward and which approaches does it punish? How might the game feel different if you choose Option 1 over Option 2?<br/><br/>That kind of thing is, in my opinion, what a game designer should be doing.<br/><br/>Personally, I think the process (whether it's die-rolling or something else) needs to be related to the Frames. Perhaps you roll dice to overcome your own Frames, or to use them in situations where they don't fit? Something like that, something which engages with the theme of character growth.<br/><br/>Otherwise your game may be just fine, but it threatens to look a bit like Option 1, above. I like designs where rolling the dice or otherwise consulting game procedures leads us to question, reinforce, or overcome the themes of the game, so we're consciously *engaging* with the source material and the desired shape of the game to come.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468258/#Comment_468258" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-06T22:09:12+00:00" title="December  6, 2017 10:09PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a>: Cheers, mate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468260/#Comment_468260" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-06T22:36:05+00:00" title="December  6, 2017 10:36PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: Oh, okay.

You'd add some detail to the past event that makes it relevant to the action at hand.<br/><br/>I kinda liked how it would slowly make the memory more and more vivid and detailed... but it slowed everything down, and players found it super difficult to choose a stat to use. Also, it was really hard to use some of the words generated in that way to generate story elements and such. ;P<br/><br/>That's when the Frames were born--a much more logical version of the same concept. And while I don't think it's 100% stable in its current form, it plays a lot better, and fits what I was really going for in the first place.<br/><br/>I guess with time and reading other RPGs for inspiration, that'll happen for conflict resolution also. I hope, at least XD<br/><br/><b>Option 2</b>: Hrm... I think I get what you're saying. Though I'm not sure that kind of situation would work in a GM-less system.<br/><br/>When there's a GM, they can know things the players don't. But when everyone is privy to everything, the <i>system</i> has to "know" things the players don't--see what I mean? I feel like there needs to be a way of "asking" the system what happens if you want things this low level to be unpredictable, and that no one at the table knows about yet.<br/><br/>I think I get your general point though. (Though I'm just as likely to be wrong.) For a while I couldn't get my head around why you were suggesting "randomness" (dice rolls) were not as good as "unpredictability." But to me, if it's random-ish, it's random. Who cares how it's generated?<br/><br/>I'm thinking maybe you were referring more to how thematic the generation is, how closely it ties into the other themes and mechanics supported by the system already. And I'm still not sure if the Frame rolls are thematic or not.<br/><br/>On the one hand, it is straight-up D&amp;D rolling. On the other hand, part of how I arrived at what the Frames are is <i>because</i> of that mechanic. I thought real hard about what such a roll represents, and how to boil it down to its base elements. Frames are how well you act in a certain frame of mind. It's how well you <i>act</i> because the number associated with the Frame literally influences how well you act, when you roll for an action. And the die roll itself represent the idea that not everything is as simple as that. You can be on top of the world, thinking you're invincible... but sometimes you'll fall flat on your face. And you can be down in the dumps, thinking there's no way out of this depression... but sometimes you'll see a bird out your window and think life's not so bad.<br/><br/>As a newbie designer, it's really hard for me to know if I'm just spouting crap or if it actually makes sense for the mechanic. It certainly makes sense to me, but maybe more experienced designers like you guys know this is a common pitfall and everyone wanders down this rabbit hole at the start.<br/><br/>Pfff... I dunno. It's late. Interested to hear your thoughts on this, though. This is a great conversation, and I'm learning a lot!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468262/#Comment_468262" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-06T23:42:37+00:00" title="December  6, 2017 11:42PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're on the right track now, I'd say!<br/><br/>The technique I'm referencing *does* benefit from sort of impartial "referee" in order to function, but that can be done in a number of ways. Just off the top of my head:<br/><br/>* Players rotate through various functions as the game progresses. The game is set up so that these roles are correctly motivated; i.e. frees you up to be an impartial referee when that's your job, without "crossing wires" with the things you do in the rest of the game.<br/><br/>* The secret information (in this case, the location of hidden items) is recorded earlier in some form (like an adventure module). As the players play, they can access this record to verify whether their attempts locate anything or not. Or perhaps we have a set of cards, folded in half, with the secret information on them, and our job is to place them somewhere on the table, so only one player knows WHERE a thing is and no one knows WHAT the thing is at all.<br/><br/>* The secret information is generated in play, by the players, and then hidden. For instance, when we invent a new space, one player is designated to roll a die, and, on a 3 or higher, she writes the name of a secret item and places it in an envelope. Given the right conditions, later in the game, we might get to open that envelope.<br/><br/>* With newer technology, who knows what we could do. Perhaps we use geolocation to key secret information, so that moving around with your phone allows you to access the information. Or perhaps we harness a whole crowd of "online players" (like in a chatroom) who are fans of the game, and we must ask THEM to reveal to us when we search in the right location.<br/><br/>But, anyway, that was just for illustration; I'm not actually suggesting any of these would be good designs.<br/><br/>But consider, for instance, how different your game would be if each character had pools of tokens, attached to each Frame, and during a challenge/contest, he or she had to blindly bid a number of them. (As does his or her opponent, presumably.)<br/><br/>Maybe that would be a better game; maybe it would be a poorer game. I don't know - the point is that it's an element of the design to consider.<br/><br/>My advice at this point:<br/><br/>Keep the d6+add format of the Frames, if it works for you. That's not so much the issue here. The first issue is to decide <i>under what circumstances you want players to be rolling that die</i>. That's going to say some major things about your game. When do we roll dice? Who decides when those conditions are met? What do we do the rest of the time, when those conditions aren't met?<br/><br/>That, I think, will be a really significant point upon which the strength of your design will rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468269/#Comment_468269" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-07T03:05:33+00:00" title="December  7, 2017  3:05AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2017 3:06AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>The first issue is to decide <i>under what circumstances you want players to be rolling that die</i>.

I've already had some thoughts on the subject, some ideas I'll try out sometime.

Cogs are turning. ^^<br/><br/>As for when an action should be rolled, I'll just be playing as GM for now, so I'll simply decide.

If you lose the contest, though, reduce its rating by 1.<br/><br/>* Treat your Frame rating as two points lower. However, increase one of your other Frames by 1. If you win, recover one point to the Frame you used.<br/><br/>* Treat your Frame as two points higher. After the contest, reduce it by 1, as well as another Frame of your choice.<br/><br/>This is not a slick presentation (I didn't give it much thought), but given the right inputs with something like this you could create a system where the player must consider "how confident is my character feeling? How will this affect this Frame in the future?" each time a conflict manifests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468286/#Comment_468286" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-07T23:29:35+00:00" title="December  7, 2017 11:29PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: That's another cool idea! But for me, it doesn't fit what I'd like play to be.<br/><br/>With a mechanic like that, first you select the Frame from how you're roleplaying the action in the first place, next you make a blind bit with your own Frames/beliefs against the opposition's Frames/beliefs, then you permanently change Frame values (how confident you are acting on those beliefs), and you find out what happens.<br/><br/>For me, that's way too meta-gamey. With roll+Frame, first you select the Frame from how you're roleplaying the action, second you find out what happens. It's not about the speed of the mechanic, though that's a plus. I guess I just want to get out of the way of the roleplaying as much as possible.<br/><br/>With the mechanic you suggested, there's a lot more than straight roleplaying that you have to consider when you take action. So while playing you have to weigh risks and gamble on the right options. And the change in the person would be based on what you picked in this higher-level meta minigame, rather than what the character has been through.<br/><br/>I don't mean to slap down your idea or anything. I actually think these things are helping me zero in on what I want my game to feel like in these moments.<br/><br/>I guess in theory, I could just not have granular conflict resolution mechanics at all (like Fiasco?) and let the story simply play out; that would <i>really</i> get out of the way of the roleplaying. But then I suppose I wouldn't have the surprise turns of events that shape the story low-level. Hrm...

However! These are built on beliefs, on events. And not all beliefs were created equal.<br/><br/>Here's what we came up with for one of the Frames:<br/><br/><i>Event</i>: He was chasing down a murderer, his partner lost way back. He comes face-to-face with the murderer, but finds he is way outmatched. Someone else he's never met before (one of the other characters) appears and begins battle with the murderer, allowing him to tastefully retreat.<br/><br/><i>Belief</i>: We all have a part to play.<br/><br/><i>Frame</i>: +5 Insight.<br/><br/>The reasoning is that he will look for ways to use people most effectively. But it's not so much an "active" Frame, from the looks of it. It doesn't move him to physically do anything.<br/><br/>He's sort of become a "support class" character who hangs in the back--that's fine, considering the other details of his character.<br/><br/>But his Frames are all to do with planning and positioning--which aren't necessarily things you'd need to roll for. Any planning needs to be roleplayed, essentially; I (the GM) aren't going to give them the perfect plan if they roll high.<br/><br/>Is this a problem?<br/><br/>I don't know. Might be just fine. I'll sleep on it and see if it's clearer in the morning, but I thought I'd leave his here in case someone sees a flaw within the character creation rules someplace. ^^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Prompt, an RPG - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21382/prompt-an-rpg/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Prompt, an RPG - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21382/prompt-an-rpg/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Insight should either : make the GM give intel, or allow the player to make up elements and links.

And there is no difference between mental, social, and physical actions that you roll; they all work exactly the same way.<br/><br/>The problem is that one of the ways Frames change is because they <i>acted</i> and the outcome either overcame their limiting beliefs, or undermined their motivating beliefs. This is really the whole point of the Frames system--the way they are changed by the character's actions.<br/><br/>The other side of this is that this comes from a belief. A belief doesn't change how well you think; it changes how you think. Believing "We all have a part to play" doesn't make you inherently better at reading people, or planning, or thinking about a situation. But you can <i>act</i> differently based on that belief.<br/><br/>For example, you can allow your ally to do a thing instead of charging in and trying to do it yourself when you're less suited to the task (this fits perfectly with the event, by the way). The character has the same "amount" of insight and intuition and intelligence as they had before adopting this belief, but they are moved to use it and asses the situation first, instead of relying on their own abilities.<br/><br/>So there's a hypothetical situation which prods the character's belief that "We all have a part to play." So he acts differently because of that belief, and considers who might be the best to deal with the situation. What's going through his mind? Why does he act? Maybe it's something like "This can go sideways real fast if we don't get this right." Or "This is beyond my capabilities." Or "I need help!"<br/><br/>Then what should the Frame word be? What's a word that captures this way of thinking? It's not a simple recognition of the dangers involved. It's taking those things into account before they mess everything up. It's pausing to consider the situation. Maybe it's "Cautious" or something? "Shrewd," maybe?<br/><br/>Does this line of reasoning even work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468337/#Comment_468337" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-08T23:15:55+00:00" title="December  8, 2017 11:15PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the character has "the same amount of insight" with Insight +5 or without I wonder what Insight +5 means.

That's why I don't think something like "Insight" is the right word. Insight speaks to how observant someone is ("His eye twitched!"), and how clever they are at figuring out what they have observed means ("He's bottling up his anger!").<br/><br/>This is definitely fine for games to have mechanics for, but it's not what I want in my game. If the defining core of my game is belief, and how beliefs move you to act or to hold back (manifesting in the Frames)... then my game should focus on <i>action</i>--the result of the belief itself.<br/><br/>Beliefs can change how you think, and therefore how you act. Beliefs cannot make you smarter, or more observant, or give you knowledge.<br/><br/>The advantage of this--the reason I'm designing things this way--is so that all the mental stuff is handled through roleplay. If the <i>player</i> figures out a thing, they can act on it. They don't have to roll to find out if their character is as smart as them. And if they roll high, they don't have to be told what they figure out by the GM. All they need to do is roleplay having those beliefs, and say what they do. That's it.<br/><br/>So effectively, there are no mechanics to handle mental stuff. The players have minds of their own, and naturally handle that stuff themselves. They can still ask, "I want to build a fire, to smoke them out. In this garage, are there oily rags or something?"<br/><br/>And if we go with "Alert," for example, the action would be to stop and look around, alert to any dangers. Because of this action, after a roll, I will tell them anything relevant they notice that they wouldn't have noticed if they just ran in without thinking. Not because they're observant, but because they chose to look.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468353/#Comment_468353" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-09T14:23:11+00:00" title="December  9, 2017  2:23PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2017 3:04PM by DeReel.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you actually question a player's right to chose Insight as a Frame ?

You believe a thing is true.<br/>2. Your belief affects your thinking when certain things are in your environment. Something in your surroundings relates to the thing you believe to be true. It will cause you to think about your belief. Maybe strengthen or reevaluate the belief. Maybe you simply draw different conclusions from what you're experiencing, and see things differently to how you would without the belief. <br/>3. Your belief moves you to action in more specific situations. It motivates you to perform certain actions, whereas before you had this belief you would not have.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>1. Belief: "The death of a human being at the hands of another is murder."<br/>2. Thought: When hearing on the news that a serial killer's execution date has been set... "Even the worst of the worst should be apprehended, not killed."<br/>3. Action: A terrorist dangles off the edge of a cliff, and you have the power to save him or let him fall to his death. You think "I cannot let him die." You reach down and pull him to safety. Or when trying to convince a lynch mob not to string up a thief, you are moved to reason with them to let the thief go.<br/><br/>Now to relate these things back to the mechanics...<br/>1. Belief: Created in character creation.<br/>2. Thought: This is essentially the "frame of mind," which is captured in the Frame word. When they think differently because of their belief, they are in this frame of mind. This general (thinking only) frame of mind stuff is completely handled by the player's roleplaying. It's up to them to simulate having that belief, and the thoughts and awareness they'd have as a result of it.<br/>3. Action: When a belief moves them to act, they roll an action. The roll combines the convictions of the character with that bit of chance from physically trying to do things, and pits it against whatever they are acting against.\n<blockquote><b>Sidenote</b>: Now, as part of those mechanics, the belief system of the character is simplified and abstracted. Currently, each action they take is "forced" into one of their Frames for the purposes of the mechanics. This sort of warps things a little, but then so do all RPGs; it's all abstraction at the end of the day.</blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a>: Not sure I get your meaning about questioning their right. I'm designing the rules; whatever rules I come up with will be stuck to, if they're playing my game. I'm aiming for a particular goal, for the mechanics to emulate a particular thing. And that thing is how conviction aids or hinders doing things.<br/><br/>Mental smarts aren't something that's handled by the game whatsoever. And physical prowess or ability aren't handled either. The only thing that matters to get things done in the game are your beliefs; that's the only thing modelled. It's just a case of modelling it correctly and conveying that in a way that makes sense to the reader.<br/><br/>Other games (what I call "World-focussed games") model physical and mental ability, but don't touch on the beliefs of the character. That's fine. But it's not what I'm trying to do.<br/><br/>There can be insightful characters, but that won't be modelled by the game. There can be genius characters, but that won't be modelled by the game.<br/><br/>In the real world, beliefs change your <i>way of thinking</i>. They do not change how clearly you think, how smart you are, how long it takes you to solve an equation, or how many digits of Pi you can remember. If you believe "It's better to be smart that stupid," that doesn't make you smarter. If you believe "Pi is the secret to unlocking my own telepathic powers," that doesn't allow you to remember Pi to more places.<br/><br/>If you believe the Red Sox are the best, that doesn't make you smarter or better in any way than someone who believes the Yankees are the best. You simply believe different things.<br/><br/>The Frames are not actions (or skills), but they <i>lead</i> to various actions because of that thought process alone. In choosing a belief and Frame, you aren't choosing an action you can do; you're choosing a frame of mind you can be in. That frame of mind, that way of seeing the world, that belief, will motivate you to do different things in different situations.<br/><br/>If you have the beliefs "Mice are dangerous" and "Fresh air is good for the soul," either could make you scale a cliff face. If there's a hoard of mice around, "Mice are dangerous" will move you to climb the wall. If you're just having some leisure time, "Fresh air is good for the soul" might move you to do some climbing just for fun. (Not great examples, but I hope you understand what I'm trying to say with it.) And "Mice are dangerous" could lead to you climbing a cliff to get away, or shooting a gun at them.<br/><br/>In choosing a Frame you're not limiting what's possible with it. The aim of asking the player to think of a circumstance in which they'd be moved to act because of their belief is to help them figure out what their frame of mind would be in that situation. The thinking is, when you act on a belief you're always in that same frame of mind. So figuring out the frame of mind from one possible action will help you find the frame of mind applicable to all actions involving that frame of mind.<br/><br/>So "Small" wouldn't be a good Frame. Maybe that's in there from an old draft or something. I'm currently in the middle of revising things to be more readable, and in line with my current understanding of what I want the game to be.<br/><br/>"Think twice" doesn't describe a frame of mind. An insightful character being good at assessing the situation doesn't have anything to do with their beliefs. I could see a belief like "The natives cannot be trusted" moving a person to look out for any signs of betrayal when interacting with those natives. But that doesn't mean he's any better at spotting those signs. A character can be blind, and still have the belief "The natives cannot be trusted." But they <i>would</i> be on the look out for signs of trouble. But what frame of mind is he in? Is he thinking "I should be insightful," or "I don't trust these people"?<br/><br/>If you can think of a belief could make someone better at assessing the situation, we could discuss it if you like?<br/><br/>Something like "insight" sounds like it would be used in a game calling for an "insight check" of some kind. You'd say to the GM "is he lying?" And the GM would say "give me an insight check." If you roll well, the GM will tell you if they're lying or not. If you roll poorly, the GM can simply tell you they don't seem to be lying, or you can't tell.<br/><br/>There is no such roll in Prompt. There is no mechanical way of drawing conclusions or making assumptions or making the right leaps of logic. The GM describes the state of the world as it appears to the characters. The players can ask for more description on various things--"Does he look nervous? Is there anything suspicious about him? An eye twitch or something?"--and the GM will tell them what they see. It's up to them to figure out if an eye twitch means deception, or the light's in their eyes, or they just have a twitch.<br/><br/>DeReel, I really appreciate your feedback on this. As I say, it's still all coming together in my own head, so it's very helpful to bounce things off of people and see if it makes sense to them. However, in your latest reply it felt like I was being judged. You know what I'm aiming for. If you think what the changes and tweaks I suggest work against that, you can say so. But "I'm disappointed" and "A Frame like Think twice is very helpful, thank you" feels like you're dismissing what I'm saying, rather than discussing and reasoning on the points so that I can see the counter arguments.<br/><br/>It's only a little thing, but I'd appreciate it if you'd resume your usual brash but respectful way of putting things ^^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468371/#Comment_468371" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-10T14:16:56+00:00" title="December 10, 2017  2:16PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: As I said in the reply just above this one, I don't think a belief can actually make you smarter or mentally keener in any way.<br/><br/>If someone's tried for years to understand calculus but just can't understand it, would believing "Calculus is one of the most important things to understand in life" help them understand it any better? Would it make them able to learn how it works now that they believe this? I'd love to discuss this more if you wish.<br/><br/>They <i>do</i>, as you say, make you see things differently and change what you might be on the lookout for. But those are different to your inborn ability to calculate. If you believe "The roman empire is one of the greatest atrocities in history," then if you saw an ancient roman colosseum you'd probably see the death and destruction that was carried out there instead of the impressive architectural achievement of building it in the first place... But that doesn't make you a historian on roman history.<br/><br/>That would be an interesting game you described, though. Maybe the GM gives each player a different description, based on their character's beliefs. For Prompt, though, that perception is happening in the player's heads instead. It's simply reflected in the questions they ask the GM, rather than being simulated by the system.<br/><br/>But again--I don't think how things are seen by someone is linked to how clever they are at all. I'd be up for discussing this further, though; maybe there's some nuance I'm missing that helps me understand your view of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468373/#Comment_468373" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-10T17:02:34+00:00" title="December 10, 2017  5:02PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was bitter because I am a huge fan of open traits.

I didn't see it as a radical change, myself. The mental Frames the player came up with was an outlier; most came up with Frames they could act on. But I can see you assumed it was perfectly allowable. This is why I need to tweak the guidelines in the rules.<br/><br/>First... if there are no restrictions, no guidelines, for how to create the Frames, then you'll end up making a lot of other stuff not work anymore. People could put any word they feel like, completely unrelated to a character at all. If "Tractor" is not a good trait, then there needs to be guidelines in place to avoid having it as a trait.<br/><br/>I think my general avoidance of mental stats/rolls comes from my own experiences. Giving a great speech to someone convincing them to let your ally go is awesome! <i>You</i> did that, not a roll of the dice. It's roleplay, it's putting yourself in the character's shoes, it's making their priorities yours. And it's really cool to see it happen in a player. But then you have to "roll persuasion," and you roll a 2, and all that hard work and awesomeness goes to waste.<br/><br/>Same for things like searching a room for traps, or putting together clues. You could have a roll for that and get nowhere despite the fact that you as the player figured it out ages ago. Or vis versa--you have no clue what the answer is, but you say "can I roll insight" or something, roll high, and the GM has to just tell you the answer.<br/><br/>I want <i>all</i> the roleplaying to be done by the players. The advantage of this is that the system never interferes with it, never slows things down to see whether the thing they just said or thought is allowed to be followed to the logical end (eg. the person being convinced).<br/><br/>I see it as better not having the game tell you if you're smart. In Prompt, the character is as smart as you, as observant as you, as persuasive as you. This means you don't have to wait for a mechanic to let you know you can do something mentally.<br/><br/>The other reason to restrict what kinds of traits are allowed is so that the rest of the system makes sense. Does it make sense to gain +1 in "Short"? Does it make sense that you become smarter because of a fist fight you won in the last scene? Does it make sense to meet your long lost father again and get a +1 in "Climbing"? How do you turn "Climbing" into a story element with the Thread "Question"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468376/#Comment_468376" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-10T18:44:07+00:00" title="December 10, 2017  6:44PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2017 7:09PM by DeReel.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that's a clear choice. So no mental or social rolls.<br/>Of course, if "Tractor" is a frame of mind, it should be perfectly alright. It is just short for the state of flux I am in when I drive my tractor under hypnosis by the hum of the motor. Same for "short", which means I feel discriminated against and lessened by others. <br/>So choosing "Insight" would be more like Trelawney posturing and not getting visions. Now I understand. <br/>Does it go as far as you barring un-conscious Frames ? That would explain why you insisted on force of Will : in such a system, it's the Omni-can-opener.  Because : I will. It can apply to everything the character is conscious of.<br/>But I understand it like this : you want to designate a  "safe zone" for beginners that will be easier to navigate, Force of Will being the center of it. There it will be clear what qualifies or not for a roll. And you put a stop sign in the grey zone, for things that can be played but can be more difficult to interpret. There be monsters, and maybe some unicorns.<br/><br/>By the way, to all your examples in the last paragraph I can answer a resounding NO. Nothing makes sense on is own. People make sense of things.<br/>+1 in short : I've been discriminated against and lessened, but now I see how it makes me different and richer<br/>I won the fight, I proved myself. Now the constant fear is gone I can think more clearly.<br/>This "Climbing" is a frame of mind. It means that I have to concentrate on my techniques to go past the pain because if I don't, I'll freeze to death like my partner did. So yes, if pain and hope were involved, meeting my father is like reaching the top of the cliff. I can finally rest and cry and laugh about it all again.<br/>A "climbing" element. Maybe it's a pyramyd scheme ? A mason ritual ? an ambitious NPC climbing up the social ladder ? Or a flight of stairs leading to a theater projection of Psycho ?<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles" title="tapgiles"><img alt="tapgiles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tapgiles">tapgiles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468386/#Comment_468386" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-11T12:30:41+00:00" title="December 11, 2017 12:30PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a>: It was always a clear choice on my side, just so you know XD<br/><br/>I can see how you could twist those to work as metaphors. But it would be unintuitive in play. It's much easier to pick between "Generous" "Suspicious" and "Heroic" for a given situation than between "Tractor" "Elephant" and "Crossbeam." XD<br/><br/>It's a lot easier to start with a random word and make up an event and frame of mind for it. But that's now how life works, and so that's not how the game works. If someone's asked: "What pivotal event changed you forever? What belief did it instill in you? What's going on in your head when you're moved to action because of that belief? What word best encompasses that frame of mind?"... I'm not sure how they'd end up with the word "Tractor," or "Climbing." ;D<br/><br/>Also, these words will be used to generate story elements and narrative. If you end up with weird Frame words, it can be very difficult trying to spin them into something that makes sense within the story. But this is specifically so that it relates back to the character, poking at their beliefs and prompting growth and change. If you interpret "Climbing" as an ambitious NPC, that has nothing to do with the PC's view of that word--about climbing a mountain and the death of his friend, and so on.<br/><br/>Yes, the Frames should be conscious. You can't belief in something unless you're aware you believe it. ^^ This is also because the character will be reflecting on what's happened recently, and taking another look at their beliefs and how strong their conviction in them is. They can't reason on their beliefs if they don't know they're there.<br/><br/>I guess that's one way of looking at it, with the "safe zone." Another way of looking at it is that if at any point the rules are unclear--Which Frame should I roll? What does it mean, to get +1 in this Frame?--the flow of the game is messed with, and the roleplaying is stunted as a result. So in my mind, it's simply "good game design." (Not saying I have enough experience to call my game that, by I made these design choices to strive for good game design.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468395/#Comment_468395" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-11T16:16:39+00:00" title="December 11, 2017  4:16PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>A really easy and accessible example is the Tabletop Fiasco episode, which is a YouTube video.
